Menachem Rosensaft, the son of two Holocaust survivors who became an international lawyer specialising in genocide, has spent much of his life trying to reconcile the horrors of the past with his Jewish faith.	Menachem Rosensaft, morwa wa bafalodi ba matlhotlhapelo ba babedi o a nnileng mmueledi yo o itsegeng boditšhabatšhaba ka go nyaolwa ga batho , o tshetse botshelo jwa gagwe jo bontsi a leka go kopana le masetlapelo a a fetileng le tumelo ya  Bajuta.
Rosensaft was born in 1948 in military barracks housing displaced persons, including survivors like his mother of the nearby Bergen-Belsen Nazi concentration camp.	Rosensaft o belegwe ka ngwaga wa 1948 kwa dikampeng tsa dintlo tsa sesole tsa batho ba ba tlositsweng, go akaretsa le bafalodi ba ba tshwanang le mmagwe wa kwa kampeng e e gaufi ya Bergen-Belsen Nazi.
His father survived five camps, including Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen.	Rraagwe o tshetse mo dikampeng tse tlhano, go akaretsa le Auschwitz le Bergen-Belsen.
Around 50 000 prisoners died at Bergen-Belsen, among them Anne Frank.	Batshwarwa ba ka nna 50 000 ka palo ba tlhokafaletse kwa Bergen-Belsen, magareng ga bona ke Anne Frank.
When British forces freed the camp in 1945, they found some 60 000 survivors, but nearly 14 000 died within two months from disease and malnutrition.	Fa sesole sa kwa Britain se se ne golola kampa ka ngwaga wa 1945, ba fitlhetse bafalodi ba ka nna 60 000, fela  ba ka nnang 14 000 ba tlhokafatse mo dikgweding di le pedi ka ntlha ya malwetse le tlhokego ya dikotla.
Rosensaft, an American, has turned to poetry to reflect in verse not only on the Holocaust but also recent attempts at genocide, such as in Bosnia and Rwanda, and also tackles racism and intolerance.	Rosensaft, wa Moamerika, o sekametse go poko go tlhagisa ka temana e seng fela mo Matlhotlhapelo fela gape le maiteko a a tswang mo dipolaong, jaaka kwa Bosnia le Rwanda, gape le go itebaganya le kgethololo ya mmala le go itshokela.
We know there are neo-Nazi forces, there are white supremacist forces in all parts of the world who, if allowed to, will perpetrate horrific acts, crimes against humanity, genocide against the other, Rosensaft said in a video interview from his home in New Jersey.	Re a itse gore go na le kgatelelo ya neo-Nazi, go na le kgatelelo ya basweu mo dikarolong tsotlhe tsa lefatshe, ke mang, fa go letleletswe, o tla dirang ditiro tse maswe, bosenyi kgatlhanong le batho, polao kgatlhanong le bangwe, Rosensaft o rile jalo mo kgatisong ya  ditherisano go tswa kwa legaeng la gagwe kwa New Jersey.
And the other can be Jews, Roma, Muslims, it can be the immigrant and the LGBTQ community and we all have to be on guard.	Mme ba bangwe e ka nna MaJuta, MaRoma, maMoseleme, e ka nna batswakwa le setšhaba sa LGBTQ  rotlhe re tshwanetse go nna kelotlhoko.
His book of verse, Poems Born in Bergen-Belsen, is being published in April by Kelsay Books to coincide with Yom Hashoah, the Jewish day of remembrance for Holocaust victims on April 9 and the anniversary of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen on April 15, 1945.

Rosensaft, who has visited Bergen-Belsen more than 25 times, wrestles in some of the 82 poems with what he called ghosts of those who will not leave places where they were killed.	Rosensaft, yo a etetseng Bergen-Belsen makgetlho a a fetang 25, o lwana mo mabokong a mangwe a le 82 le se a se bitsang dipoko tsa ba ba ka se tlogeleng mafelo ao ba bolaetsweng go ona

As guards herded them to the gas chamber, Benjamin asked his mother if they were going to live or die.	Fa basireletsi  aba kgoromeletsa kwa diphaposing tsa gase, Benjamin o ne a botsa  mmaagwe gore a ba tlile go tshela kgotsa go swa.
She did not answer	Ga a ka a mo araba.

When Rosensafts mother died in 1997, he realised that the only place Benjamin now lived was inside him.	Fa mmagwe Rosensafts a tlhokafala ka ngwaga wa 1997, o ne a lemoga gore ke lefelo le le nngwe fela le Benjamin o tlaa tshelang go lona, ke ka fa gare gagwe.
I see his face, I try to imagine his voice, I try to imagine his pain, his fear, his anguish and the one thing I know is that if I didnt remember him he would disappear, Rosensaft said.	Ke bona sefatlhego sa gagwe, ke leka go akanya lentswe la gagwe, ke leka go akanya kutlobotlhoko ya gagwe, le letshogo, mme selo se le sengwe se ke se itseng  ke gore fa ke sa mo gopole o tla nyelela,  go bua Rosensaft.

Up-and-coming musicians in Durban have come together to hold open-air busking performances in public spaces as part of the Independent Artists Busking Project.	Ka jalo, ke tota ke batla go itse ka ga seo, go bua Hammond.
The initiative provides a platform for musicians who have been struggling to earn a living during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It’s not nice because you stand in front of a big audience somewhere abroad and say all these nice things and the way we are treated as South African artists is not nice.	Jaaka ke bua le wena jaana, ke tlelwa ke bohutsana.

We’re getting closer to Freedom Day and we remember that wonderful moment in 1994 all kinds of South Africans came together to vote and in the same way music brings people together.	Ke akanya gore go botlhokwa thata mo Aforikaborwa gompieno go kopanya baagi botlhe ba naga, gore ba kgone go kopanela mo lefelong le le lengwe le go abelana maitemogelo a bona.
But we also have to remember that during this terrible time of COVID musicians and artists are some of the people who haven’t been able to make a living.	Letsatsi la Kgololosego le atumetse, mme re gakologelwa nako e le e e monate ka 1994. Mefuta yotlhe ya MaAforikaborwa e kopane go ya go tlhopha, mme ka tsela e e tshwanang le eo, mmino o kopanya batho.

This week, Tshwane Mayor Randall Williams conducted an oversight visit at the facility and indicated that the city wanted to take over the facility.	Gape le ne le le tshwanetse go nna le senthara ya ikatiso ya tlhabololo ya boeteledipele le go godisa bojanala mo khepetleleng.
We did indicate to the provincial government as the City of Tshwane that we are interested in taking over the project	Mo bekeng e, Ratoropo wa Tshwane Randall Williams o ile a etela kwa kagong eo mme a kaya fa ba batla go e tsaya.
but then if we are going to take over it becomes our project as the city.	Re le toropo ya Tshwane, re boleletse puso ya porofense gore re na le kgatlhego ya go tsaya porojeke e.
Then we’ll be able to fix and make sure it’s in good condition because one of the key pillars here in Tshwane which were mentioned by the mayor during his state of the capital address is that we want to attract tourism and we do see this monument as one of the key sites that would drive that tourism drive.	Mme fa e le gore re a e tsaya, e tlaa nna porojeke ya rona jaaka toropo.

The condition of the building has since worsened due to vandalism.	Dikgotlhang magareng ga borakonteraka ba ba tlhophilweng, di kaiwa jaaka lebaka la konokono le ke bakang tiego.
It was also declared a fire hazard by the city’s fire department, which declined to grant a certificate of occupancy.	Maemo a kago e a ile kwa tlase thata ka ntlha ya tshenyo.
The situation currently with the monument is that it is not in a good state since the monument was launched in 2016, the building does not have an occupancy certificate but also the building does not have full-time staff who make sure its in good condition or offer security.	Lefapha la tsa molelo la toropo, le begile fa kago e, e na le kotsi ya molelo mme le ganne go neelana ka setifikeiti sa bonno.
The building is not compliant with a number of building regulations, there’s also electrical cabling of the building that has been vandalized, several things in the building have been vandalized.	Maemo a ga jaana ka Sefikantswe ke gore, ga se mo maemong a a siameng fa e sale se sirololwa ka ngwaga wa 2016. Kago e, ga e na le setifikeiti sa bonno mme gape ga e na badiri ba ba ka netefatsang gore e mo maemong a a siameng kgotsa e babalesegile.
So, it’s not in a good state to be occupied, explains Stuurman.	Kago e ga e latele melawana e le mmalwa ya go aga. Gape go na le dithapo tsa motlakase tse di sentsweng. Dilo di le mmalwa mo kagong e o, di sentswe.
It costs the provincial department of Sports, Arts Culture and Recreation at least R2 million annually for the maintenance and upkeep of the unused facility.	Ka jalo, ga e mo maemong a a siameng go ka tsenwa go yona, go tlhalosa Stuurman.
The Democratic Alliance in the Gauteng Legislature has called on MEC, Mbali Hlophe, to prioritise the project in honour of the historical legacy of women.

It’s something they need to prioritise; some of the things they are prioritising are not benefitting the arts and heritage within the province.	Re ikutlwa jaaka e kete se, se tshwana fela le go latlhela madi mo mosimeng yo o boteng.
Maybe the department must start prioritising these things and ensure that the Gauteng community gets the value of these institutions, says Democratic Alliance’s Kingsol Chabalala.

The cancellation comes as the government is expected to issue a third state of emergency for Tokyo and a number of other prefectures that could last for about two weeks, according to media reports.

The halting of the auto show, a marquee event of the country’s most important industry, is also likely to raise more questions about the government’s insistence that the relayed Tokyo Olympics will go ahead this summer.

Japan has so far avoided an explosive spread of the pandemic that has plagued many Western countries, with total cases so far about 540 000 and a death toll of 9 707.	Ditlamorago tsa go tseya tirisong melao ya thibelo kwa Tokyo le Osaka e ka nna tse dikgolo thata.
But the latest rise in infections has stoked alarm, coming just three months before the planned start of the Tokyo Olympics and amid a sluggish vaccination roll out.

With thousands of new cases resulting from highly infectious strain of the virus, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said on Wednesday the government will decide this week whether to declare the state of emergency for major parts of the country.	Barulaganyi ba Tokyo 2020 ba re diteko tsa lepodisi le le neng le dira le ba torch Relay kwa diolimpiking kwa Bophirima jwa Kagawa, di bontshitse fa a na le mogare.
The governors of Tokyo’s neighbouring Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa prefectures will request the same emergency measures as the capital, the Nikkei newspaper reported.

Japan’s economy has emerged from last year’s severe slump thanks to robust exports.	Kgaolo ya Osaka e begile dikgetse di le 1 167, palo e e leng kwa tlasenyana go tswa mo rekotong.
But analysts expect GDP to have shrunk in the first quarter due to the hit to consumption from the second emergency curbs that rolled out in January and say a second consecutive contraction in Q2 that would constitute a recession is possible.	Ikonomi ya kwa Japan e neng e le mo maemong a a kwa tlase mo ngwageng o o fetileng, e kgonne go tlhatloga, re leboga thomelo e e maatla ya diromelwantle.
The timing is not good, as it would hit service spending during the spring leisure season, said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute, of the latest curbs.	Mme basekaseki ba solofela fa GDP e fokotsegile mo kotareng ya ntlha ka ntlha ya maemo a bobedi a tshoganyetso, a a simolotseng ka kgwedi ya Ferikgong mme a re fa go ka latela a bobedi mo kotareng ya bobedi, maemo a itsholelo a naga a tlaa ya kwa tlase thata.

Kgosigadi Elizabeth wa kwa Britain, Kgosigadi e e di fetang tsotlhe ka dingwaga, o tshwara dingwaga di le 95 ka Laboraro, mme ga go kitla go nna le mekete ya setšhaba e e tlaa latelang malatsi morago ga go boloka monna wa gagwe wa masome a dingwaga di le 7.
Because of COVID-19 restrictions, the queen sat alone during the sombre service for Philip, who she had described as her strength and stay.	Kgosana Phillip, yo Elizabeth a nyalaneng le ena ka ngwaga wa 1947, o tlhokafetse fa Moranang a tlhola malatsi a le 9, a na le dingwaga di le 99.
Elizabeth, who is also the world’s longest-reigning monarch, will be at the castle for her birthday, which traditionally passes off with little or no ceremony.	Segosi se file kgosi ya sona tlotla ya bona ya bofelo kwa phitlhong ya gagwe ka Lamatlhatso kwa Windsor Castle.
However, this year, with the royals marking two weeks of mourning, it will pass off with even less public show: there will be no gun salutes at the Tower of London nor the capital’s Hyde Park which usually occur on the queen’s birthday.	Ka ntlha ya dikgoreletsi tsa COVID-19, Kgosigadi e ne e ntse e le nosi na nako ya tirelo ya phitlho ya ga Philip, yo a mo tlhalositseng jaaka motho yo o neng a mo fa maatla.
The queen also has an official birthday, which is usually celebrated with greater pomp on the second Saturday in June.	Elizabeth, yo e leng kgosigadi e e busitseng nako e telele lefatshe ka bophara, o tlabo a le kwa ntlong ya gagwe ya segosi ka letsatsi la gagwe la matsalo, le le tlaa fetang fela kwa ntle ga gore go nne le moletlo.
Philips’s death has robbed Elizabeth of her closest and most trusted confidante, who had been beside her throughout her record-breaking 69-year reign.	Le gale monongwaga, jaaka segosi se na le dibeke di le pedi se le mo khutsafalong, le tlaa feta fela kwa ntle ga tlhagiso e kgolo go tswa mo setšhabeng: Ga go kitla go nna le moletlo wa dithunya tsa kakgolo kwa toreng ya kwa London kgotswa kwa motsengmogolo wa Hyde Park, o gantsi o diragalang ka letsatsi la botsalo la ga kgosigadi.
It also came just as she grappled with one of the gravest crises to hit the royal family in decades, allegations of racism and neglect by it from her grandson Prince Harry and Meghan, his American wife.	Kgosigadi e na gape le letsatsi la matsalo la semmuso, le gantsi le ketekiwang ka kgalalelo e kgolo ka Lamatlhatso wa bobedi wa Seetebosigo.
Newspapers have suggested that family members would be visiting the queen over the coming days to ensure she would not be left alone while mourning her late husband.	Loso lwa ga Phillip lo amogile Elizabeth motho yo o neng a mo tshepile thata, yo o neng a dula a mo tshegeditse dingwaga di le 69 tsa go busa ga gagwe.
A Buckingham Palace spokesperson declined to comment, saying all family matters after the funeral would be private.	Gape le tlile ka nako e a neng a mekamekana le bothata jo bogolo jo bo fetang mathata otlhe a a kileng a nna teng kwa lelapeng la bogosi mo dingwagasomeng tse di fetileng, ditatofatso tsa bosemorafe le go itlhokomolosa go tswa go setlogolwana sa gagwe, kgosana Harry le Meghan, mosadi wa gagwe kwa Amerika.
Elizabeth, who was born on April 21, 1926, in Bruton Street, central London, grew up not expecting to become queen.	Makwalodikgang a tshitsinya gore maloko a lelapa a tlaa etela kgosigadi mo malatsing a a tlang, go netefatsa gore ga a nne a le nosi fa a santse a le mo khutsafalong ya moswi mogatse.
Her father, George VI, only took the crown when his elder brother Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson.	Mmueledi wa ntlo ya segosi wa kwa Buckingham o ganne go tshwaela. A re merero yotlhe ya morago ga phitlho ga e kitla e buiwa mo pepeneneng.
She ascended to the throne in 1952 at the age of 25, and surpassed her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria as Britain’s longest reigning monarch in September 2015.	Elizabeth, yo o tshotsweng ka la 21 Moranang, ka ngwaga wa 1926, kwa mmileng wa Bruton, kwa bogareng jwa London, o godile a sa solofela go nna kgosigadi.
Elizabeth is also queen of 15 former British colonies including Canada, Australia and New Zealand.	Rraagwe, George VI, o tsere bogosi fela fa morwarraagwe yo mogolo, Edward VIII a ne a rola maikarabelo a gagwe ka ngwaga wa 1936 go ya go nyala mosadi wa kwa Amerika yo o neng a tswa mo lenyalong Wallis Simpson.
Protesting Free State artists have ended their 40-day sit-in at the Performing Arts Centre of the Free State in Bloemfontein after the appointment of interim acting CEO, Sharon Snell.	O tsere bogosi ka ngwaga wa 1952, a le dingwaga di le 25, mme o  fetile mmaagwemogologolwane, kgosigadi Victoria ka go nna kgosigadi e e busitseng nako e e telele go di feta tsotlhe kwa Britain ka Lwetse 2015.
Artists have been protesting against alleged corruption and mismanagement at the centre.	Kgosigadi Elizabeth gape ke kgosigadi ya maloba ya dikoloni di le 15 tsa kwa Britain, tse di akaretsang Canada, Australia le New Zealand.
They demanded the implementation of the 2018 Morar report, which implicated senior staff members at the Centre as well as a board member.	Batsweretshi ba kwa Foreisetata ba ba nang le dingongorego ba isitse kwa bokhutlong malatsi a le 40 a go dula kwa senthareng ya ditiragatso kwa Foreisetata, kwa Bloemfontein morago ga go tlhomiwa ga nama o sa tshwere wa nakwana, Sharon Snell.
They also wanted the sacking of the acting PACOFS CEO, Meshack Xaba, who is allegedly implicated in the investigation report.	Batsweretshi ba ne ba ngongorega kgatlhanong le bobodu le tsamaiso e e sokameng kwa senthareng.
Free State artists demand relief funds and an end to graft.	Ba gateletse topo ya bona ya go tsenngwa tirisong ga raporoto ya Morar ya 2018, e mo go yona go amegang maloko a badiri a a kwa godimo kwa senthareng ga mmogo le leloko la Boto.
The Free State Coordinator of the Cultural and Creative Industries Federation, Mbuyiselo Nqodi, says they welcome Snell’s appointment.	Ba ne ba batla gape le gore Mokhuduthamagamogolo wa nama o sa tshwere wa PACOFS, Meshack Xaba , yo o amegang mo raporotong ya patlisisong, a lelekiwe.
We will give the new CEO a chance to be able to settle in and be able to see what else she is going to do in terms of advancing what were complaining about.	Batsweretshi ba kwa Foreisetata ba lopa thuso ya matlole le gore megagaru e ye kwa bokhutlong.
But it is not entirely on her hands because this week we are getting a report from the Portfolio Committee on their visits and what and how they concluded with the institution on what to do.	Mookamedi wa kwa Foreisetata wa bokopano jwa setso le tsa botlhami, Mbuyiselo Nqodi a re ba amogetse go tlhomiwa gwa ga Snells.
But end of this week, we are going to get that report we understand that it going to be a long process the issue of the disciplining of Mr Xaba.	Re tlaa naya Mokhuduthamagamogolo yo mošwa tšhono ya go tsena mo tirong ya gagwe le go kgona go bona gore ke eng se a ka se dirang go tsweletsa pele dingongorego tsa rona.
In late March, the group had demanded decisive intervention from government.	Mme ga go mo diatleng tsa gagwe gotlhelele ka gonne mo bekeng e, re amogela pego go tswa go Komiti ya Photefolio ka ga diketelo tsa bona le gore ke tshwetso e fe e ba e tsereng le setheo ka se ba tshwanetseng go se dira.
On Sunday, the threatened to intensify their action until their demands are met.	Mme kwa bokhutlong jwa beke e, re tlile go fitlhelela raporoto eo. Re tlhaloganya gore tlha ya go kgalema Rre Xaba e tlile go nna thulaganyo e telele.
The Ditsobotla Local Municipality in Lichtenburg in the North West says it’ll step up security at the local cemetery, following the theft of a bust of Boer War General, Koos De La Rey, over the weekend.	Ka mafelo a kgwedi ya Mopitlwe, setlhopha se se gateletse topo ya tsereganyo  go tswa mo pusong.
Heritage Potchefstroom has raised serious concern about the theft.	Ka Sontaga, ba dirile matshosetsi a go atolosa kgato ya bona go fitlhelela ditlhokego tsa bona di amogelwa.
It is believed that the copper bust was stolen with the aim of melting it.	Mmasepala wa selegae wa Ditsobotla wa kwa Lichtenburg mo kgaolong ya Bokone Bophirima wa re o tlaa oketsa tshireletso kwa mabitleng a selegae go latela bogodu jwa sefikantswe sa tlhogo ya Ntwa ya Maburu Koos De la Rey, mo mafelong a beke.
De La Rey was a general during the second Anglo-Boer War and was shot and killed by police in September 1914, when they mistook him for a member of a criminal gang.	Ngwaoboswa ya Potchefstroom e kaile fa e tshwenyegile thata ka bogodu jo.
Heritage Potchefstoom Chairperson, Johan Wolfvaart, says incidents such as these lead to the erosion of the country’s history.	Go dumelwa gore sefikantswe se sa kopore se utswitswe ka maikaelelo a go se gakolosa.
It illustrates the narratives of South African history and of course the most important thing about it that we must learn from it.	De La Rey e ne e le mogenerale ka nako ya Ntwa ya Bobedi ya Maburu le Maesimane mme o ne thuntshiwa le go bolawa ke sepodisi ka kgwedi ya Lwetse, ka ngwaga wa 1914 fa ba ne ba akanya gore ke leloko la segongwana sa bosenyi.
So the loss of every heritage site or building is a complete lost to the people of South Africa basically.	Modulasetulo wa Ngwaoboswa ya kwa Potchefstroom Johan Wolfvaart, a re ditiragalo tse di jaaka tseno, di nyeletsa hisetori ya naga ya rona.
So that is why it must be preserved, explains Wolfvaart.	Di bontsha ditiragalo tsa hisetori ya Aforikaborwa mme selo sa botlhokwa thata ka ga tsona ke gore re tshwanetse go ithuta go tswa mo go tsona.
The Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurvereniginge(FAK) has indicated that they will sponsor a replica of the bust made from material that has no economic value.	Ka jalo, tatlhegelo ya lefelo lengwe le lengwe la ngwaoboswa ke tatlhegelo e kgolo thata go batho ba Aforikaborwa.
The CEO of FAK Dr Danie Langner says they will also assist to repair the grave.	Ka jalo, le tshwanetse go somarelwa, go tlhalosa Wolfvaart.
We will repair the grave with the replica of General De La Rey later this year with the help of Jack Miller, adds Langner.	Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurvereniginge (FAK) e kaile fa e tlaa fana ka sefikantswe se sengwe se se tshwanang le se, se se dirilweng ka didiriswa tse di senang boleng jwa ikonomi.
The Ditsobotla Local Municipality in Lichtenburg says it will ensure that the graves are fenced in order to curb theft and vandalism.	Mokhuduthamagamogolo wa FAK Ngaka Danie Langner, a re ba tlaa thusa le go baakanya lebitla.
Spokesperson Pius Batsile says they have never had security at the grave site as they’ve never had cases of vandalism before.	Re tlaa baakanya lebitla la ga Mogenerale De la Rey moragonyana monongwaga ka thuso ya ga Jack Miller, Langner o a oketsa.
There has been never a security at that grave side because we have not experienced any vandalism before.	Mmasepala wa selegae wa Ditsobotla kwa Lichtenburg wa re o tlaa netefatsa gore mabitla a a kampelwa go fokotsa bogodu le tshenyo.
That is why it has been a shortfall; actually an oversight from our side.	Mmueledi Pius Batsile a re ba ne ba se na tshireletso mo lefelong le ka ntlha ya fa ba ne ba ise ba itemogele dikgetse tsa bosenyi.
But moving forward, we are intending we are going to put proper security at that side, says Batsile.	Ga go ise go nne le tshireletso kwa mabitleng ka ntlha ya fa re ise re itemogele tshenyo epe.
North West police says no criminal case has been registered yet.	Ke ka moo e ntseng e tlhaela; tota tota ke go tlhoka tlhokomelo go tswa ka mo letlhakoreng la rona.

The Federation for Afrikaans Culture Organisations (FAK) is still hoping to find the bronze bust of Boer General Koos de la Rey.	Sepodise sa Bokone Bophirima sa re ga go na kgetse ya bosenyi e e setseng e kwadisitsweng.
The bust was stolen from his grave in the Lichtenburg cemetery, in the North West, at the weekend.	Pego ka Syllvester Serame.
The bronze bust of the iconic South African Boer War leader was made in 1917.	Mokgatlho wa Federation for Afrikaans Culture (FAK), o santse o na le tsholofelo ya gore o tlaa bona sefikantswe sa ga Mogenerale Koos De la Rey.
The grave was also vandalised.	Sefikantswe se se utswitswe kwa lebitleng la gagwe, kwa dirapeng tsa kwa Lichtenburg kwa Bokone Bophirima, ka mafelo a beke.
A case of theft and vandalism has been opened by the FAK.	Sefikantswe sa boronse sa mogaka wa Aforikaborwa wa Ntwa ya Maburu se dirilwe ka ngwaga wa 1917.
Project manager at the FAK, Johan Janse van Vuuren, says the loss of the bronze bust is a tragedy.	Lebitla le lona le sentswe.
He says they are visiting all scrap metal businesses in the area in an attempt to locate the stolen artefact.	Kgetse ya bogodu le bosenyi e butswe ke mokgatlho wa FAK.
Van Vuuren says even if they find the original bust, they have already commissioned an artist to make a replica from less valuable material to restore the grave.	Motsamaisa diporojeke kwa FAK, Johan Janse van Vuuren, a re tatlhegelo ya sefikantswe se sa boronse ke masetlapelo.
He says heritage sites are becoming targets for vandals.	A re ba tlaa etela dikgwebo tsotlhe tse di dirang ka ditshipi mo tikologong eo, ka maiteko a go bona gore a ba ka se bone sefikantswe se se utswitsweng se.
Afrikaners are quite angry at this stage.	Van Vuuren a re le fa ba ka bona sefikantswe se, ba setse ba thapile motaki yo o tlaa dirang sefikantswe se se tshwanang le se, ka tiriso ya didiriswa tsa boleng jo bo kwa tlase gore ba kgone go baakanya lebitla.
We are at a place where it’s a bad situation for us but we aren’t giving up.	A re mafelo a ngwaoboswa a setse a fetogile mafelo a borukutlhi.
We are going forward and if our heritage sites get vandalised we will make a plan to restore it.	MaAforikanere a galefile thata mo nakong e.
Anyone with information about the whereabouts of the bust are requested to contact the police.	Re a lemoga gore maemo a, a maswe mo go rona mme ga re kitla re ineela.
The involvement of women in traditional male circumcision is back in the spotlight.	Re gatela kwa pele mme fa mafelo a rona a ngwaoboswa a ka senngwa, re tla dira thulaganyo ya gore re a baakanye.
The protracted debate has been revived by the recently released book titled Zajik Izinto by author Siphokazi Vannessa Mpofu.	Mongwe le mongwe yo o nang le tshedimosetso ya gore sefikantswe se se ka bonwa kae, o kopiwa go ikgolaganya le sepodisi.
Mpofu believes the involvement of women in this rite of passage of Xhosa boys into men could save lives as some of the initiates die during this ritual.	Go nna le seabe ga basadi mo setsong sa banna sa bogwera go boetse gape mo pepeneng.
Every year, during the initiation season the Eastern Cape Province experiences deaths of initiates.	Ngangisano e, e tsoseleditswe bošwa ke go gololwa ga buka ya setlhogo se se reng Zajik Izinto, e e kwadilweng ke Siphokazi Vannessa Mpofu.
Mpofu says it is up to each generation to choose whether to build or destroy.	Mpofu o dumela gore go tsaya karolo ga basadi mo moetlong o wa fa basimane ba maXhosa ba fetoga go nna banna, go ka boloka matshelo ka ntlha ya fa bangwe ba  bagwerisiwa ba tlhokafalela kwa meetlong oo.
She maintains that women can play a crucial role in changing the status quo.	Ngwaga mongwe le mongwe, ka nako ya setlha sa bogwera, porofense ya Kapa Botlhaba e itemogela dintsho tsa bagwerisiwa.
I am a firstborn girl and a firstborn girl in our tradition is considered as a man, as someone who speaks and negotiates with his brothers.	Mpofu a re go mo diatleng tsa setšhaba go tlhopha gore a ba a aga kgotsa ba a senya.
Mpofu says the generational gap between parents and their children often leads to misunderstandings.	A o dumela gore basadi ba ka tshameka karolo e e botlhokwa mo go fetoleng maemo a ga jaana.
Somehow, we clash. Us and our children.	Ke ngwana wa ntlha wa mosetsana mme go ya ka setso sa rona, ngwana wa ntlha wa mosetsana o  tsewa jaaka monna, jaaka mongwe yo o buang le go buisana le bo morwarragwe.
We clash because of the times.	Mpofu a re phatlha ya dingwaga e e leng teng fa gare ga batsadi le bana ba bona go le gantsi e dira gore ba se tlhaloganyane sentle.
So, we need to communicate about things.	Ka dinako tse dingwe, re ga re dumalane. Rona le bana ba rona.
We need to sit down and understand each other as parents and the children of today for the generations to come.	Ga re dumalane ka ntlha ya dinako.
Whatever we are doing, we are doing to correct the things that we did not like that were done by our parents for the generations to come.	Ka jalo, re tlhoka go buisana ka ga dilo tse.
The idea of women becoming involved is gaining traction.	Re tshwanetse go nna fa fatshe le go tlhaloganyana jaaka batsadi le bana ba gompieno, re direla le ba ba latelang.
Cultural Activist, Mncedi Liwani says women have a significant role in traditional circumcision.	Sengwe le sengwe se re se dirang, re se direla go siamisa dilo tse re neng re sa di rate, tseo di neng di dirwa ke batsadi ba rona. Re direla ba ba santseng ba tla.
What we are accepting is the intervention of mothers that they must come to the fore and culturally, they have a responsibility, especially in the Xhosa culture.	Kakanyo ya gore basadi ba nne le seabe e simolola go nna tlhotlheletso.
They have a responsibility whilst they are growing these boys.	Molwela-setso, Mncedi Liwani a re, basadi ba na le seabe se se botlhokwa mo gwerisiweng ga setso.
They are giving them guidance for them to be proper men.	Se re se na go amogela ke tsereganyo ya bomme, ya gore ba tshwanetse go tla pele mme go ya ka setso, ba na le maikarabelo, segolobogolo ka setso sa maXhosa.
Now, if the women of this country could embrace their responsibility, first of becoming mothers to our boys, and we, as men, can take and teach them how to be good men, if ever we can do such, I think we will be in a good position to say, parents of our time have produced a good fabric of society.	Ba na le maikarabelo fa ba ntse ba godisa basimane ba.
Traditional leaders say women have always been part of this rite of passage, but with limitations.	Ba ba naya dikaelo tsa gore e nne banna ba ba maleba.
Chairperson of the Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders, Chief Langa Mavuso says, Mothers prepare boys for medical fitness of initiates, whether or not they do not have underlying diseases and so on, the beer is prepared by women, the diet for initiates is prepared by women and everything that would make sure that the boy becomes well, it is a woman that drives that, even the grass cutting for thatching the house is done by women.	Jaanong, fa basadi ba naga e ba ka amogela maikarabelo a bona, a ntlha e le a go nna bomme mo basimaneng ba rona, mme rona jaaka banna, re ba rute go nna banna ba ba siameng, fa re ka dira jalo, ke akanya gore re tla bo re le mo maemong a a botoka a gore re ka re, batsadi ba dinako tsa rona ba agile setšhaba se se siameng.
So, it is not correct to say women do not have a role in initiation.	Baeteledipele ba setso ba re basadi kgale ba simolotse go nna karolo ya moetlo, mme ka tsela e e lekanyeditsweng.
The pandemic is also creating difficulties with the custom.	Modulasetulo wa Ntlo ya Baeteledipele ba Setso kwa Kapa Botlhaba, Kgosi Langa Mavuso A re, bo mme ba baakanya basimane gore ba itekanele mo mebeleng, ba na le malwetse kgotsa ba sena ona. Bojalwa bo dirwa ke basadi, dijo tsa bagwerisiwa di rulaganngwa ke basadi, seo se ne se tlaa netefatsa gore ngwana wa mosimane o nna sentle, ke mosadi yo o tlhotlheletsang seo. Le go segiwa ga bojang jo bo rulelang ntlo, go dirwa ke basadi.
With the winter initiation season cancelled last year while the summer initiation season was suspended halfway due to a high infection rate among initiates in December, a decision is still to be made about the coming winter season.	Ka jalo, go fosagetse gore re re basadi ga ba na seabe mo thulaganyong ya bogwera.
Jose Maponyane, the centre manager of Boulders Mall in Midrand, says the incident of him arguing with a customer was taken out of context.	Leroborobo le lona le tlhola mathata mo moetlong o.
This was heard during a hearing at the CRL Commission, where Maponyane appeared to tell his side of the story, following a complaint by Ndebele activist, Thando Mahlangu.	Ka ntlha ya fa bogwera jo bo tsenang ka setlha sa mariga bo tlogetswe mo ngwageng o o fetileng, fa jo bo tsenang ka setlha sa selemo jona bo emisitswe nakwana ka ntlha ya seelo sa tshwaetso e e kwa godimo ya bagwerisiwa ka Sedimonthole, tshwetso e sa ntse e tlaa tsewa ka setlha se se latelang sa mariga.
In March, Maponyane allegedly forced Mahlangu to leave the mall for being dressed in traditional regalia.	Jose Maponyane, motsamaisi wa senthara ya Boulders kwa Midrand , a re tiragalo ya go ngangisana ga gagwe le modirisi ga e tsewa ka mokgwa o e diragetseng ka ona.
Mahlangu was inside a store at the mall when he was told that his dress code was inappropriate.	Kgang e, e utlwilwe ka nako ya theetso kwa khomišheneng ya CRL, koo Maponyane a tlhageletseng gona go bua letlhakore la gagwe la kgang, go latela ngongorego e e tlhagisitsweng ke molweladiphetogo wa Kwa Ndebele, Thando Mahlangu.
Maponyane was suspended shortly after a video of the altercation went viral on social media.	Ka kgwedi ya Mopitlwe, Maponyane o ile a pateletsa Mahlangu gore a tswe ka mmolo ka ntlha ya fa a ne a apere diaparo tsa setso.
The CRL Commission summoned Maponyane to allow him the opportunity to explain the sequence of events that occurred at the Boulders Mall on 24 March.	Mahlangu o ne a le ka mo gore ga lebenkele kwa mmolong fa a ne a bolelelwa gore moaparo wa gagwe ga o a lolama.
Maponyane told the commission that he apologised profusely for the incident, however, he feels that the incident was taken out of context when the argument got heated.	Maponyane o ne a emisiwa nakwana morago ga gore bidio e e bontshang kgotlhang e aname mo mafaratlhatlheng.
I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere apology to Mr Mahlangu with regard to the humiliation and pain and suffering occurred as a result of the incident that happened on the 24th.	Khomišhene ya CRL e biditse Maponyane go mo naya tshono ya go tlhalosa tatelano ya ditiragalo tse di diragetseng kwa mmolong wa Boulders ka di 24 tsa kgwedi ya Mopitlwe.
It’s unfortunate that the incident was misinterpreted as I had a cordial discussion with Mr Mahlangu before the video was taken, which was taken out of context.	Maponyane o boleletse Khomišhene gore o  ikopetse maitshwarelo ka tiragalo e, le fa go le jalo, o ne a ikutlwa ekete tiragalo e, e tserwe ka tsela e seng yona fa ngangisano ya bona e ne e ya magoletsana.
I deeply regret the incident except that the treatment of Mr Mahlangu was totally devoid of principles of human dignity and equality that underpins our constitution.	Ke rata go tsaya tšhono e go romela maitshwarelo a me kwa go Rre Mahlangu malebana le kutlobotlhoko le tshotlego e a itemogetseng yona ka ntlha ya tiragalo e e diragetseng ka di 24.
Maponyane says that prior to the video being taken, he had a cordial conversation with Mahlangu where he asked him to cover up more of his body because other customers were feeling uncomfortable around him.	Go a swabisa gore tiragalo e, ga e a tlhalosiwa ka tsela e e diragetseng ka yona gonne ke nnile le dipuisano le Rre Mahlangu pele ga kgatiso ya bidio e e tlhageletseng ka tsela e e seng yona.
He says Mahlangu then repeatedly refused to cover up his body and thats when he asked him to leave when the video was taken.	Ke ikotlhaela tiragalo e e diragatseng thata kwa ntle ga gore tshwaro ya ka Rre Mahlangu e ne e sena seriti sa botho le tekatekano e e tshegetsang Molaotheo wa rona.
The security came back to me and said, Sir, the gentleman refuses to cover and then I was obligated, as a centre manager, to go and address the situation.	Maponyane a re, pele ga go gatisiwa ga bidio e, o nnile le puisano e e siameng le Mahlangu fa a ne a mo kopa go fitlha dikarolo tse dingwe tsa mmele wa gagwe ka gonne badirisi ba bangwe ba ne ba ikutlwa ba sa phuthuloga gaufi le ene.
So, I went there and had a cordial discussion with Mr Mahlangu.	A re Mahlangu o ne a gana go fitlha dikarolo tse dingwe tsa mmele wa gagwe mme ke teng fa a mo kopileng teng gore a tsamaye fa bidio e ne e tsewa.
When I asked him to cover because this is a public space, he said no, I am not going to cover because it is my tradition and I said, but you are exposing your underwear and an argument ensued.	Mosireletsi o ne a boela kwa go nna mme a re, rra, Rre yo o gana go ikatega mme ke ne ka patelesega, jaaka ke le motsamaisi wa Senthara, go samagana le maemo.
I then said this is a public space and there are kids in the mall and people are already complaining and if you don’t want to, then I will have to ask security to escort you out.	Ka jalo, ke ne ka ya koo mme ka nna le dipuisano tse di siameng le Rre Mahlangu.
CRL Chairperson, Professor David Mosoma, says it pains him to have seen such a heated argument over traditional attire.	Fa ke ne ke mo kopa gore a ikatege ka ntlha ya fa a le mo lefelong la setšhaba, o rile nnyaa, ga ke kitla ke ikatega ka gonne se ke setso sa me, mme nna ka re, fela o tlhagisitse diaparo tsa gago tsa fa teng, ke fa ngangisano e simolotseng teng foo.
I sit here with a very painful heart because I would have expected this behaviour or this interaction not between people who themselves have suffered so much in the loss of their culture and their identity.	Ke ne ka re, lefelo le ke lefelo la setšhaba mme go na le bana mo mmolong o, gape batho le bona ba setse ba simolotse go ngongorega. Fa o sa batle, ke tlaa tshwanelwa ke go kopa mosireletsi a go ntshetse kwa ntle.
Mosoma says the commission will study all the evidence of the incident and then make remedial recommendations later in April.	Modulasetulo wa CRL, Moporofesara David Mosoma a re, go mo utlwisa botlhoko gore a bo a bone ngangisano e e tletseng tšhakgalo jalo ka ntlha ya diaparo tsa setso.

Crowds will return to Madrid’s Las Ventas bullring for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic next month for a charity bullfight to raise money for matadors left jobless by COVID-19, officials said on Saturday.	Mosoma a re, khomišhene e tlaa buisa bosupi jotlhe jwa tiragalo eo mme e dire dikatlenegiso kwa bofelong jwa kgwedi ya Moranang.
Almost all of Spain’s bullrings, or plazas, have remained closed for the last year due to lockdown restrictions plunging the controversial spectacle and its matadors into financial crisis.	Puisano ka ga go somarela le go itumelela setso sa Seaforika le hisetori.
A maximum of 6,000 people will be allowed in to watch the May 2 bullfight, Madrids regional government said.

But even before lockdown bans brought bullfighting to a virtual standstill, the traditional emblem of Spanish culture had been struggling for survival in recent years.	Dimaseke e tlaa nna patelesego mme dikgato tse di gagametseng tsa go katogana di tlaa tsenngwa tirisong kwa moletlong eno.
Attitudes towards bullfighting differ among Spaniards with some considering it an essential part of the culture while others say it is a cruel spectacle.

Meghan, the wife of Britain’s Prince Harry, will watch the funeral of Prince Philip at her home in California on Saturday after she was advised by her doctor not to travel while pregnant, a source familiar with the situation said.	UK e laela Kgosana Phillip kwa phitlhong.
Meghan will watch as Harry walks in procession behind the coffin of the 99-year-old husband of Queen Elizabeth and alongside other members of the royal family, including his father Prince Charles and brother Prince William.	Prince Phillip o tlhokafetse mo bekeng e e fetileng ka Labotlhano kwa ntlong ya segosi kwa Windsor, a na le kgosigadi mo letlhakoreng la gagwe.
The funeral, to be held at the St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle where Harry and Meghan married in 2018, will mark the first time the prince has met his family since the couple gave an explosive interview to Oprah Winfrey in March.	Meghan, mosadi wa ga kgosana Harry wa ko Britain, o tla lebelela phitlho ya ga Kgosana Phillip kwa legaeng la gagwe kwa California ka Lamatlhatso morago ga fa a eleditswe ke ngaka ya gagwe gore a seka a tsaya maeto ka ntlha ya fa a imile, motswedi o itse maemo a a rialo.

The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Meghan, known officially as the Duchess of Sussex, had hoped to attend the funeral	Phitlho e e tlaa tshwarwelwang kwa kerekeng ya St George kwa ntlong ya segosi kwa Windsor, kwa Harry le Meghan ba nyalaneng teng ka 2018, e tla nna  lwa ntlha kgosana e kopana le ba lelapa la gagwe morago ga gore ena le mogatse ba tshware dipotsolotso le Oprah Winfrey ka kgwedi ya Mopitlwe.

Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth, died last week aged 99 and his funeral will be held entirely at Windsor Castle on Saturday, with no public allowed.	Karata e ne e kwadilwe ka letsogo ke Meghan.
Although the event has been scaled down because of COVID-19 restrictions, many traditional elements will remain, with a military procession inside the castle and pallbearers from units with close links to Philip.	Fa lekase la ga kgosana Phillip le isiwa kwa kerekeng go ya go simolola tirelo ya phitlho ya gagwe, le tlaa tsewa ka sejanaga se se kgethegileng sa Land Rover, se kgosana e ya kwa Britain e nnileng le seabe mo go tlhamiweng ga sona.
However, in place of the usual hearse, Philip’s body will be taken from its current resting place to St Georges Chapel on a Land Rover Defender which has been modified to carry a coffin  in keeping with Philips original plans for the funeral.	Phillip, monna wa ga kgosigadi Elizabeth, o tlhokafaletse mo bekeng e e fetileng a le dingwaga di le 99 mme phitlho ya gagwe e tlaa tshwarelwa kwa ntlong ya segosi kwa Windsor ka Lamatlhatso, mme setšhaba ga se a letlelelwa.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson told parliament on Monday it was fitting that Philip would be taken to his final resting place on a Land Rover, with a long wheelbase and a capacious rear cabin, which the prince had helped design.	Le fa dilo tse dintsi tse di amang tirelo e di fokoditswe ka ntlha ya dikgoreletsi tsa COVID-19, dikarolo tse dintsi tsa setso di tlaa nna teng.

He died 20 years ago.	Sejanaga sa Jaguar Land Rover se tlaa dirisiwa go tsamaisa lekase la kgosana Phillip wa kwa Britain.
On 13 February 2001, the bodies of Molelekwa and his wife Florence Mtoba were found in an office which they shared in Johannesburg.	Moletsi wa piano wa mmino wa Jazz mo Aforikaborwa, Moses Taiwa Molelekwa, o ka bo a tshwere dingwaga di le 48 gompieno.
They had an eight-year-old son at the time.	O tlhokafetseng dingwaga di le 20 tse di fetileng.

It’s easy for people to say just find closure.	Ba ne ba na le morwa wa dingwaga di le robedi ka nako e.
It’s not a robot you know. Its emotions you know	Rraagwe, Jerry, a re o santse a retelelwa ke go lebala.
So, I still have a lot of questions and they’ve not been addressed even in the report.	Go bonolo mo bathong gore ba go reye ba re, lebala.
The conclusion is that he killed his wife and then killed himself, but I don’t see any substance to that.	Ga e se roboto wa itse. Ke maikutlo.
When I look at the report, it doesn’t state actually, just gives a statement but its not saying this is the object that was used, says Molelekwa.	Ka jalo ke sa ntse ke na le dipotso di le dintsi mme ga di ise di arabiwe mo raporotong.
A music academy has established in his honour.	Bokhutlo ke gore, o bolailwe mosadi wa gagwe mme a ipolaya, fela ga ke bone moko wa kgang eo.
Molelekwa played with the likes of the late Miriam Makeba and Jonas Gwangwa in the 1980s.	Fa ke lebelela raporoto e, ga e tlhalose tota tota, e neela polelo fela mme ga e kae gore sebetsa se se dirisitsweng ke se, go bua Molelekwa.
Molelekwa named Herbie Hancock, Bheki Mseleku and Abdullah Ibrahim as major influences on his music.	Akatemi ya mmino e tlhomilwe go mo tlotla.
Thembelihle Dunjana says Molelekwa’s music lives through young artists.	Molelekwa o ne a diragatsa le batho ba ba tshwanang le bo Miriam makeba le Jonas Gwangwa ka dingwaga tsa bo 1980.
Queen Elizabeth will bid a final farewell to Prince Philip, her husband of more than seven decades, at a ceremonial funeral on Saturday, with the nation set to fall silent to mark the passing of a pivotal figure in the British monarchy.	Molelekwa o kaile Herbie Hancock, Bheki Mseleku le Abdullah Ibrahim jaaka batho ba ba nnileng le tlhotlheletso e kgolo mo mminong wa gagwe.
There will be no public procession, all the congregation will wear masks, and the queen, who says the death has left a huge void, will sit alone.	Thembelihle Dunjana a re mmino wa ga Molelekwa o tshela mo bathong ba bašwa.
She’s the queen, she will behave with the extraordinary dignity and extraordinary courage that she always does.	Kgosigadi Elizabeth o tlaa laela kgosana Phillip la bofelo, monna wa gagwe wa masome a dingwaga a a fetang supa, kwa tirelo phitlhong ka Lamatlhatso, le setšhaba se tlaa nna le motsotso wa tidimalo go tlotla loso lwa motho yo o tlotlegileng mo mmusong wa bobusaesi wa kwa Britain.
And at the same time, she is saying farewell to someone to who she was married for 73 years, said Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who will help officiate at the service.	Ga go kitla go nna le mokoloko wa setšhaba, phuthego yotlhe e tlaa apara dimaseke mme Kgosigadi, yo o reng loso lo tlogetse phatlha e kgolo thata, o tlaa nna e le nosi.
He said he expected the funeral to resonate with the millions of people around the world who have lost loved ones during the pandemic.	Ke kgosigadi, o tlaa itshola ka seriti le bopelokgale jaaka a dira ka metlha.
I think there will be tears in many homes because other names will be on their minds, faces they’ve lost that they don’t see again, funerals they couldn’t go to as many haven’t been able to go to this one because it is limited to 30 in the congregation, he said.	Ka yona nako eo, o laela motho yo o neng a le mo lenyalong le ena dingwaga di le 73, go bua Justin Welby, Mobishopomogolo wa Canterbury, yo o tlaa thusang ka tsamaiso ya tirelo.
That will break many a heart.	O rile o solofetse fa phitlho e tlaa nyalelana le dimilione tsa batho go ralala lefatshe, ba ba latlhegetsweng ke batho ba ba ba ratang ka nako ya leroborobo.
He called on the British public to pray for the monarch.	Ke akanya gore go tla nna le dikeledi mo magaeng a le mantsi ka ntlha ya fa maina a mangwe a tlaa tla mo megopolong ya bona,  difatlhego tse di ba latlhegetseng tse ba sa tlholeng ba di bona, diphitlho tse ba paletsweng ke go ya kwa go tsona jaaka ba le bantsi ba paletswe ke go tla mo go e ka ntlha ya gore e lekanyeditswe phuthego ya batho ba le 30, a rialo.
Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, who had been by his wife’s side throughout her record-breaking 69-year reign, died peacefully at the age of 99 last week at the castle where the royal couple had been staying during a recent lockdown.	Seo se tlaa roba dipelo di le dintsi.
A decorated Royal Navy veteran of World War Two, his funeral, much of which was planned in meticulous detail by the prince himself, has a strong military feel, with personnel from across the armed forces playing prominent roles.	O ne a kopa setšhaba go rapelela bogosi.
Army bands, Navy pipers and Royal Marine buglers will take part, while his coffin will be conveyed from its resting place inside the castle to the chapel on the back of a specially-converted Land Rover that he helped design himself.	Phillip, kgosana ya kwa Edinburgh, yo o nnileng mo letlhakoreng la mosadi wa gagwe mo dingwageng di le 69 tsa puso, o tlhokafetse ka kagiso a le dingwaga di le 99 mo bekeng e e fetileng kwa ntlong ya segosi, kwa balekane ba ba neng ba nna teng ka nako ya kiletsomesepele.
At 1400 GMT, before the service starts, there will be a minutes silence.

The congregation will be limited to members of the royal family and Philips family, with no place for political figures such as Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who will watch the event on television where it will be broadcast live.	Masole a dibente le sesole sa kwa Lewatleng ba tlaa tsaya karolo, fa lekase la gagwe lona le tlaa tsewa go tloga kwa lefelong la lona la boikhutso ka mo teng ga ntlo ya segosi, go ya kwa kerekeng, le pegilwe mo godimo ga koloi e e kgethegileng ya Land Rover, e a nnileng le seabe mo go dirweng ga yona.
The entire event will be held within the walls of Windsor Castle and the public have been asked not to congregate outside or at any other royal residences to show their respects.	Ka 1400 GMT, pele a ga tirelo e simololaa, go tlaa nna le metsotso wa tidimalo.
With a reputation for a tough, no-nonsense attitude and a propensity for occasional gaffes, Philip was credited with helping his wife, who he married in 1947, modernise the monarchy in the changing post-war period, and to deal with the many crises that befell the institution.	Phuthego e tlaa bo e lekanyeditswe go maloko a lelapa le ba lelapa la ga Philip. Ga go kitla go nna le lefelo la bodulo la borradipolotiki ba ba tshwanang le Tonakgolo Boris Johnson, yo o tla lebelelang tirelo mo thelebišeneng, mo e tlabo e gasiwa teng.
Last month, the royals faced their greatest such tumult in decades when Prince Harry, grandson of Elizabeth and Philip, gave an explosive interview to Oprah Winfrey with his wife Meghan, who is not attending the funeral as she is heavily pregnant and was advised not to travel.	Tiragalo yotlhe e tlaa tshwarelwa ka fa gare ga dipota tsa ntlo ya segosi kwa Windsor mme setšhaba se kopilwe go se kgobokane kwa ntle kgotsa kwa dingwe tsa dikago tsa segosi go bontsha tlotlo.
This is a funeral.	Jaaka motho yo o neng a itsege a le bosilo ebile a tlotlegile thata, Phillip o ne a kaiwa fa a ne a thusa mosadi wa gagwe yo a mo nyetseng ka ngwaga wa 1947, ka go ntšhwafatsa bobusaesi morago ga nako ya dintwa, le samagana le mathata a mantsi a a tlhagileng kwa bogosing.
The arrangements have been agreed, and they represent her majesty’s wishes.	Mo kgweding e e fetileng, ba bogosi ba itemogetse mathata a mantsi a ba iseng ba itemogeleng  ona mo dingwagasomeng fa Kgosana Harry, setlogolo sa ga Elizabeth le Phillip, a ne a fana ka potsolotso go Oprah Winfrey le mosadi wa gagwe Meghan, yo a sa kgonang go nna teng kwa phitlhong ka ntlha ya fa imile e bile a eleditswe gore a se tseye maeto.
The palace has emphasised that while the occasion would have the due pageantry that marks the passing of a senior royal, it remained an occasion for a mourning family to mark the passing of a husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather.	Se ke phitlho.
The couples second son Prince Andrew has said his mother was being stoical in the face of a loss that she had described as having left a huge void in her life.	Dithulaganyo di dirilwe ka tumalano, mme di tsaisana le dikeletso tsa kgosana.
It’s a great loss, he said	Ba lefelo ba bogosi ba gateletse gore, le fa tirelo e nnile le susupo sa gore go tlhokafetse motho yo mogolo kwa bogosing, e nnile tirelo ya go fa ba lelapa nako go hutsafalela go tlhokafala ga ga Rre wa lelapa, rremogolo le rremogologolwana
I think the way I would put it is, we’ve lost almost the grandfather of the nation.	Morwa wa bobedi wa balekane ba, Kgosana Andrew o rile mmaagwe o ne a bontsha e motho o tiileng le fa a lebagane le tatlhegelo e a tlhalositseng fa e mo tlogetse ka phatlha e kgolo mo botshelong jwa gagwe.
Garrett Bradleys award-winning documentary Time may be about incarceration, but, according to the director, its really a love story.	Yona ke tatlhegelo e kgolo, a rialo
The Oscar-nominated film follows Fox Rich over several decades as she fights for her jailed husband Rob, serving a 60-year sentence for a bank robbery the couple carried out in the 1990s, to be released from prison in Louisiana.	Ke akanya gore tsela e nka e bayang ka yona ke gore, re latlhegetswe ke rremogolo wa setšhaba sotlhe.
I went into the project with the intention of extending the conversation around incarceration from a woman’s point of view, from a family’s point of view, Bradley told Reuters in an interview from California.	Dokumentari e e gapileng sekgele ya ga Garrett Bradley, Time, e ka tswa e bua ka botshelo jwa kwa kgolegelong, mme, go ya ka motsamaisi, yona tota ke kgang e e buang ka lorato.
I would say that Time is first and foremost a love story that’s rooted in Fox Rich, the family matriarch who dedicates 21 years of her life and her family’s life to re-uniting her family.	Filimi e e tlhophilweng go gapa sekgele sa Oscar e, e sala Fox Rich morago mo dingwagasomeng di le mmalwa fa a lwela  monna wa gagwe, yo a atlholetsweng dingwaga di le 60 kwa kgolegelong ka ntlha ya tsietso ya banka e balekane ba ba e dirileng ka dingwaga tsa bo 1990, gore a gololwe kwa kgolegelong ya kwa Louisiana.
Following a previous film on the same theme, Bradley began filming Time with Rich and her sons in 2017 with the aim of releasing a 13-minute short.	Ke ne ka tsena mo porojekeng ka maikaelelo a go atolosa dipuisano ka ga botshelo jwa kwa kgolegelong go tswa mo letlhakoreng la me jaaka motho wa mosadi. Bradley o boleletse Reuters mo dipotsolotsong kwa California.
On the last day, Rich, who served a three-and-a-half-year sentence for the robbery, gave her more than 100 hours of her own footage to use.	Ke tla re “Time” ke kgang ya lerato, e e ikaegileng mo go Fox Rich, motho wa lelapa yo o neelang ka dingwaga di le 21 tsa botshelo jwa gagwe le botshelo jwa lelapa la gagwe gore a kgone go kopanya ba lelapa la gagwe gape.
The result is old video diaries woven in with recent material, in which Rich is seen caring for her family over the years without her husband around.	Fa re latela filimi e e fitileng, e e nang le moono o o tshwanang le wa filimi e, Bradley simolotse go gatisa “Time” le Rich le basimane ba gagwe ka 2017 ka maikaelelo a go golola filimi ya bokhutshwane jwa metsotso e le 13.
I like to think that there isn’t anything in the film that doesn’t speak to love and to unity and self-definition, Bradley said.	Ka letsatsi la bofelo, Rich, yo o ntseng kwa kgolegelong dingwaga di le tharo le halofo ka ntlha ya borukhutlhi, o mo file kgatiso ya diura tse di fetang 100 gore a e dirise.
Facebook Incs independent oversight board said on Friday it had extended the timeline for deciding whether to uphold former US President Donald Trump’s indefinite suspension from Facebook and Instagram.	Dipholo tsa teng ke dibidio tsa kgale  tse di ntšhwafaditsweng, tse mo go tsona, Rich a bonwang a tlhokomela ba lelapa la gagwe mo dingwageng tse di fetileng kwa ntle ga monna wa gagwe.
The board, created by Facebook in response to criticism over its handling of problematic content, wrote in a tweet that it would announce the decision in the coming weeks.	Ke rata go akanya gore ga go sepe mo filiming e, se se sa bueng ka lorato le tshwaragano le go itlhalosa gore o mang. Bradley o buile jalo.
Facebook indefinitely blocked Trump’s access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts over concerns of further violent unrest following the January 6 storming of the US Capitol by his supporters.	Boto ya bookamedi e e ikemetseng ya Facebook e rile ka Labotlhano, e okeditse nako ya go swetsa gore a e tlaa tshegetsa go sekegiwa ga moporesidente wa maloba wa kwa US, Donald Trump kwa Facebook le Instagram kgotsa nnyaa.
It later handed the case to the board.	Boto e, e e tlhamilweng ke Facebook go tsibogela lenyatso ka ntlha ya mokgwa o ka ona ba tsamaisitseng dikgang tsa bona tse di bakang mathata, e kwadile Tweet e e tlhalosang gore ba tlaa tlhagisa tshwetso ya bona mo dikgweding tse di tlang.
The board, which would usually have 90 days to make a decision, had been expected to announce its ruling in the coming days.	Facebook e ile ya thibela Trump go dirisa diakhaonto tsa ga gagwe tsa Facebook le Instagram ka ntlha ya matshwenyego a tswelelo ya tirisodikgoka morago ga gore baemanokeng ba gagwe ba tlhasele US Capitol ka kgwedi ya Ferikgong.
But the board said its extension of the cases public comment period meant it needed more time to review the input.	E ne ya romela kgetse kwa botong morago ga nakwana.
The board has said it had received more than 9 000 comments on the Trump case, more than for any other case.	Boto e ka gale e nang le malatsi a le 90 go tsaya tshwetso, e ne e solofetswe go dira kitsiso ka ga katlholo ya yona mo malatsing a a tlang.

In terms of success, the EU has contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.	A mme e tla dira jalo?
It has also promoted economic convergence between its wealthier and poorer constituent parts.	Maitemogelo a AU a ka thusa go bontsha tsela e e yang kwa pele, ke kgonego e e tlaa nnang teng ya go se tswele pele.

In terms of pitfalls, the EU has seen its fair share of detractors and crises.	E tlhagisitse diphitlhelelo di le mmalwa go akaretsa seabe sa EU mo kitsisong ya temokerasi kwa Greece, Spain le Portugal, go gagamadiwa ga temokemisi kwa Botlha ba jwa Europe le go fenya kgaoganyo magareng ga Botlhaba le Bophirima ka bogare, ga mmogo le dikgotlhang tse di leng teng tsa bosetšhaba.

Sweden is facing an acute shortage of sperm for assisted pregnancy as would-be donors avoid hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic, halting inseminations in large parts of the healthcare system and driving up waiting times by years.	Sweden e lebane le tlhokego e kgolo ya peo ya bonna e e thusang bomme go ima jaaka baabi go tila maokelo mo leroborobong le la mogare wa corona, se se diegisa thulaganyo ya tsenngwa ga peo ya monna mosading, mo dikarolong tse dikgolo tsa tlhokomelo ya boitekanelo, mme se, se oketsa palo ya dingwaga tsa go leta.
We’re running out of sperm.	Re felelea ke peo ya bonna.
We’ve never had so few donors as during the last year, said Ann Thurin Kjellberg, head of the reproduction unit at Gothenburg’s University Hospital.	Re nnile le baabi ba le mmalwa thata mo tsamaong ya ngwaga o o fetileng, go bua Ann  Thurin Kjellberg , Tlhogo ya Yuniti ya go atisa kwa bookelong jwa University kwa Gothenburg.
The shortage has meant waiting times for assisted pregnancy have shot up from around six months to an estimated 30 months in the past year, possibly longer, doctors familiar with the matter told Reuters.	Tlhaelo e, e kaya gore dinako tsa go emela thuso ya ga ima di oketsegile, tloga ka go leta dikgwedi di le thataro go bokana ka dikgwedi di le 30 mo ngwageng o o fetileng, gongwe go feta, dingaka tse di itseng ka ga morero o di boleletse Reuters.
Its stressful that we can’t get a clear time or date for treatment, said Elin Bergsten, a 28-year-old maths teacher from southern Sweden.	Go a tlhobaetsa gore re be re sa kgone go bo nako e e siameng kgotsa letlha la kalafi, go bua Elin Bergsten, morutabana wa dipalo wa dingwaga di le 28 go tswa kwa Borwa jwa Sweden.
Two years ago, Bergsten and her husband learned he was unable to produce semen, and the pair immediately applied for assisted pregnancy.	Dingwaga di le pedi tse di fetileng, Bergsten le monna wa gagwe ba lemogile fa a kgone go a sa kgone go ntsha matute a bonna, mme bobedi jo jwa dira kopo ya go thusiwa ka go ima.
She was due to have her second cycle of insemination before her treatment was indefinitely delayed due to the shortage.	O ne a tshwanetse go ya kwa logatong lwa bobedi lwa kimiso ya gagwe pele ga ba itemogela tiego ka ntlha ya tlhaelo ya kalafi.
It’s a national phenomenon. Thurin Kjellberg said.	Ke bothata jwa bosetšhaba. Go bua Thurin Kjellberg.
We’ve run out in Gothenburg and Malmo, they will soon run out in Stockholm, she added, naming the three most populous areas of the country.	Re feletswe mo Gothenburg le Malmo, Stockholm le yona e tlile go felelwa e se kgale, a oketsa ka go umaka mafelo a le mararo a a itsegeng mo nageng.
Beyond public healthcare providers, there are also private clinics in Sweden which are able to circumvent shortages by buying sperm from abroad.	Go feta Batlamedi ba tlhokomelo ya boitekanelo, go na gape le ditleliniki tsa poraefete kwa Sweden tse di kgonang go thibela tlhaelo e ka go reka peo ya bonna go tswa kwa moseja wa mawatle.
But assisted pregnancy treatment there often costs as much as 100 000 Swedish crowns ($11 785), making it unaffordable for many.	Mme thuso ya boimana koo go le gantsi e tlhoka madi a a kana ka 100 000 Swedish crowns ($11 785),  e e dirang gore batho ba le bantsi ba palelwe ke go e fitlhelela.
Assisted pregnancy is free within Sweden’s national health service.	Thuso ya boimana ga e duelelwe kwa tirelong ya Bosetšhaba ya Boitekanelo kwa Sweden.
The Nordic countries and Belgium have the highest assisted conception rates in the world, in terms of availability of cycles per million of population, according to the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.	Dinaga tsa kwa Nordic le Belgium di na le kelo ya thuso ya boimana e e kwa godimo mo lefatsheng, go ya ka go nna teng ga ka dimilione tsa batho, go ya ka setsheo sa Setšhaba sa Human Reproduction le Embryology kwa Europe.
Under Swedish law, a sperm sample can only be used by a maximum of six women.	Ka fa tlase ga molao wa kwa Sweden, sampole ya peo ya bonna e ka dirisiwa fela ke basadi ba le barataro ka palo.
Most donated sperm in Sweden has reached this legal capacity, meaning that in many areas, assisted pregnancy is only available for women who have used a specific sperm sample before.	Bontsi jwa palo ya peo ya bonna e go neelanwang ka yona kwa Sweden e se setse e fitlheletse bokgoni jwa semolao, mo go rayang gore mo dikgaolong tse dintsi, thuso ya boimana e fitlhelwa fela ke basadi ba ba dirisitseng sampole e e rileng ya peo ya bonna mo nakong e e fetileng.
Margareta Kitlinski, who runs the reproduction unit at Skane University Hospital, the largest such clinic in Sweden, said it takes around eight months to process a donor due to the many tests involved, and that many samples fail to become viable donations due to common problems in freezing.	Margareta Kitlinski, yo o tsamaisang yuniti ya go atisiwa ga batho kwa bookelo jwa Unibesitithi kwa Skane, tleliniki ya mofuta o e e di fetang tsotlhe kwa Sweden, o rile go ka tsaya dikgwedi di le robedi go rulaganya moabi wa peo ya bonna ka ntlha ya diteko di le dintsi tse di dirwang, le gore disamopole di le dintsi di feleletsa di sa kgone go dirisiwa ka ntlha ya mathata a a tlwaelegileng a go gatsela.
If you have 50 men contact you, at best only half of them could be donors, Kitlinski said.	Fa o na le banna ba le 50 ba ba ikgolaganyang le wena, ke halofo fela ya bone e e ka kgonang go abelana ka peo ya bonna. Go bua Kitlinski.
Some Swedish regions have taken to social media to encourage potential male donors, but with varying results.	Dingwe tsa dikgaolo tsa kwa Sweden di tsene mo mafaratlhatlheng go rotloetsa banna go abelana ka peo ya bonna, mme dipholo tsa gona di a farologana.
In the meantime, the shortage lingers.	Mo nakong e, tlhaelo e a tswelela.
We need to go on TV and tell Swedish men to come forward, Thurin Kjellberg said.	Re tlhoka go ya kwa thelebišeneng go ya go bolelela banna ba mo Sweden gore ba iponagatse, Thurin Kjellberg a rialo.
The story of a Ndebele man clad in traditional regalia being asked to leave a mall has come full circle.	Kgang ya monna wa mo Ndebele yo o neng a kopiwa go tswa ka mmolo e bontsha e ya bokhutlong.
A video of his encounter at the mall went viral late last month.	Bidio ya tiragalo ya gagwe ya kwa mmolong e ne e aname mo inthaneteng mo kgweding e e fetileng.
The matter is now in front of the CRL Rights Commission, which has described the incident as a national crisis.	Morero o jaanong o beilwe fa pele ga Khomišhene ya Ditshwanelo ya CRL, e e tlhalositseng fa tiragalo e ama setšhaba sotlhe.
Thando Mahlangu was confronted by the Boulders Mall Centre Manager, Jose Maponyane, inside the Clicks Store and was told that the Ndebele traditional attire he was wearing was neither decent nor appropriate.	Thando Mahlangu o ne a tobiwa ke Molaodi wa kwa mmolong wa Boulders, Jose Maponyane ka fa gare ga lebenkele la Clicks mme a mmolelela gore diaparo tsa setso tsa seNdebele tse a di apereng ga di na seriti e bile ga di maleba.
Maponyane could be heard in the video saying he would not condone the outfit at in my mall.	Maponyane o utlwagetse mo bidiong a re, ga a kitla a letla moaparo wa mofuta oo mo mmolong wa gagwe.
Lets cut the long story short, we’ve got a right of admission.	Tlaa re kgaole kanelo e telele, re na le tshwanelo ya tsena.
I don’t condone this in my mall.	Ga ke letlelele se mo mmolong wa me.
So, ngicela uphume (please leave), Mapoyane could be heard saying.	Ka jalo ke kopa o tsamaye, Maponyane o utlwagetse a bua jalo.
Mahlangu was quick to remind Maponyane that his attire was African in Africa, to which Maponyane insisted that the attire was not descend in a public space.	Mahlangu o nnile bonako go gakolola Maponyane gore o apere moaparo wa Seaforika mo Aforika. Ke fa Maponyane a ka gatelela gore moaparo oo e ne e se wa go ka aparwa mo lefelong la batho botlhe.
The mall management has since said it regrets the humiliation suffered by Mahlangu and has since suspended the implicated centre manager.	Botsaimaisi jwa mmolo bo rile bo maswabi ka se se diragaletseng Mahlangu mme ba sekegile motsamaisi wa senthara e e amegang.
Saddest reality in Africa, I was subjected to inside the @Clicks_SA store at The Boulders Shopping Center.	Nnete e e botlhoko mo Aforikaborwa, e ke itemogetseng yona kwa gare ga lebenkele la Click kwa Mmolong wa Boulders .
Only because of the center manager, who said it was his shopping complex.	Ka ntlha fela ya motsamaisi yo o rileng ke mmolo wa gagwe.
I was told that I’m wearing inappropriate I must go & Omega risk solutions harassed me.	Ke ne ka bolelelwa gore moaparo wa me ga o a letlelesega mme ke tshwanetse go tsamaya. Omega risk solutions e ntshwere makgwakgwa.
The 35-year-old cultural activist says this wasn’t his first humiliation.	Molwelasetso wa dingwaga di le 35 a re, e ne e se lwantlha a itemogela nyenyefatso ya mofuta o.
The whole experience took me back to the incident that happened of a Gautrain.	Maitemogolo ao a mpuseditse morago kwa tiragalong e e diragetseng kwa Gautrain.
, I was once kicked out of a Gautrain, for wearing isiNdebele traditional attire and speaking in isiNdebele, for believing in isiNdebele.	Ke ne ka lelekiwa kwa Gautrain ka ntlha ya fa ke ne ke apere diaparo tsa setso tsa seNdebele, ke bua isiNdebele e bile ke dumela mo puong ya isiNdebele.
Redefine Properties, which owns the Boulders Mall in Midrand, says it has personally apologised to Mahlangu.	Redefine Properties, e e tshwereng mmolo wa Boulders kwa Midrand, ba re ba ikopetse maitshwarelo kwa go Mahlangu ka bobona.

Company CEO, Andrew Konig says they are conducting an internal investigation.	Moeteledipele wa setlamo, Andrew Konig a re ba ikaeletse go dira dipatlisiso mo teng ga setheo.
We deeply regret the incident and we have taken a lot of remedial action and this incident has held up a mirror for us to reflect on all our actions and our staffs actions.	Re ikwatlhaela tiragalo e thata mme re tsere dikgato di le dintsi go siamisa tiragalo eno. Tiragalo eno e re tshwaretse seipone se re tlaa itebang mo go sona, go bona maitshwaro a rona le a badiri ba rona.
We have publicly acknowledged that Redefine has distanced itself from the centre ‘managers actions and we do not condone what happened and we understand that Mr Mahlangu and his lady partner were treated inappropriately.	Re amogetse mo phatlalatseng gore Redefine e itlhaotse mo maitshwarong a motsamaisi mme ga re tsamaisane le se se diragetseng, e bile re tlhaloganya gore Rre Mahlangu le molekane wa gagwe ba ne ba tsholwa ka tsela e e sa amogelesegeng.
Konig said the Property group had also personally apologised to Thando Mahlangu as well as the Ndebele Council for the incident.	Konig o rile setlhopha se ikopetse maitshwarela kwa go Thando Mahlangu ka namana gammogo le Khansele ya seNdebele ka ga tiragalo e.
We have directly engaged with Mr Mahlangu and his advisors and Thursday was our last engagement with them and on Friday, a delegation of Redefine went to the royal council and we sat with the council and we humbled ourselves and paid deep respect to the Ndebele nation, as well as apologised for the incident at The Boulders.	Re ikgolagantse ka tlhamalalo le Rre Mahlangu le bagakolodi ba gagwe. Re buile le bona labofelo ka Labone mme ka Labotlhano, setlhopha sa kwa Redefine se ile kwa khanseleng ya morafe mme re ntse fa fatshe le Khansele, ka boikobo mme ra tlotla setšhaba sa maNdebele le go ikopela maitshwarelo ka tiragalo e e diragetseng kwa The Boulders.
We are happy to report that we left feeling that we achieved our objective to seek atonement for our actions.	Re itumelela go bega gore re tsamaile re na le  maikutlo a gore re fitlheletse maikaelelo a rona a go batla go lefisa melato ya diphoso tsa rona.
CRL Chairperson, Professor David Mosoma says the commission will speak to all the parties involved in the incident and then make remedial recommendations later this month.	Modulasetilo wa CRL, Moporofesara David Mosoma a re Khomišhene e tlaa buisana le botlhe ba ba amegang mo tiragalong eo mme e dire dikatlenegiso tsa go siamisa diphoso moragonyana mo kgweding eno.
The importance of this is to ensure that there is a cultural diverse appreciation of cultures and religions.	Botlhokwa jwa seno ke go netefatsa gore go na le kanaanelo ya ditso le ditumelo tse di farologaneng.

The event will also campaign for fair and equal access to vaccines for all.	Moletlo ono e tla nna le letsholo la phitlhelelo e e lekanang le e e siameng ya meento go botlhe.
The reality is that right now many of the wealthiest nations are starting to stockpile vaccines, said Evans, adding the broadcast would urge nations to donate excess doses and give financial support to the Covax facility, backed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI).	Nnete ke gore gona jaanong bontsi jwa dinaga tse di humileng di simolola go reka meento ka bontsi.

Colourful lanterns and ornate Ramadan decorations filled the streets of Jerusalem on Monday as Palestinians prepared for a holy month freer of COVID-19 restrictions than at the height of the pandemic.	Kgosana William le Kgosana Harry ba tlotla rremogolo wa bona.
Ahead of Ramadans expected start on Tuesday, the mood in the Old City was far more joyful than last year when prayers were suspended at the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islams third holiest site.	Mabone a a mebalabala le mekgabisa ya Ramadan, di ne di tladitse mebila ya Jerusalema ka Mosupologo fa Mapalesetina ba ne ba rulaganyetsa kgwedi e e boitshepo e e senang melawana ya thibelo ya COVID-19 gona le ka nako ya fa leroborobo le nele tseneletse thata.
Although Jerusalem is still without foreign tourists, far more people were roaming the Old City, where shops reported brisk business.

Because of coronavirus, the situation has been bad for the merchants and the people.	Le mororo Jerusalem e sa ntse e sena bajanala ba dinaga di sele, go na le batho ba le bantsi ba ba sasankang mo toropong ya Old City, kwa mabenkele a begileng gona gore kgwebo e a tsamaya.
Now with the coronavirus vaccination, the situation got better, said one shopper, Mohammad Abu Sbeih.	Ka ntlha ya mogare wa Corona, seemo se ntse se se sentle go barekisi le batho.
Israel has included Palestinians in East Jerusalem in its swift rollout of vaccines.	Jaanong ka ntlha ya moento wa mogare wa corona, maemo a botoka, Go bua mongwe wa bareki, Mohammad Abu Sbeih.
It annexed the eastern half of the city after capturing it along with the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war.	Iseraele e akareditse Mapalesetina kwa Botlhaba jwa Jerusalema mo tlhagisong ya yona ya meento .
But it is unclear if Palestinians from the occupied West Bank will be able to come to Al-Aqsa during Ramadan, as in previous years.	E mametleletse halofo ya toropo ya kwa botlhaba morago ga e go tshola mmogo le Banka ya kwa Bophirima ka ntwa ya kwa bogareng jwa botlhaba ka ngwaga wa  1967.
An Israeli military official said no decision had been made on holiday permits.	Ga go itsiwe gore a Mapalesetina go tswa kwa West Bank ba tlaa kgona go tla kwa Al-Aqsa ka nako ya Ramadan, jaaka mo dingwageng tse di fetileng.
The situation may be complicated by the far slower pace of vaccinations carried out by the Palestinian authorities than in Israel, which has faced international calls to ensure that Palestinians are inoculated.	Sesole sa semmuso ga Iseraele se rile ga go tshwetso e e dirilweng mo malatsing a boikhutso.
In the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Authority said it would allow more shops to open at night and for Ramadan night prayers to be held in mosques, except on the busiest day of the week, Friday, when they would take place outside.	Maemo a ka nna a tlhakatlhakanngwa ke bathati ba kwa Palesetina ka tsela e ba tsamaisang meento ka bonya ka teng gona le kwa Israel, e e lebaneng le megala go ya kwa dinageng di sele go netefatsa gore Mapalesetina a a entiwa.
But it imposed a COVID-19 night-time curfew on movements between cities, villages and refugee camps.	Kwa West Bank, baokamedi ba kwa Palesetina ba rile ba tlaa letla mabenkele a mangwe go bula bosigo le gore dithapelo tsa Ramadan di tshwarelwe kwa Mosques, ntle le ka letsatsi la beke le le nang le mekgape e mentsi, Labotlhano, kwa di tlaa diragalelang kwa ntle.
It also banned restaurants from holding iftars the breaking of the fast at sunset  and stores selling sweet pastries from opening their doors to customers, saying they could only make deliveries.	Mme e tsentse tirisong melawana ya metsao ya bosigo ya COVID-19 magareng ga ditoropokgolo, metse le dikampa.

Scrolling through the comments made on YouTube on Fela Anikulapo-Kutis music, one comes across remarks such as: The greatest unknown musician who ever lived, Why isn’t Fela’s music more widely known?	Batho ba batla go tlisa boitumelo mo magaeng a bona.
His music beats everything I’ve ever heard before and why am I so late to this?	Fa o lebeletse ditshwaelo tse di dirilweng mo YouTube ka ga mmino wa ga Fela Anikulap-Kutis, o tlaa fitlhela ditshwaelo tse di jaaka: Seopedi se se segolo se sa sa itsiweng, se se kileng sa tshela. Go reng mmino wa ga Fela o sa itsege thata?
The truth is that during Fela’s extraordinary lifetime, the Nigerians notoriety as an engaged citizen fighting for social justice was what usually attracted attention  and not his music .	Mmino wa gagwe o gaisa sengwe le sengwe se ke kileng ka se utlwa, le gona, goreng ke le thari jaana mo go se?
His public persona as a cultural renegade, an incorrigible iconoclast and social rebel hugged the headlines.	Nnete ke gore ka nako ya ga Fela ya botshelo, Go itsege ga MoNigeria yo jaaka moagi yo o neng a lwela bosiamisi jwa loago, ke sona se se neng se ngoka batho gantsi, e seng mmino wa gagwe.
Not his intoxicating blend of Yoruba trance music, highlife-derived harmonies and African American funk and jazz.	Maitshwaro a gagwe mo phatlalatseng jaaka motsuolodi wa tsa setso, ke ona a neng a tshwere ditlhogo tsa dikgang.
He was artistically ahead of his time.	Eseng mmino wa gagwe o o tlhakantseng mmino wa Seyoruba le mmino wa Jazz Seafrorika wa kwa Amerika.
And nearly 30 years since his passing, the world is still playing catch up.	O ne a le kwa pele thata fa go tliwa mo go tsa botsweretshi.
Fela was a social and cultural misfit during the prime years of his career.	Dingwaga tse di yang kwa go tse 30 fa e sale a tlhokafala, lefatshe le santse le leka go mo fitlhelela.
He was blacklisted on radio.	Fela e ne e le yo o nnisegeng mo tsa loago le setso  ka nako ya boiphediso jwa gagwe.
The DJs who played his records were considered brave.	O ne a phimotswe mo seyalemoweng.
These defiant on-air personalities included Lagos Jacob Akinyemi Johnson (JAJ), who broke the mould in the 1980s.	Bagasi ba ba neng ba tshameka direkoto tsa gagwe ba ne ba tsewa jaaka batho ba ba sebete.
It also didn’t help matters that Fela’s complex music compositions sometimes ran for over half an hour.	Bagasi ba ba neng ba roba molao ba, ba akaretsa Jacob Akinyemi Johnson (JAJ), yo o robileng molao ka dingwaga tsa bo 1980.
According to Fela, the value of music exceeded its entertainment appeal.	Se sengwe se se neng se sa thuse ke gore botlhami jwa mmino wa ga Fela ka dinako tse dingwe, o ne tshameka nako e e fetang halofo ya ura.
In his view, music had a spiritual dimension and so commercial considerations were secondary.	Go ya ka Fela, boleng jwa mmino bo ne feta mokgwa o o mmino o ne o bonagala ka teng mo go itumediseng batho.
As I wrote in a recent essay, his temperament was uncompromising.	Go ya ka kakanyo ya gagwe, mmino o ne o na le letlhakore la semowa, ka jalo, kgwebo e ne e latela mo logatong lwa bobedi.
Fela Kuti is one of many prominent names nominated for induction into the prestigious Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year.	Jaaka ke kwadileng mo tlhamong ya me ya sešheng, mekgwa ya gagwe e ne e tebile thata e bile e ka se fetoge.
Other big-name acts include Tina Turner, Foo Fighters and Iron Maiden.	Fela Kuti ke lengwe la maina a a itsegeng thata, a a tlhophilweng go tsenngwa mo “Hall of Fame” ya mmino wa Rock & Roll ngwaga ono.
We are already late in catching on during his colourful lifetime.	Maina a mangwe a magolo a akaretsa Tina Turner, Foo Fighters le Iron Maiden.
It does feel embarrassing.	Re setse re le kwa morago ga nako ka go fitlhelela ditiro tse a di dirileng ka nako ya gagwe e e itumedisang mo botshelong.
But now there’s an opportunity, with the benefit of hindsight, to revaluate, redefine and bestow his due accolades.	Go tlhabisa ditlhong.
Kuti’s recent nomination for a spot in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is a great start.	Mme jaanong go na le tšhono ya gore re ka boela kwa morago ra tlhalosa le go neelana ka dikabelo tsa gagwe tse di mo tshwanetseng.
The common mans middle finger	Tlhopho ya ga Kuti ya bošeng jaana ya go bona phatlha mo “Hall of Fame” ya mmino wa Rock & Roll ke tshimologo e ntle.
Fela was special and he stood out in his music, lifestyle and activism.	Monwana yo o mo magareng wa monna yo o tlwaeleging.
There he was, always uniquely dressed in embroidered brocades and African-inspired prints.	Fela e ne e le motho yo o kgethegileng seo se tlhageletse mo tirong ya gagwe ya mmino, mokgwa wa go tshela le bolweladiphetogo jwa gagwe.
Fela Kuti performed on stage with his band Egypt 80.	O kare ke a mmona, o ne a dula a apere diaparo tsa gagwe tse di kgabisitsweng ka mekgabisa ya Seaforika.
There was none like him then, and even now.	Fela Kuti o diragaditse mo seraleng le bente ya gagwe, Egypt 80.
Fela was an avatar, an anomaly and a pioneer all at once.	Ga go na ope yo o neng a tshwana le ena mo malobeng, le jaanong ga a yo.
And the ripples he left in his wake are still felt around the world.	Fela e ne e le motsayakarolo, motho yo o sa tlwaelegang le mothei wa dilo ka nako e le yosi.
Fela was difficult to love.	Mme diphetogo tse a di tlogetseng di santse di bonagala lefatshe ka bophara.
He always seemed too hot to handle.	Go ne go le boima go rata Fela .
He seemed out of place and was uncompromising in his art, politics and vision.	O ne ka gale a bonala e le motho yo o sa tshwaregeng bonolo.
He was wild, uncontrollable and spontaneous.	O ne a bontsha okare ga a a phuthologa mme a tebile mabapi le botsweretshi jwa gagwe, dipolotiki le pono.
This was a guy who had the sheer audacity to marry 27 women in a single day.	O ne a le tlhaga, a sa laolege mme a dira se a se akantseng, ka nako e a e akantseng.
He was accommodating to a fault.	Yo, ke monna yo o nnileng le sebete sa go nyala basadi ba le 27 mo letsatsing le le lengwe.
Hoodlums and common criminals were often able to seek and find refuge under his protection.	O ne a kgona go amogela phoso.
He found joy in poking at the finer sensibilities of decent society.	Disenyi tse di tlwaelegileng di ne di kgona go batla le go bona polokesego ka fa tlase ga tshireletso ya ya gagwe.
Fela was born middle-class, but on many occasions, he rejected classism.	O ne a bona Boitumelo mo go lekeng baagi ba setšhab ba ba nang le seriti.
He reportedly used luxury Mercedes Benz cars as transport for firewood, spinach and other indignities, to demystify affluence.	Fela o belegwe a itsholetse, mme mo mabakeng a mantsi, o ne a gana kgethololo.
Due to his behaviour, his music was shunned by polite society and the political class.	Go begwa fa a ne a dirisa dikoloi tsa monobonobo tsa Mercedes Benz jaaka dipalangwa go ya go batla dikgong, spinatšhe le tse dingwe, go bontsha fa khumo e se sepe.
Instead, he became famous for his serial transgressions, arrests, state-sanctioned physical assaults, 300 court appearances and spells of imprisonment.	Ka ntlha ya maitsholo a gagwe, mmino wa gagwe o ne o itlhokomolosiwa ke setšhaba se se maitseo le borradipolotiki.
He always referred to himself as abami eda, meaning the weird one.	Go na le moo, o ne a itsege ka melato ya gagwe, dikgolego, dikgwatiso tsa mmele, go tlhagelela kwa kgotlatshekelo makgetlho a le 300 le go tlhagisa metswedi ya kwa kgolegelong.
It was true.	O ne a tlhola a ipitsa ka abami eda, e e kayang “yo o sa tlwaelesegang”
He was as weird as they come, and wasn’t afraid to revel in it.	E ne e le nnete.
And now, his robust life has become myth.	O ne a sa tlwaelega e le tota e bile a sa tshabe go bontsha seo.
All we have left is a legacy of astonishing music.	Le jaanong, botshelo jwa gagwe o kare sengwe se se iseng se nne teng.
We must now develop the language and critical tools to describe and analyse the potency of his work.	Se re setseng ka sona fela ke boswa jwa mmino wa gagwe.
We must also begin to honour his music and cultural accomplishments.	Jaanong re tshwanetse go tlhama puo le didiriswa tse di leng botlhokwa go tlhalosa le go sekaseka tiro ya gagwe.
Fela’s Afrobeat’s legacy.	Gape re tshwanetse go simolola go tlotla mmino wa gagwe o le diphitlhelelo tsa gagwe tsa setso.
There are reservations about how appropriate Fela’s possible induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is.	Boswa jwa ga Fela jwa mmino.
He created a genre of music that defies standard systems of categorisation.	Go na le dipelaelo tsa gore go tsenngwa ga ga Fela kwa “Hall of Fame” ya mmino wa Rock & Rock go maleba go le kana kang.
It was the only way he could create art.	O tlhamile mofuta wa mmino o o nnileng kgatlhanong le tsamaiso e e tlwaelegileng.
A tricky legacy.	E ne e le mokgwa o le mongwe fela o a ka diramg botsweretshi ka ona.
It comprises a seductive fusion of diverse musical genres, politics, pan-Africanism, eroticism and funky, spirited grooves and attitudes.	Boswa jo bo gakang.
You cannot separate one from the other.	E le mefuta e e farologaneng ya mmino le motswako o o sa tlwaelegang, dipolotiki, mmoni wa Seaforika, dipina tsa semowa le maikutlo.
And that is why his fans and imitators can only come up with a shallower, globally acclaimed subgenre  Afrobeats.	O ka se di aroganye.

A Kimberley woman, in the Northern Cape, has started a project dubbed Beanies for KH.	Seo se nkutlwisa botlhoko le go feta.
The project knits beanies, booties and blankets for premature babies born at Robert Sobukwe Hospital.	Mosadi wa kwa Kimberley kwa Kapa Bokone, o simolotse porojeke e e bidiwang Beanies for KH.
Due to its success, orphanages, and social service centres are also now benefiting.	Porojeke e, e loga ditlhoro, ditlhako le dikobo tsa bana ba ba belegweng pele ga nako kwa bookelong jwa Robert Sobukwe.
Judi Jooste’s friend started the project to suppress her cigarette cravings, by knitting.	Ka ntlha ya katlego ya yona, magae a dikhutsana le ditirelo tsa loago le bona e ba tswetse mosola.
In no time she had stacks of little beanies and jerseys for premature babies.	Tsala ya ga Judi Joostes o simolotse porojeke go itebatsa ka keletso ya gagwe ya sekerete, ka go loga.
Ten years later, the project has grown and is now donating toiletry packs to mothers.	Mo nakong e se kae, ke fa a setse a kgobokantse dijeresi le ditlhoronyana tsa bana ba ba belegweng pele ga nako.
When you have a premature baby, you don’t know in advance that you’re going to be in hospital for up to three months.	Morago ga dingwaga di le lesome, porojeke e setse e godile mme jaanong e abelana ka dipakete tsa didiriswa tsa go tlhapa go bomme.
They run out of toiletries, out of everything.	Fa o na le ngwana le yo o belegweng pele ga nako, ga o itse go sa le gale gore o tlile go nna kwa bookelong dikgwedi tse fitlhang go di le tharo.
Then we started asking TJE communities for donations of toiletries to make up a little package consisting of basic things like things that we take for granted, deodorants, the toothbrush.	Ba felela ke didiriswa tsa go tlhapa. Ba felelwa ke sengwe le sengwe.
We don’t think about those but when you are in hospital, especially now in COVID times, no one can come and visit you.	Morago ga moo re ne ra simolola go kopa baagi ba TJE go abelana ka didiriswa tsa go tlhapa, go dira pakete e le nnye e e tsentseng dilwana tse re sa di tseyeng tsia jaaka ditlolo le maratšhe a go tlhapa meno.
They can’t bring you this stuff and you can’t even go out for basic things that will make your life easier, says Jooste who is leading the project.	Ga re akanye ka dilo tseo, fela fa o le kwa bookelong, segolobogolo jaanong ka nako ya COVID, ga go ope yo o ka kgonang go tla go go etela.
Jooste says old-age homes around Kimberley have joined hands with her.	Ba ka se kgone go go tlisetsa dilo tse, mme le wena o ka se kgone go tswa o ya go reka ditlhokego tse di ka dirang botshelo jwa gago bonolo, Go bua Jooste yo o eteletseng porojeke pele.
Elderly women knit these little jerseys and blankets for leisure, but wool is in short supply.	Jooste a re magae a bagodi mo Kimberley ba thusana le ena.
There were ladies who started knitting projects in the old age homes.	Basadi ba ba godileng ba loga dijeresi le dikobo tse di nnye tse ka nako ya bona ya maitiso, fela kgwele ya go loga e a tlhaela.
They realise that if they bring those ladies out of their rooms to sit in a lounge and to be social, they become much brighter, much more involved and happier.	Go ne go na le bomme ba ba simolotseng diporojeke tsa go loga mo magaeng a batsofe.
So then, we started asking for wool and that is, at this stage also, a big need, a ball of wool, explains Jooste.	Ba lemoga gorego ntsha bomme ba mo diphaposing tsa bona, go nna mo phaposing ya bonno le ba bangwe, go dira gore ba kgone go tsaya karolo mme ba lebega ba itumetse.
Apart from clothing premature babies, the project also donates knitted dolls to Robert Sobukwe’s oncology childrens ward.	Ka jalo, re simolotse go kopa kgwele ya go loga, e mo kgatong e, e leng tlhokego e kgolo thata. Go  tlhalosa Jooste.
Report by Motlalepule Morake:	Kwa ntle ga go apesa masea a a bonweng pele ga nako, porojeke eno gape e abelana ka dimpopi tse di logilweng kwa wateng ya bana ya kankere kwa bookelong jwa Robert Sobukwe.
Beanies for KH is an initiative aimed at helping premature babies.	Pegelo ka Motlalepule Morake: Beanies for KH ke letsholo le le thusang bana ba ba bonweng pele ga nako.

Last year, he sold Swift’s master recordings to a private equity company in a deal reported to be worth more than $300 million.	Mo ngwageng o o fetileng, o rekisitse swifts Masetase ya ga Swift go setlamo sa poraefete mo tumalanong e e begilweng e le ya dimilione tsa didolara tse di fetang 300.
Swift released Fearless as an 18-year-old and the album, her second, catapulted her to global stardom as well as winning her the coveted album of the year award at the Grammys.	Swift golotse alebamo ya Fearless fa a ne a le dingwaga di le 18, e leng ya gagwe wa bobedi, e e mo dirileng naledi ya lefatshe mmogo le go mo dira mofenyi wa sekgele sa alebamo ya ngwaga kwa dikabelong tsa Grammy.
Critics said her fans would be pleased with the re-recording, with the singer staying loyal to the original version 13 years on.	Basekaseki ba rile balatedi ba gagwe ba tlaa itumelela kgatiso e nngwe gape, fa seopedi se bontshitse go ikanyega go rekoto ya pele, morago ga dingwaga di le 13.
Music website NME said the re-recording celebrates and stays true to Swifts Fearless-era.	Webosaete ya mmino NME ya re, kgatiso e e keteka le go nna nnete mo go Swift ka dinako tsa gagwe tsa Fearless.
Production here is crisper and warmer than that of the original, and Swifts vocals are, understandably, more mature, it wrote.	Ntshokuno fano e monatšana e bile e bothitonyana go feta ya pele, lentswe la ga Swift le lona, mo go tlhaloganyesegang, le utlwa e le la motho yo godileng. E kwadile jalo
Listening back to the whole album has a similar effect to reading back an old diary especially as these songs are steeped in nostalgia given the prominence on first release.	Go boela kwa morago o reetsa alebamo yotlhe, go tshwana fela le go boela kwa morago o ya go buisa bukatsatsi ga bogologolo, segolobogolo ka gore dipina tse di baka tlhologelelo ka ntlha ya tuma ga tsona mo kgololong ya tsona ya ntlha.
The archbishop of Chiles capital Santiago, Celestino Aos, has been hospitalised after testing positive for the coronavirus, the Roman Catholic Church in Chile wrote in a statement posted on Twitter on Saturday.	Mobišhopo wa Chiles capital Santiago, Celestino Aos, o amogetswe kwa bookelong morago ga gore diteko tsa gagwe tsa mogare wa corona di bontshe fa a tshwaetsegile. Kereke ya Roman Catholic kwa Chile e kwadile mo setatamenteng se se phasaladitsweng mo Twitter ka Lamatlhatso.
Aos, 76, and Monsignor Alberto Lorenzelli, the auxiliary bishop of Santiago, were confirmed by the church as having tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this week.	Aos wa dingwaga di le 76, le Monsignor Alberto Lorenzelli, Mobišhopo wa kwa Santiago, go netefaditswe kwa kerekeng fa ba tshwaeditswe ke COVID-19 go sa le gale mo bekeng e.
Both had received two doses of the Sinovac vaccine being administered by the Chilean health authorities, the church said, with the second dose administered on March 11.	Bobedi jwa bona bo ne bo filwe moento wa Sinovac o o tsamaisiwang ke bothati jwa boitekanelo jwa Chilean. Kereke e buile jalo, mme moento wa bobedi o tlaa tsamaisiwa ka la 11 Mopitlwe.
The church said in its Saturday statement that Aos was admitted to a university hospital in the capital on medical advice and in a preventive manner.	Kereke e buile mo setatamente sa yona sa Lamatlhatso gore, Aos o amogetswe kwa bookelong jwa Yunibesithi kwa khepetleleng go bona kgakololo ya bongaka le ditsela tsa thibelo.
Although the effects of the disease are moderate, they need to be addressed with specialised equipment to avoid possible complications, the statement said, adding that Lorenzelli’s condition had not changed.	Le fa ditlamorago tsa bolwetse e se tse di masisi go le kalo, di tlhoka go rarabololwa ka didiriswa tse di marara go tila kgonego ya tlhakatlhakano, setatamente se kaile jalo, se tlaleletsa ka gore maemo a ga Lorenzelli ga a ise a fetoge.
A recent study by the University of Chile of national vaccination data and contagion rates suggested that the Sinovac vaccine was 54% effective at preventing coronavirus contagion two weeks after two doses are administered.	Patlisiso ya bošeng jaana ya Yunibesithi ya Chile ya tshedimosetso ya meento ya Bosetšhaba le kelo ya tshwaetsego, e tshitshintse gore moento wa Sinovac o na diperesente di le 54 tsa bokgoni jwa go thibela tshwaetsego ya mogare wa corona dibeke di le pedi moraga ga go tswewa ga meento e mebedi.
A broader, real-world study of the efficacy of the Sinovac and Pfizer vaccines being administered in Chiles rapid mass vaccination campaign will be published in the coming week by the government.	Thuto e e akaretsang ya lefatshe, ya katlego ya tsamaiso ya letsholo la meento ya Sinovac le Pfizer kwa Chiles, e tlaa phasaladiwa ke puso mo bekeng e e tlang.
Aos, who is from Spain, was appointed Santiago’s archbishop by Pope Francis in December 2019 as the Vatican sought to turn the page on a sexual abuse scandal that has shaken its standing and eroded support in the conservative Latin American nation.	Aos, yo o tswang kwa Spain, o ne a tlhomiwa jaaka Mobišhopo wa kwa Santiago ke Mopapa Francis ka Sedimonthole ka 2019 jaaka kereke e ne e batla go fetola tsebe mo morerong  wa tshotlako ya thobalano e e tsikintseng kemo ya yona le go latlhegelwa ke baema nokeng mo setšhabeng sa ma Latin a kwa Amerika.
Aos’s predecessor, Cardinal Ricardo Ezzati, faces multiple charges that he helped cover up sexual abuse of children by Chilean clergymen.	Mobišhopo yo o neng a tshwere pela ga Aos, e leng Ricardo Ezzati, o lebagane le ditatofatso di le dintsi tsa go leka thusa bipa thotlako ya bana ya thobalano e e dirilweng ke banna ba kwa Chilean.
He denies the charges.	O ganetsana le ditatofatso.
South Africa’s largest urban nature reserve, the Rietvlei Nature Reserve, discovered a new born rhino calf this past week.	Resefe ya Aforikaborwa e kgolo ya tlhago ya metsesetoropo, The Rietvlei Nature Reserve, e lemogile namane ya tshukudu e tshotsweng mo bekeng e e fetileng.
The reserve is ecstatic over its new discovery.	Resefe e itumeletse thibololo e ntšhwa e thata.
Rhinos are endangered in South Africa because of obviously poaching.	Matshelo a ditshukudu a mo kotsing mo Aforikaborwa ka ntlha ya batho ba ba di tsomang.
So its very good that they are breeding.	Ka jalo go go ntle thata gore di a tsala.
You know rhinos breed every three years.	O a itse gore tshukudi e tsala gagwe mo dingwageng di le tharo.
The mother would have a calf maybe every three years and then shell chase the old baby away, then shell have a new baby. So they don’t breed like every year.	Mme o tlaa nna le namane gongwe gangwe mo dingwageng di le tharo mme o tlaa leleka ngwana yo mogolo, mme a nne le lesea le lešwa ka jalo ga di tsale ngwaga le ngwaga.
So it takes long for them to have calves, so its very important, says Conservationist, Jeanri Weidenman.	Ka jalo, go tsaya nako e e telele gore di tsale dinamane, mme go botlhokwa thata, go bua Jeanri Weidenman.
The calf’s gender is yet to be determined as its mother is still overprotective.	Bong jwa namane bo santse bo tlaa tlhomamisiwa ka ntlha ya fa mme wa yona a santse a e sireleditse thata.
As soon as that mother is not overprotective anymore, she will come out with that calf into the areas.	Fa mme wa yona a sa tlhole a e sireleditse thata, o tlaa tswela le namane kwa mafelong a mangwe.
But people are really driving into Rietvlei, seeing all the different rhinos and the species that we’ve got here, says Environment and Agriculture MMC, Dana Wanenburg.	Mme batho ba a eta mo Rietvlei, ba bona ditshukudu tsotlhe tse di farologaneng le mefuta e mengwe ya diphologolo tse re nang le tsona fa. Go bua MMC wa tsa tikologo le temothuo, Dana Wanenburg.
Despite interruptions by COVID-19 in 2020, 394 rhinos were still poached.	Le fa go nnile le tsenogare ya COVID-19 ka 2020, ditshukudi di le 394 di santse di bolaiwe ke batsumi.
This is, however, a sharp decline in poaching, the lowest in 10 years, according to the Department of Environment Forestry and Fisheries 2020 Rhino Poaching Report.	Le fa go le jalo, se ke phokotso e e kgolo mo go tsumiweng ga ditshukudu, palo e e kwa  thata mo dingwageng di le 10, go ya ka raporoto ya Lefapha la tikologo ya Dikgwa le Bodirelatlhapi ya ngwaga wa 2020.
The Rietvlei Nature Reserve only had one encounter with poachers back in 2018.	Resefe ya tlhago ya kwa Rietvlei e nnile le maitemogelo a le mangwe fela le batsumi ba ditshukudu la 2018.
As a precautionary measure, they dehorn their rhinos.	Jaaka kgato ya thibelo, ba ntsha ditshukudu tsa bona dinaka.
We haven’t had any incident in the past two years with poaching.	Ga re ise re itemogelo go tsomiwa ga ditshukudo mo dingwageng tse pedi tse di fetileng.
We’ve been very lucky.	Re nnile lesego thata.
We’ve been dehorning the rhinos and we’ve been upping our security as well, explains Weidenman.	Re ntse re tlosa ditshukudu dinaka mme gape re ntse re gagamatsa tshireletsego ya rona, go tlhalosa Weidenman.
Visitor numbers at the reserve remain limited due to COVID-19 regulations.	Palo ya baeng kwa resefeng e a lekanyediwa ka ntlha ya melawana ya COVID-19.
Britain’s Prince Charles paid a personal tribute on Saturday to his dear papa Prince Philip, saying the royal family missed him enormously and that the 99-year-old would have been amazed at the touching reaction across the world to his death.	Kgosana ya kwa Britain, Charles o file rraagwe yo o rategang, Kgosana Phillip tlotla ka Lamatlhatso. A re ba lelapa la bogosi ba mo tlhologeletswe thata le gore rre yo wa dingwaga di le 99, o kabo a gakgamaditswe ke mokgwa o lefatsheng lotlhe le tsibogetseng loso lwa gagwe ka teng.

Charles, morwa yo mogolo le mojaboswa wa balekane ba, o buile jalo kwa ntle ga legae la gagwe kwa Highgrove, kwa Bophirima jwa England.
My dear papa was a very special person who I think above all else would have been amazed by the reaction and the touching things that have been said about him and from that point of view we are, my family, deeply grateful for all that.	Rre wa me yo o rategang e ne e le motho yo o kgethegileng, yo ke akanyang gore gareng ga dilo tshotlhe, o kabo a gakgamaditswe ke ke tsibogo ya batho le dilo tse dintle tse di builweng ka ga ene, mme mo ntlheng eo, re le ba lelapa, re lebogela tsotlhe tse.

Bustling New York City may not seem a bee-friendly place, but its high-rise rooftops and tiny gardens are buzzing with honey makers threatened by pesticides in rural areas.	Toropokgolo ya New York e ka tswa e sa bontshe e le toropo e e ratang dinotshe, mme dikago tsa teng tse di kwa godimo le ditshimo tse dinnye di tletse ka badiri ba mamepe ba ba tlhaselwang ke dibolayadisenyi mo mafelong a magae.
About 2.4 million Italian honeybees waited in a white van to be taken to their new homes early Friday.	Dimilione di ka nna 2.4 tsa dinotshe tsa mamepe tsa kwa Italy, di ne di letile mo koloing e tshweu go isiwa kwa magaeng a tsona a mašwa go sale gale ka  Labotlhano.
It was parked near the Dakota Apartments by Central Park, where John Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono has lived since 1973.	E ne e eme gaufi le dikago tsa Dakota kwa Central Park, kwa motlholagadi wa ga John Lennon, Yoko Ono, o ntse a dula teng fa e sale ka ngwaga wa 1973.
This is the first year that we’ve done this outside The Dakota, said Andrew Cot, president of the New York City Beekeepers Association.	Ono ke ngwaga wa ntlha re dira seno kwa ntle ga Dakota, go bua Andrew Cot, Moporesidente wa mokgatlho wa dinotshe wa kwa toropokgolo ya New York.
We heard that Yoko likes honey.	Re utlwile gore Yoko o rata mamepe.
Cot, who founded Andrews Honey, drove up from Georgia to deliver the bees.	Cot, yo o simolotseng “Andrew’s Honey”, o kgweeditse go tswa kwa Georgia a isa dinotshe.
The van held 200 wood and screen packages, each with about 12 000 bees.	Koloi e ne e pegile dikgong le dipakete tsa sekereni di le 200, nngwe le e nngwe ya tsona e tshwere dinotshe di le 12 000.
A steady stream of beekeepers lined up to pick up their 3 lb packages which cost $159 or $205, depending on when they placed their order.	Bontsi jwa batshwara dinotshe ba ne ba letile go bona diphuthelwana tsa bona tsa boleng jwa didolara di le 159 kgotsa 205, go ya fela ka gore ba tsentse kopa ya bona leng.
Bees are sold by weight, like cheese, he said.	Dinotshe di rekisiwang ka boima, jaaka kase, o buile jalo.
Some buyers stuffed the packages in bags, while Ray Sage strapped two boxes of bees to his bicycle to ride to his hive on the Lower East Side.	Bangwe ba bareki ba tsentse diphuthelwana tsa bona mo dikgetseng, fa Ray Sage ena a ne a gokelela mabokoso a mabedi a dinotshe mo baesekeleng ya gagwe go ya kwa mosimeng wa gagwe kwa Botlhaba.
I have to just ride really slowly and carefully.	Ke tshwanetse go kgweetsa  fela ka iketlo le ka kelotlhoko.
Sometimes I think of it as I’m training to be Danish and I never become Danish, he said.	Ka dinako tse dingwe ke akanya ka yona jaaka e kete ke ikatisetsa go nna Danish, mme ga nke ke nna Danish, a rialo.
The number of urban beekeepers has grown quickly, with many hives now found on the rooftops of skyscrapers and office buildings, Cote said.	Palo ya batshwara dinotshe ba kwa metsesetoropong e oketsegile ka bonako, ka ditshimo tse di ntsi tsa dinotshe tse di bonwang kwa dikagong tse di kwa godimo le kwa dikagong tsa dikantoro, Cote o buile jalo.
New York legalised beekeeping in 2010 and has hundreds of registered hives, according to the Department of Health.	New York e letleletse go tshwarwa ga dinotshe go nna mo molaong ka 2010 mme e na le makgolo a mesima e e kwadisitsweng go ya ka Lefapha la Boitekanelo.
Bee populations are in sharp decline worldwide, partly because of excessive pesticides and chemicals in rural areas, and a lack of crop variety.	Dipalo tsa dinotshe di a fokotsega mo lefatsheng ka bophara, ka ntlha ya go gasiwa ga dibolayadisenyi le dikhemikhale mo mafelong a magae, le tlhokego ya dijalo tse di farologaneng.
New York does not have this problem, making it a healthy bee habitat, said Alan Markowitz, a Bronx resident who is a beekeeper at La Finca del Sur Community Garden, run by women of colour.	New York ga e na bothata jo, se se e dira lefelo le le  itekanetseng la manno a dinotshe, go bua Alan Markowitz, yo e leng moagi wa kwa Bronx e bile e le motshwara dinotshe kwa tshingwaneng ya baagi kwa La Finca del Sur, e e  tsamaiswang ke basadi ba mmala.
A third of what you put in your mouth needs a pollinator.	Nngwetharong ya se o se tsenyang mo molomong wa gago e tlhoka mmudula peo.
And in the city, believe it or not, bees do well because there’s less pesticides generally, said the former farmer.	Fela mo toropong, o dumela kgotsa o sa dumele, dinotshe di dira sentle ka gonne go na le diboladisenyi di le mmalwa ka kakaretso, go bua molemi wa maloba.
Having a lot of variety is wonderful for bees.	Go nna le mefuta e e farologaneng go siametse dinotshe.

Summary of ANC President Cyril Ramaphosas testimony at the State Capture Inquiry.	Bosupi ba tshobokanyo ya ga Moporesidente wa ANC Cyril Ramaphosa ka nako ya tsheko.
Dealing with the issue of his ANC presidential campaign, Ramaphosa reiterated that the CR17 fund managers did not tell him who gave the campaign money as they did not want him to be beholden to donors.	Go samagana le ntlha ya gagwe ya letsholo la ANC, Ramaphosa o gateletse fa batsamaisi ba matlole ba CR17 ba molobetse gore ke mang yo a neelang letsholo le matlole ka ntlha ya fa ba ne bas a batle batsamaisi ba letlole ba ne ba sa mmolelela ba ba neetseng letsholo le matlole ka gonne ba ne ba sa batle a ipona molato go batho ba ba thusitseng ka matlole.
He denied reports that the campaign raised R1 billion which was used for buying votes from delegates attending the ANCs National Conference in December 2017.	O latotse fa letsholo le sa kgobokanya sedikadike sa diranta di le bilione (R1 billion) tse di dirisitsweng go reka ditlhopho go tswa mo baemeding ba ba neng ba le teng mo khonferenseng ya bosetšhaba ya ANC ka Sedimonthole wa 2017.
It was said a billion rands was raised.	Go kailwe fa didikadike tsa diranta di le dibilione tse di kgobokantsweng
It was never a billion rands.	E ne e se didikadike tsa diranta di le dibilione.
I am told that the money that was raised was some R300 million, but never a billion or so.	Ke boleletswe gore matlole a a neng a kgobokantswe e ne e le sedikadike sa diranta di le makgoloamararo (R300 million), e seng bilione kgotsa go feta.
I don’t know the facts because they literally kept it away from me.	Ga ke itse dintlha ka botlalo ka gonne ba ne ba tsweletse ka go e mpipela.
I said to my comrades right from the beginning I never want to be part of a campaign that is going to descend into all these deviant types of behaviours that we talk about in the ANC-like vote-buying.	Ke buile le baleloko kwa tshimologong gore ga ke batle go nna karolo ya letsholo le ditlamorago tsa lona di tlileng go goga leina la lekoko mo seretseng jaaka go tshwana le go rekwa ga ditlhopho mo ANC.
State Capture Inquiry: Ramaphosa on the party’s delay in investing the Gupta family.	Pegelo ya Dipatlisisa tsa bosenyi mo pusong: Ramaphosa mo ntlheng ya go diegisiwa ga peeletso mo lelapeng la ga Gupta.
The president went on to say that with increasing negative media coverage of the Gupta family and Bosasa, both of which made donations towards the ANC, and its election campaigns, should have been probed sooner.	Moporesidente o tsweletse ka gore ka ntlha ya go gola ga metswedi ya dikgang e e senolang dikakanyo tse di sa siamang tebang le ba lelapa la ga Gupta le Bosasa, e leng ba ba abetseng ANC le matsholo a yona a ditlhopho matlole, go ne go tshwanetswe  go dirwa dipatlisiso ka ponyo ya leitlho. .
In dealing with how to rid the party of fraud and corruption, Ramaphosa says the leadership has the will and the means to do so.	Mo go samaganeng le go fedisa bonweenwee le bosenyi mo lekokong, Ramaphosa a re boeteledipele bo na le thato le bokgoni ba go dira jalo.
Chairperson the difficulty has always been the person is charged then at the same time they are disciplined they stand trial and the disciplinary process has been done and concluded and they are found not guilty in court what do you then do you go back so for instance if the charge was theft in the ANC and the charge is theft in the state what then do you do when they are found not guilty, says Ramaphosa.	Modulasetulo, bothata ke gore motho o a latofatswa mme ka fa go le lengwe go suganwa le go diragatsa ditsela ya kgalemo mme kwa bokhutlong ga ba bonwe molato kwa kgotlatshekelo. Go dirwa eng, a go boelwa kwa morago, sekao fa e le gore molato ke wa bogodu mo ANC go dirwa eng fa e le gore balatofadiwa ga ba bonwe molato, go bua jalo Ramaphosa.
The ANC now requires those facing serious charges to step aside, clear their names and present themselves at the party’s Integrity Committee.

He plans to ask Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula to investigate why the R102 million station is now derelict.	O rulaganya go botsa Tonakgolo ya Dipalangwa Fikile Mbalula go batlisisa gore ke goreng didikadike tsa diranta di le lekgolo le bobedi tsa milione di wela tlase.
The station was built in 2011 but never occupied even though the railway track that passes the station still carries passenger trains.	Seteišene se agilwe ka 2011 mme ga se ise se tsene mo tirisong le seporo se se fetang mo seteišeneng se santse se feta ka bapalami ba diterena.
Our President @Herman Mashaba just arrived at the Greenview train station in Mamelodi!	Moporesitente wa rona Herman Mashaba o gorogile kwa boemelatereneng jwa Greenview kwa Mamelodi.
The building of the Greenview Train station can be seen from a far, but close up, it is a dysfunctional shell with the roof, aluminium windows, door frames, steel, rail tracks and other trimmings stolen by criminals.	Kago ya Boemelaterena jwa Greenview e ka bonwa go tswa kgakala, mme gaufi, ke dithulelo tse di sa tlholeng di dira, matlhabaphefo, dipati,seporo le tse dingwe tse di utswitsweng ke disenyi.
The station that promised so much to the Mpomolong community, next to it, delivered more poverty.	Seteišene se se solofeditseng thata mo baaging ba Mpomolong, se tlisitse bodidi le go feta.
He says the private sector must also be given the opportunity to operate privatised rail services on the rail network.	A re lephata la poraefete le lona le tshwanetse go newa tšhono ya go tsamaisa ditirelo tsa poraefete mo seporong.
Mashaba says he was shocked when he heard about the Greenview Train Station.	Mashaba a re o ne a tshoga fa a fetsa go utlwile ka ga Boemelaterena ba Greenview.
When I was told about this, I said it’s not possible.	Fa ke ne ke bolelelwa ka ga se, ke rile se ga se kgonege.
Though I’ve experienced, more especially looking at our infrastructure, how the ANC government has destroyed our infrastructure over the last 27 years.	Le fa ke na le maitemogelo, segolobogolo fa re lebelela mafaratlhatlha a rona, gore puso ya ANC e sentse mafaratlhatlha a rona dingwaga di le 27.
As you’ve heard early on, well take it up with Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula.	Jaaka o setse o utlwile go sa le gale re tlaa ikgolaganya le Tonakgolo ya Dipalangwa Fikile Mbalula.
The building of the Greenview Train Station was part of a R373-million investment of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) to double the rail tracks between Eerste Fabrieke and Greenview and upgrade the Mamelodi Gardens and Pienaarspoort stations.	Kago ya Boemelaterena ba Greenview ke nngwe dipeeletso tsa sedikadike sa diranta di le makgoloamararo le masomeasupa le boraro ya Setheo sa bapagamaterena mo Aforikaborwa go dira diporo magareng ga Eerste Fabrieke le Greenview le go tlhabolola ditshingwana tsa Mamelodi le diteišene tsa   Pienaarspoort.
Thabo Thobejane-Mphela is unemployed and has been living in an informal area adjoining the derelict station.	Thabo Thobejane-Mphela ke motlhokatiro e bile kgale a tshela mo lefelong le le sa tlhomamang gaufi seteišene.
He says if the project was finished it would have changed the lives of the community.	A re fa porojeke e, e ne e feditswe, e ne e ka tokafatsa kgotsa go fetola matshelo a baagi
Remember if the station works its job opportunity for others, says Thobejane-Mphela.	Gopola gore fa seteišene se ka tlisa tšhono ya tiro go ba bangwe, go bua jalo Thobejane-Mphela.
Thobejane-Mphela says the train station could have presented business opportunities for people and employment for cleaners and security guards.	Thobejane-Mphela a re boemelaterena bo ne bo tshwanetse go tlisa ditšhono tsa kgwebo mo bathong le baphephafatsi mmogo le badisadikago.
He says community members often have to travel far to get transport.	A re ka gale, baaga ba tshwanetse go tsamaya lobaka go fitlhelela sepagangwa.
They go far, there is the last station there, Pienaarspoort.	Ba ya kgakala go fitlha ka seteišene sa bofelo sa  Pienaarspoort.
But if the station was working, it was going to be easy, adds Thobejane-Mphela .	Fa seteišene  se se ne se dira, go ne go tlile go nna bonolo, go bua jalo Thobejane-Mphela.
Prasa indicated to SABC News they will only be able to comment later on the issue.	PRASA e senotse go babegadikgang ba SABC gore ba tlile go kgona go tshwaela moragonyana ka kgang eno.
Mashaba says across South Africa, formerly functional train stations have followed the route of Greenview, having either been gutted by criminals or have fallen into disrepair.	Mashaba a re go ralala Aforikaborwa, diteišene tse di dirang di tshwana fela le sa kwa Greenview, di tlhotlhorilwe ke disenyi kgotsa di wela go tlhatlhamologa.
African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa has told the State Capture Commission of Inquiry that it is untrue that his election at the party’s 54th national conference in 2017 was bought.	Moporesidente wa Lekoko la Bosetšhaba (ANC) Cyril Ramaphose o boleletse Komiti ya Dipatlisiso tsa bosenyi gore ga se boammaaruri gore go tlhophiwa ga gagwe mo lekokong ka khonferense ya lekoko ya bolesometlhano le bone ka 2017 ga e a rekiwa.
Ramaphosa continues with his testimony on Thursday afternoon.	Ramaphosa o tswelela ka go neelana ka bopaki ka Labone thapama.
The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) has commended the private prosecution against National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise.	Lekoko la Temokerasi la Tumelo ya Sekeresete mo mo Aforika le akgola tsheko ya poraefete kgatlhanong le Mmusakgotla wa Bosetšhaba Thandi Modise.
Modise is on trial for alleged animal cruelty that took place on her farm while she was still the Premier of the North West.	Modise o lebanwe ke tsheko mabapi le ditatofatso tsa bosetlhogo mo diphologolong kwa polaseng ya gagwe fa a ne a santse e le Tonakgolo ya Bokone Bophirima.
She is charged with six counts of animal cruelty relating to animals that died on her farm in 2014.	O latofatswa ka melato e le thataro e e amanang le bosetlhogo jwa diphologolo tse di suleng kwa polaseng ya gagwe ka 2014.
The party says this is both good stewardship and a demonstration that no one is above the law.	Lekoko la re se ke kgato e e maleba e bile e bontsha gore ga go ope yo o kwa godimo ga molao.
ACDP senior member of parliament Steve Swarts says the case reflects the highest form of accountability.	Leloko la ACDP Steve Swarts e bile e le tokololo ya palamente a re go bontsha go tlhokega maikarabelo a a magolo mo kgetseng e.
We as ACDP we believe that this is a measure of society to the most vulnerable including its animals, says Swarts.	Jaaka maACDP re dumela gore se ke sesupo sa go bontsha fa setšhaba se sa sireletsega go akaretsa le diphologolo tsa sona.
We also believe that none is above the law including the speaker of the national assembly-the honourable Thandi Modise, adds Swarts.	Re dumela gape gore ga go ope yo o kwa godimo ga molao, go akarediwa le Mmusakgotla wa Bosetšhaba Thandi Modise, Swarts o tlaleletsa ntlha ya gagwe.
Thandi Modise’s animal cruelty case back in court	Kgetse ya ga Thandi Modise mabapi le bosetlhogo jwa diphologolo e buseditswe kwa kgotlatshekelo.
African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa has defended the need for party MPs to toe the party line.	Moporesidente wa Lekoko la Bosetšhaba le le busang (ANC) Cyril Ramaphosa o bontshitse tlhokego ya gore maloko a palamente ba lekoko ba tsamaisane le melawana le ditlhokego tsa lekoko.
Ramaphosa says it is practice the world over that parties exercise discipline over their members who are taken to Parliament on a party list and it is only in exceptional cases where he believes that members should vote with their conscience.	Ramaphosa a re ke tlwaelo lefatshe ka bophara gore makoko a diragatse meono ya bona mo malokong a a isiwang kwa palamenteng mo lenaaneng la lekoko e bile ke mabaka a a itlhaotseng fa a dumelang gore maloko ba tshwanetse go tlhopha go ya ka letswalo la bona.
The ANC President said a number of considerations need to be weighed up as a collective by the caucus.	Moporesidente wa ANC o buile ka ga dintlha tse tshwanetseng go elwa tlhoko mmogo ke komiti.
You have got to look very closely at the consequences of that action.	O tshwanetse go lebelela ka leitlho le le ntšhotšho ditlamorago tsa kgato e.
Because if you vote to remove a President in a vote of no confidence, what then ensues.	Ka gonne fa o tlhopha go tlosa Poresidente ka tlhopho ya go tlhoka boikanyego, ke eng gape se se latelang.
Members have to ask themselves, is that what we want and certainly if that is the desire that is collectively agreed to then that is what has be opted for, explains Ramaphosa.	Ramaphosa o tlhalosa fa maloko a tshwanetse go ipotsa, gore a ke se ba se batlang mme fa e le gore ke keletso ya se go dumalanweng ka sona go raya gore ke tshwetso e e tserweng.
The ANC President says the issue of political party discipline is controversial and continues to plague even mature democracies.	Moporesidente wa ANC a re kgang ya lekoko la sepolotiki mabapi le boitshwarontle ke ngangisano e bile e tswelela pele go nna tlhobaboroko mo temokerasing e e godileng.
Ramaphosa says a tension exists in South Africa’s constitutional framework that often makes the matter tricky to navigate.	Ramaphosa a re matsapa a a teng mo letlhomesong la molaotheo wa Aforikaborwa o o dirang gore kgang e e nne matswakabele go e fenenkolola.
Regret over Gupta Leaks	Maikotlhao mabapi le mathata a a tlileng le ba gaGupta.
Ramaphosa has also expressed regret that the ANC delayed in investigating state capture through Parliaments committees when the allegations first emerged.	Ramaphosa o tlhagisitse gape maikotlhao a gore ANC e diegile go dira dipatlisiso tsa bosenyi mo pusong go ya ka dikomiti tsa palamente ka ditatofatso tsa ntlha.
However, the President has denied that this was due to deliberate resistance.	Le fa go le jalo, Moresidente o ganetsane le ntlha ya gore se, se dirilwe ka maikaelelo.
Ramaphosa was responding to questions as to why the ANC chose to rebuff a proposal by the Democratic Alliance (DA) in March of that year that Parliament probe the allegations emerging from media reports on the Gupta family.	Ramaphosa o ne  fetola dipotso ts gore goreng ANC e ganne kopo ya lekoko la DA ka Mopitlwe ngwaga oo gore Palamente e upolole ka ga ditatofatso tse di tlhagelelang mo dipegelong tsa metswedi ya dikgang mabapi le ba lelapa la gaGupta.
The ANC at the time made a counter proposal that those who had any knowledge of the matter go to the police or the Public Protector.	ANC ka nako eo e tshitshintse gore bao ba nang le kitso mabapi le kgang e ba e go bula kgetsi kwa mapodiseng kgotsa Mosireletsi wa Setšhaba.
The thinking would have been which of the structures that we have in the state that would have greater effectiveness of investigating these matters and coming to a conclusion that prosecutorial processes should commence.	Go ne go tshwanetse gore go akanngwe gore ditheo di fe tse re nang le tsone mo nageng tse di ka bong di thusitse ka matsetseleko go batlisisa mathata le go dira diphitlhelelo tsa gore dipatlisiso tsa bosenyi di tshwanetse go simolola.
It was thought at the time that other institutions [like] the Public Protector, the South African Police Service (SAPS) may have had a better grip on all these matters, explains Ramaphosa.	Ramaphosa o tlhalosa fa go ne go akanngwa ka nako eo gore ditheo tse dingwe jaaka sa Tshireletso ya Setšhaba, Tirelo ya Sepodisi sa Aforikaborwa (SAPS) di ne di ka nna le tharabololo e e botoka ya mathata a. le go nna a a botoka a grip ka ga dintlha tse, o tlhalosa jalo Ramaphosa.
On Wednesday, Ramaphosa said the governing party’s internal party funding guidelines were not suited for the time we live in.	Ka Laboraro, Ramaphosa o rile dikaelo tsa setlamo sa matlole sa lekoko le le busang di ne di sa tsamaisane le nako e ba tshelang mo go yona.
Ramaphosa dealt with the risks of corruption attached to the lack of transparency in the donations and funding political parties receive.	Ramaphosa o semagane le mathata a bosenyi a a amanang le tlhokego ya go baya dilo mo pepeneneng mabapi le diketleetso le matlole a lekoko le a amogelang.
He said this was why the Political Party Funding Act that came in force at the beginning of April, was necessary.	O rile ntlha e, ke yona e tlhotlheleditseng gore go tsenngwe molawana wa lekoko la sepolotiki wa tsamaiso ya matlole ka tshoganyetso, molawana o o tlhabetswe ke letsatsi Moranang a tlhola, jaaka go ne go tlhokega.
However, he added the funding of internal party campaigns needed to be looked at.	Le fa go le jalo, o tsweletse ka go akgela fa matsholo a matlole a lekoko a tlhoka go lebelelwa sentle.
Below is Ramaphosa’s opening statement made on Wednesday:	Fa tlase ke ntlha e e senotsweng ke Ramaphosa ka Laboraro:
African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa has admitted that the ruling party was delayed in its reaction to emerging evidence on the Gupta family’s influence in the country.	Moporesidente wa Lekoko la Bosetšhaba le le busang (ANC) Cyril Ramaphosa o dumetse gore lekoko le le busang le diegile go tsereganya ka ga bopaki jo bo ribologileng mabapi le phokedi ya ba lelapa la gaGupta mo nageng.
Ramaphosa says the emails shedding light on this, known as the Gupta Leaks, had presented a flood of evidence, which required Parliament to begin its work on the matter.	 Ramaphosa a re di e-meile di senola se mo pepeneneng mabapi le se se itsegeng jaaka Gupta Leaks, go senotswe bosupi jo bo bontshang tlhokego ya gore Palamente e simolole go sugana le mathata a.
Ramaphosa is testifying for a second day at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in his capacity as the leader of the governing party.	Ramaphosa o neelana ka bosupi mo letsatsing la gagwe kwa Khomišeneng ya Dipatlisiso tsa bosenyi mo pusong jaaka e le moeteledipele wa lekoko le le busang.
The Gupta leaks in 2017 presented a flood of evidence which could see the 2012 ANC National Conference resolution of more activist parliamentarians activated according to Ramaphosa	Ka 2017 ditshupetso tsa bag a Gupta di tlhagisa bosupi jo bogolo jo bo ka re busetsang kwa khonferenseng ya Bosetšhaba ya ANC ya go tlhaola bapalamente ba bolwantsha bosenyi, go ya ka Ramaphosa.
The Gupta leak emails were a flood of evidence that required the Parliament to start doing its work.	Di e-meile tsa ga Gupta di nnile bosupi jo bogolo jo bo tlhokang gore Palamente e simolole go dira tiro ya bona.
Ramaphosa says he regrets that the ANC delayed in investigating state capture through parliaments committees but denies that this was due to deliberate resistance.	Ramaphosa a re o maswabi gore ANC e diegisitse dipatlisiso go batlisisa ka ga bosenyi mo pusong mo dikomiting tsa palamente mme o ganela fa se e se ka maikaelelo.
Ramaphosa was responding to questions on why the ANC chose to rebuff a proposal by the DA in March of that year that parliament probe the allegations emerging from media reports on the Gupta family.	Ramaphosa  o ne  fetola dipotso tsa gore goreng ANC e ganne kopo ya lekoko la DA ka Mopitlwe ngwaga oo gore Palamente e upolole ka ga ditatofatso tse di tlhagelelang mo dipegelong tsa metswedi ya dikgang mabapi le ba lelapa la gaGupta.
The thinking would have been which of the structures that we have in the state that would have greater effectiveness of investigating these matters and coming to a conclusion that prosecutorial processes should comment it was through at the time that other institutions the Public Protector, the Police may have had a better grip on all these matters, he says.	Go ne go tshwanetse gore go akanngwe gore ditheo di fe tse re nang le tsone mo nageng tse di ka bong di thusitse ka matsetseleko go batlisisa mathata le go dira diphitlhelelo tsa gore dipatlisiso tsa bosenyi di tshwanetse go simolola, e ne ele ka nako eo gore ditheo tse dingwe jaaka sa Tshireletso ya Setšhaba, Sepodisi di ne di ka nna le tharabololo e e botoka ya mathata a, a rialo.
Ramaphosa says the emergence of the Gupta leaks had activated Parliament’s role to respond to the evidence.	Ramaphosa a re thibololo ya Gupta Leaks e tsentse Palamente matlhagatlhaga a go tsibogela bosupi jo.
Once these Gupta leak emails came out, it became clear to many of us that there needed to be a response of some sort.	Morago ga go bipologa ga di e-meile tsa Gupta leaks, go tlile mo pepeneneng gore bontsi jwa rona re tlhoka go tsibogela se ka mokgwa mongwe.
The ANC knew that it needed to get to the bottom of this on a number of other structures.	Lekoko la ANC le ne le itse gore go ne go tlhokega gore ba lebelele se go ya ka ditheo tse dingwe.
This would have been in line with what Parliament needed to do at that time because a flood of evidence was now becoming evident and available, explains President Ramaphosa.	Se, se ne se tshwanelwa ke go tsamaisana le se Palamente e neng e tlhoka go se dira ka nako eo ka gonne bosupi jo bo ne bo itlhalosa e bile bo le mo pepeneneng, go tlhalosa Ramaphosa.
On Wednesday, he was quizzed on the impact of cadre deployment.	Ka Laboraro, o ne a botsiwa ka ga seabe sa setlhopha sa bothapi.
Ramaphosa said he was not at the State Capture Commission to make excuses for the governing party or defend the indefensible.	Ramaphosa o rile o ne a se teng kwa khomišeneng ya dipatlisiso tsa bosenyi mo pusong go emelela lekoko le le busang kgotsa go ngangisana ka se se sa ngangisegeng.
The ANC has taken this position knowing that the organisation itself would be placed under great scrutiny and that the process of examining these matters will be difficult and painful for the ANC.	ANC e tsene mo maemong a, e itse gore mokgatlho ka bo ona o ka batlisisiwa le gore thulaganyo ya dipatlisiso e ka nna bokete le botlhoko mo ANC.
Nevertheless, the ANC maintains that this commission is a necessary part of the broader social effort of ending all forms of state capture and corruption, said Ramaphosa.	Le fa go ntse jalo, mokgatlho wa ANC o dumela gore Khomišine eno ke karolo e e botlhokwa ya dikakanyo tsa maiteko a go fedisa mefuta yotlhe ya bosenyi mo pusong, a rialo Ramaphosa.
Political analyst at the North West University, Professor Andre Duvenhage, says he expects a fight back from Supra Mahumapelo, following his five-year suspension from the ANC.	Moitseanape wa dipoletiki kwa Yunibesithing ya Bokone Bophirima, Moporofesara Andre Duvenhage, a re o solofetse boipusolosetso go tswa kwa go Supra Mahumapelo tebang le dingwaga di le tlhano a sekegilwe mo ANC.
Mahumapelo and the acting provincial secretary of the ANC Women’s League, Bitsa Lenkopane, were suspended from the governing party yesterday.	Mahumapelo le Mokwaledi wa nakwana wa Mokgatlho wa Basadi wa ANC, Bitsa Lenkopane, ba sekegilwe mo lekokong le le busang maabane.
They were both found guilty of misconduct for convening a parallel meeting to that of the Interim Provincial Committee in Mareetsane near Mahikeng last year.	Bobedi jo, bo ne ba bonwa molato ka maitsholomabe morago ga go tshwara kopano e e tsamaelanang le ya Komiti ya Nakwana ya Porofence (IPC) kwa Mareetsane gaufi le kwa Mafikeng ngogola.
Duvenhage says he foresees Mahumapelo and the so-called RET forces in the ANC forming a breakaway party from the ANC.	Duvenhage a re o bonelapele Mahumapelo le se se bidiwang RET forcers mo ANC go nna mathuga a digongwana go tswa mo lekokong la ANC.
He’s going to fight back, he’s going to mobilise.	O tlile go tliele go lwantsha se, o tlile go bolotsa letsholo.
I think, maybe a stronger scenario at this point is a break-away from the ANC.	Ke akanya gore, ntlha e e maatla mo lebakeng le ke go tswa mo ANC.
I think the room and the space, for the RET group is becoming smaller and smaller.	Ke akanya gore phaposing le manno, a setlhopha sa maRET e tsweletse go ngotlega.
And as a result of that, the option for them jumping ship is becoming bigger and bigger, says Duvenhage.	Ka ntlha e, ba na le tšhono e e kgolo ya go ka tlolela sekepe, go bua Duvenhage.
Political analyst, Barry Hanyane, believes Mahumapelo’s influence within the provincial ANC ranks has come to an end.	Moitseanape wa dipolotiki, Barry Hanyane, o dumela gore phokedi ya ga Mahumapelo mo Lekokong la porofense e ya kwa bokhutlong.
The former Premier has been put under the bus; even if he were to appeal it is pretty much the end of his influence in the province.	Tonakgolo ya maloba o sokelwa dirope, le fa a ne a ka dira boikuelo mme go a bontsha gore phokedi ya gagwe mo porofenseng e phirimilelwa ke letsatsi.
Even if he were to appeal, for a mere fact that he’s been cast out as someone who’s rebellious and someone where perhaps would want to revive suspended for five years from the ANC.	Le fa a ne a ka dira boikuelo, tebang le lebaka la gore o ntse a sekegilwe jaaka motsuolodi le mongwe yo a gongwe a batlang go tsosolosa tshekego ya gagwe ya dingwaga di le tlhano mo ANC.
Whether there’s an appeal or not, it spells a death knell for his political career especially in his province, says Hanyane.	Gore go na le boikuelo kgotsa nnyaa, se se tlhalosa bokhutlo jwa tiro ya gagwe ya sepolotiki, segolobogolo mo porofenseng ya gagwe, go bua jalo Hanyane.
Mahumapelo is expected to hold a press briefing on Thursday afternoon	Mahumapelo o solofetswe go tshwara kopano ya bobegakgang ka Labone thapama.
ANC alliance partners in the North West say they hope other members of the party will learn from Mahumapelo’s suspension that no one is above the party.	Mokgatlho wa badirammogo ba ANC mo Bokone Bophirima wa re ba solofela gore maloko a mangwe a lekoko ba tlaa ithuta go tswa mo go go sekegiweng ga ga Mahumapelo gore ga go ope yo a kwa godimo ga molao wa lekoko.
The African National Congress (ANCs) Mangaung region in the Free State has thrown its weight behind the National Executive Committees (NEC) resolution that members who are charged with corruption should step aside.	Lekoko la Bosetšhaba le le busang (ANCs) kwa Mangaung kwa Foreisetata  le dirisa dithata tsa bona le ba Komiti ya Khuduthamaga ya Bosetšhaba (NEC) ka tshwetso ya gore maloko a a bonweng molato wa bosenyi ba tshwanetse go sekegwa kwa thoko.
The Regions Deputy Convener, Sabelo Pitso, has told a media briefing at the party’s provincial headquarters in Bloemfontein that no one is above the ANC.	Motlatsamodulasetulo wa Dikgaolo, Sabelo Pitso, o boleletse bobegakgang kwa dikantorokgolo tsa kekoko mo porofenseng kwa Bloemfontein gore ga go ope yo o kwa godimo ga ANC.
He urged party members not to allow themselves to be manipulated by forces that are not willing to subject themselves to organisational discipline.	O rotloeditse maloko a lekoko gore ba seke ba letla go bipiwa ka bobi mo matlhong ke ba ba sa ikemisetsang go latela thulaganyo ya kgalemo.
True cadres of and members of the ANC always voluntarily subject themselves to organisational discipline.	Ditokololo tsa Mokgatlho wa ANC tsa boammaaruri ka gale ka go ithaopa go latela thulaganyo ya kgalemo.
This is exactly what Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma did in the past irrespective of personal wishes and preferences.	Se, ke se Thabo Mbeki le Jacob Zuma ba sedirileng mo nakong e e fetileng go sa kgathalesege ka ga dikeletso tsa motho le dikgatlhegelo.
Once the NEC took a decision to recall them, they never sought to influence the gullible branches to cause confusion, disability and disorder, adds Pitso.	Fa NEC e tsaya tshwetso ya go ba bitsa, ga ba a ka ba batla go tlhotlheletsa tlhakatlhakano mo go ba bangwe go tlhola ketsaetsego, bogole le tlhakatlhakano, Pitso o gatisa ntlha ya gagwe.
In the Free State to date, three of the five regions have rejected the imminent stepping down of the party’s secretary-general Ace Magashule.	Kwa Foreisetata go fitlha ga jaana, le dikgaolo di le tlhano ga di inyalane le go rolwa tiro ga mokwaledimogolo wa lekoko Ace Magashule.
They are Fezile Dabi, Lejweleputswa and Maluti-A-Phofung.	 Ke bo Fezile Dabi, Lejweleputswa le Maluti-A-Phofung.
The Fezile Dabi region has gone as far as threating to interdict the ANCs NECs step-aside decision.	Kgaolo ya Fezile Dabi e ile ya dira matshosetsi morago ga tshwetso ya ANCs NECs ya go rola Magashule tiro.
Magashule is one of ANC leaders who face fraud and corruption charges.	Magashule ke mongwe wa baeteledipele ba ANC b aba lebaganeng le bosenyi le bonweenwee.
Friday is D-Day for them to step down from their leadership positions.	Labotlhano ke letsatsi la bofelo la bona go rola tiro go tswa mo maemong a bona a boeteledipele.
Failure to do so will lead to their suspension from the governing party.	Go retelelwa ke go dira jalo, go tlile go dira gore ba sekegwe mo lekokong le le busang.

ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa is testifying for a second day at the State Capture Inquiry.	Moporesidente wa ANC Cyril Ramaphosa o neela bosupi ka letsatsi la bobedi kwa Khomišeneng ya dipatlisiso tsa bosenyi mo pusong.
Yesterday while answering questions on the impact of cadre deployment on the functioning of the state, Ramaphosa said a balance needs to be struck between establishing a professional public service and delivering, what he says, is the ANC’s developmental mandate.	Maabane fa a araba dipotso ka ga seabe sa setlhopha sa bothapi mo pusong, Ramaphosa o rile tekano e tshwanetse go dirwa magareng ga go tlhoma tirelo ya setšhaba ka mokgwa wa seporofešenale, se a se buang ke taelo ya ANC ya ditlhabololo.
He told the commission that appointments in the state should be made in an open manner so that state capture never again happens in South Africa.	O ne a bolelela Khomišene gore go tlhomiwa ga bone mo puso go tshwanetse go dirwa mo pontsheng gore puso e tlhaloganya se gape se diragala mo Aforikaborwa.
Today he is expected to answer questions about his 2017 ANC Presidential Campaign.	Gompieno o solofetswe go araba dipotso ka ga Letsholo la gagwe la boporesidente mo ANC ka 2017.
1He will also be questioned about the Gupta brothers amid claims that they showered some ANC members with gifts and money.	O tlile go botsolotswa ka ga barwa Gupta mabapi le magatwe a gore ba ne ba reka maloko mangwe a lekoko ka dimpho le madi.
The alliance partners of the African National Congress (ANC) in the North West say they hope other members of the party will learn from Supra Mahumapelo’s suspension that no one is above the party.	Mokgatlho wa badirammogo ba Lekoko la Bosetšhaba (ANC) mo Bokone Bophirima ba re ba solofela gore maloko a mangwe a tlaa ithuta mo go sekegweng gag a Supra Mahumapelo gore ga go ope yo a kwa godimo ga lekoko.
The former chairperson of the ANC and the acting provincial secretary of the ANC Women’s League, Bitsa Lenkopane, were suspended for five years from the ANC on Wednesday.	Modulasetulo wa maloba wa ANC le Mokwaledi wa nakwana wa porofense wa Mokgatlho wa Basadi, Bitsa Lenkopane, ba sekegilwe dingwaga di le tlhano mo ANC ka Laboraro.
Cosatu Provincial Secretary, Kopano Konopi, says, we feel that it is high time the ANC becomes decisive on issues of discipline and demonstrate to all its members that discipline is something that must be obeyed in the ANC.	Mokwaledi wa Cosatu mo Porofenseng, Kopano Konopi a re o akanya gore ke nako e e maleba ya gore ANC e simolole go lebelela merero ya boitshwaro le go bontsha ditokololo tsotlhe tsa yona gore se ke selo se re tshwanetseng go se obamelwa mo ANC.

I’m hoping to hear a full disclosure about the ANC’s policy of cadre deployment and how it lasted to the very part of enabling the state capture to take place.	 Ke na le tsholofelo ya go utlwa boammaaruri ka botlalo ka ga pholisi ya ANC ya setlhopha sa tlhokomelo ya badiri le ka moo e tsereng karolo go kgontsha dipatlisiso tsa bosenyi go tswa letsholo.
Many government departments cannot deliver even on the most basic mandates.	Bontsi jwa mafapha a puso a retelelwa ke go diragatsa ditaelo tsa bona
And cadre deployment part of that people are not put into position on their ability to do their job and serve citizens, but their ability to channel money.	E bile setlhopha sa tlhokomelo ya badiri jaaka karolo ya setšhaba ga ba a neelwa maemo a fela ka bokgoni jwa bona jwa go dira ditiro le go direla baagi, mme bokgoni jwa bona jwa go dirasa madi.
According to Ramaphosa the ANC did not do enough to fight corruption and state capture.	Go ya ka Ramaphosa, ANC ga e a dira go tlala seatla mo go lwantsheng bosenyi mo pusong.
He says it was only in hindsight what was taking place became clear.	A re go ne ga elwa tlhoko fa se se neng se diragala se sena go tlhagelela mo pepeneneng.
In his opening statement, Ramaphosa said he was not at the State Capture Commission to make excuses for the governing party or defend the indefensible.	Mo puong ya gagwe ya pulomadibogo, Ramaphosa o rile o ne a se teng kwa khomišeneng ya dipatlisiso tsa bosenyi mo pusong go emelela lekoko le le busang kgotsa go ngangisana ka se se sa ngangisegeng.
Nevertheless, the ANC maintains that this commission is a necessary part of the broader social effort of ending all forms of state capture and corruption.	Le fa go ntse jalo, mokgatlho wa ANC o dumela gore Khomišine eno ke karolo e e botlhokwa ya dikakanyo tsa maiteko a go fedisa mefuta yotlhe ya bosenyi mo pusong.
Ramaphosa said the party did not take much cognisance when the phenomenon of state capture was first raised by Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula at a 2011 National Executive Committee meeting.	Ramaphosa o rile lekoko ga le a tla ka malepa a a botlhale fa sebonelo sa bosenyi mo pusong se se tlhagisiwa sa ntlha ke Tonakgolo ya Dipalangwa Fikile Mbalula ka 2011 kwa kopanong ya Komiti ya Khuduthamaga ya Bosetšhaba.
Mbalula said he had been informed of his cabinet appointment, by Ajay Gupta, before it took place.	Mbalula a re o lomilwe tsebe ke Ajay Gupta mabapi le go thapiwa ga gagwe jaaka mokabinete, pele e seo se diragala.
He says subsequent interventions by then-Parliamentary Whip, the late Jackson Mthembu and then-Secretary General Gwede Mantashe, were inadequate.	A re go tsena ga Bapalamente, moswi Jackson Mthembu le mokwaledikakaretso Gwede Mantashe, ga se gone.
It had shortcomings in living up to the expectations of the people of South Africa in relation to enforcing accountability and engendering a culture of effective consequence management as the leadership of the ANC duly elected at the 54th Conference.	Go retelelwa ke go diragatsa ditsholofelo tsa Maaforikaborwa mabapi le tsaya maikarabelo le go tsenya tsamaiso e e sa lekanang ya boeteledipele ya ANC e e tlhophilweng ka khonferense ya dingwagakgolo tsa masomeamatlhano le bone (54th conference) .
State Capture Inquiry Commission hears evidence from the President of the ANC, Cyril Ramaphosa.	Khomišene ya Dipatlisiso tsa bosenyi mo pusong e reetsa bopaki jwa Moporesidente wa ANC, Cyril Ramaphosa.
The ANC Disciplinary Committee in the North West has found both former premier Supra Mahumapelo and ANC Women’s League Acting Secretary, Bitsa Lenkopane guilty of misconduct.	Komiti ya dikgato-kgalemo mo Bokone Bophirima e boneTonakgolo ya maloba Supra Mahumapelo le mokwaledi wa nakwana wa Mokgatlho wa Basadi wa ANC, Lenkopane molato wa maitsholomabe.
Chairperson of the ANC Provincial Disciplinary Committee, Wendy Matsemela, says both Mahumapelo and Lenkopane have been suspended from the party for five years.	Modulasetulo wa Mokgatlho wa ANC ya komiti ya dikgato-kgalemo mo porofenseng, Wend Matsemela a re bobedi jo, Mahumapelo le Lenkopane ba sekegilwe mo lekokong dingwaga di le tlhano.
Both the above-mentioned respondents have been found guilty as charged.	Bobedi jo bo umakilweng fa godimo, bo bonwe molato.
The committee, therefore, concluded on the following: That both members are hereby suspended from the ANC for a period of five years with immediate effect. 	Ka jalo. Komiti, e konoseditse mo go tse di latelang: Gore maloko a tlaa sekegiwa mo ANC dingwaga di le tlhano ka ponyo ya leitlho.
And that both the respondents must be removed from the lists of public representatives of the ANC.	Le gore ka bobedi ba tshwanetse go tlosiwa go tswa mo manaaneng a baemedi ba setšhaba a ANC.
Mahumapelo and Lenkopane had held a meeting in Mareetsane village in the Ratlou municipality near an event organised by the party’s Interim Provincial Committee.	Mahumapelo le Lenkopan ba ne ba tshwere kopano kwa Mareetsane mo mmasepaleng wa Ratlou gaufi le tiragalo e e rulagantsweng ke Komoiti ya Nakwana ya lekoko mo Porofenseng.
Matsemela says the disciplinary committee has further recommended that both Mahumapelo and Lenkopane, attend a political leadership programme.	Matsemela a re komiti ya dikgato-kgalemo e ne ya tshitshinya gore bobedi jo Mahumapelo le Lenkopane ba tsenela manaane a boeteledipele jwa sepolotiki.

The African National Congress (ANC) did not do enough to fight corruption and state capture, according to party President Cyril Ramaphosa.	Lekokola lele busang la ANC ga le a dira go tlala seatla go lwantsha bogodu le bosenyi mo pusong, go ya ka Moporesidente Cyril Ramaphosa.
Ramaphosa made this acknowledgment at the State Capture Commission on Wednesday.	Ramaphosa o amogetse se kwa Khomišeneng ya Dipatlisiso tsa Bosenyi mo pusong ka Laboraro.
Questioned about the ANCs development and deployment policy, Ramaphosa defended it saying it is not unique to the party and could not be faulted in principle.	Dipotso mabapi le ANC ka ga tlhabololo le tiriso  ya pholisi Ramaphosa o dibetse se ka gore ga se tlholo ntšhwa mo lekokong e bile ga se phoso mo molawaneng.
The policy has been blamed for breeding conditions for state capture, promoting factionalism, and poor service delivery.	Pholisi e, e supiwa ka monwana go tlhola maemo a bosenyi mo pusong, go rotloetsa boitirelo le thebolelo e e bokoa ya ditirelo.
Cadre deployment cannot be faulted in principle.	Setlhopha sa tlhokomelo ya badiri se ka se supiwe ka monwana mo molawaneng.
It’s a common feature of democratic practice around the world and I think if properly described and not diluted through various other intents and forms, it is a useful process used by governing parties around the world to make sure that the mandate that they are given by the populace is carried out.	Go ponagalo e e tshwanang le ya temokerasi mo lefatsheng mme ke akanya gore fa go ka tlhalosiwa sentle le go lebelela matlhakore a mangwe a a farologaneng, ke thulaganyo e e mosola e e neng lekoko le le busang le e dirisa mo lefatsheng go netefatsa gore tiro e ba e filweng e a dirwa.
But we would concede that there are weaknesses in its practical implementation, that makes the case for greater clarity both within political parties and the state.	Mme re ka bo re dumetse gore go na le makoa mo go tsenngwa tirisong ga ona, go dira gore kgetse e senoge ka tlhamalalo mo makokong a sepolotiki le mo pusong.
On the issue of a number of appointments made to SOE boards by Former President Jacob Zuma, allegedly with the aim of capturing the state, Ramaphosa pleaded ignorance.	Mo ntlheng ya bathapiwa ba le mmalwa mo botong ya SOE Palo ke Moporesidente wa, maloba Jacob Zuma, e le ka maikaelelo a go senyetsa puso, Ramaphosa a itshela moriti o o tsididi.
He said it was possible to make appointments without going through the Deployment Committee as he himself as state president had done in error and some were made before he became party deputy president.	O rile go ne go kgonega go ka thapiwa kwa ntle ga go dirisa Komiti ya bothapi jaaka le ene e le  Moporesidente wa puso go ne ga dirwa phoso mme tse dingwe di ne di dirilwe pele a nna Motlatsa Mporesidente.
Ramaphosa will return to the stand on Thursday to continue his testimony.	Ramaphosa o tlaa boela kwa kgotleng ka Labone go tswelela ka bosupi jwa gagwe.
The policy has often come under fire for the poor levels of service delivery by the ANC government due to some officials being unqualified to perform their work, a situation that Ramaphosa does acknowledge as occurred in some instances.	Pholisi e setse e tlhaelela mo merusong tebang le thebolelo e e bokoa ya ditirelo tsa lekoko le le busang la ANC ka ntlha ya go retelelwa ga badiri go dira tiro ya bona, maemo a Ramaphosa a a amogelang jaaka nngwe ya mabaka a mangwe gareng ga a mangwe.
ANC Deployment Committee plays a recommendation and reactive role.	Komitoi ya Bothapi ya ANC e tshameka karolo e e kgolo mo go atlenegiseng le go tsereganya.
Earlier, Ramaphosa said he is not at the State Capture Commission to make excuses for the governing party or defend the indefensible.	Le gale, Ramaphosa o ne a re o ne a seo kwa Khomišeneng ya Dipatlisiso tsa bosenyi mo pusong go dira maipato a lekoko le le busang kgotsa go sireletsa ba ba sa tlhokeng tshireletso.
He has reiterated the ANC and governments support for the work of the Commission as part of strengthening the country’s democracy.	O gateletse fa tshegetso ya ANC le puso mo tirong ya Khomišene e le karolo ya go matlafatsa temokerasi mo nageng.
Nevertheless, the ANC maintains that this commission is a necessary part of the broader social effort of ending all forms of state capture and corruption, says Ramaphosa.	Le fa go ntse jalo, mokgatlho wa ANC o dumela gore Khomišine eno ke karolo e e botlhokwa ya dikakanyo tsa maiteko a go fedisa mefuta yotlhe ya bosenyi le bogodu mo pusong go bona le bobodu, ga bua Ramaphosa.
Ramaphosa says the party has for a long time recognised the risk presented by the lack of regulation with respect to political funding.	Ramaphosa a re lekoko le na le nako e e telele go lemoga mathata a a tlisiwang ke tlhokego ya taolo ya matlole a sepolotiki.
Ramaphosa says despite the risks, any successful multiparty democracy requires funding in order to meet the needs of the electorate.	Ramaphosa a re ntle le mathata, Katlego ya makokomantsi mo temokerasing e tlhoka thuso ya matlole go kgona go fitlhelela ditlhokego tsa ditlhopho.
He says parties need funding from their own members, from individuals and businesses.	A re makoko a tlhoka thuso ya matlole go tswa mo go bona, go tswa mo bathong le mo dikgwebong.
The ANC President says before the enactment of the Political Funding Act which came into effect on the 1st of April 2021, there were few restrictions on funding which the Act seeks to address.	Moporesidente wa ANC a re pele ga go tsenngwa tirisong ga Molawana wa tlamelo ka matlole a Sepolotiki e e tsentswe tirisong ka di 1 Moranang 2021, go ne go na le dikgwetlho di le mmalwa tsa matlole tse Molawana o o batlang go di rarabolola.
The lack of transparency with respect to political funding increases the potential for corruption and the exercise of improper influence on political activity and government processes.	Tlhaelo ya go direla dilo mo pepeneneng malebana le matlole a sepolotiki go oketsa ditšhono tsa bosenyi le phokedi ya ditiro tse di sa siamang mo sepolotiking le dithulaganyo tsa puso.
It wants to resolve this problem that the ANC resolved at its 54th conference that the ANC should champion the introduction of a comprehensive system of public funding of the representatives of political parties in the different spheres of government and civil society, he adds.	Go batla go rarabolola bothata jo bo tlhageletseng kwa khonferenseng ya dingwagakgolo tsa masomeamatlhano le bone gore ANC e tshwanetse go tsenya mekgwa e e mešwa ya tsamaiso ya matlole a setšhaba ya baemedi ba mekgatlho ya sepolotiki go ya ka mafapha a a farologaneng a puso le setšhaba.
Ramaphosa says the party did not do enough to fight corruption and state capture.	Ramaphosa a re lekoko ga le a dira go tlala seatla go lwantsha bosenyi mo pusong.
He has acknowledged that the party did not take much cognisance when the matter was first raised by Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula at a 2011 National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting.	O a amogelwa gore lekoko le le sa tsaya botennye thata fa kgetse e ne e le ya ntlha e e tlhagisitsweng ke Tona ya Dipalangwa Fikile Mbalula ka 2011 Komiti ya Khuduthamaga ya Bosetšhaba (NEC).
He says although there were subsequent interventions on the issue by then-Parliamentary Whip, the late Jackson Mthembu and then secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, these were inadequate.	A re le fa go ne go na le ditsereganyo tse di lebaneng Bapalamente, moswi Jackson Mthembu le Mokwaledi Kakaretso Gwede Mantashe, tse di ne di sa siama.
It had shortcomings in living up to the expectations of the people of South Africa in relation to enforcing accountability and engendering a culture of effective consequence management.	Go na le mathata ka go tshela go ditsholofelo tsa Batho ba Aforikaborwa mabapi le go gatelela maikarabelo le mo tsenya mo kotsing mowa wa tsamaiso e e nonofileng ya ntlha.
As the leadership of the ANC duly elected at the 54th Conference, we acknowledge these shortcomings as an organisation. 	Jaaka boeteledipele jwa ANC jo bo tlhophilweng ka khonferense ya dingwagakgolo tsa masomeamatlhano le bone, re lemoga ditlhaelo tse jaaka mokgatlho.
African National Congress (ANC) president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has told the State Capture Commission of Inquiry that the ANC has, over the course of several years, recognised the existence of corruption within the state, its own ranks and other parts of society.	Moporesidente wa lekoko la Bosetšhaba ANC Cyril  Ramaphosa o ne a bolelela Khomišene ya Dipatlisiso tsa bosenyi mo pusong gore ya ANC, mo tsamaong ya dingwaga di le mmalwa, e ne ya lemoga fa bosenyi bo le teng mo pusong, mo makaleng a yona le dikarolo tse dingwe tsa setšhaba.
He added that the party could, and should, have done more to prevent the abuse of power and resources.	O gatisa ka gore lekoko le tshwanetse e bile le tshwanelwa ke go ka bo ba tiisitse seatla go thibela tiriso e e botlhaswa ya dithata le didiriswa.
Ramaphosa continues with his testimony at the commission on Wednesday afternoon.	Ramaphosa o tlaa tswelela ka go neela bosupi jwa gagwe kwa Khomišeneng ka Laboraro thapama.
In his opening statement to the State Capture Commission, Ramaphosa dealt with the risks of corruption attached to the lack of transparency in the donations and funding political parties receive.	Mo puong ya gagwe ya pulomadibogo, Ramaphosa o sugane le mathata a bosenyi a a amanang le tlhokego ya sa direleng dilo mo pepeneneng tebang le diketleetso le matlole a makoko a sepolotiki a a amogelang.
I said as President in the absence of clear appropriate and realistic guidelines, our leadership contests will continue to play themselves out in the shadows, in conditions of secrecy and mistrust encouraging patronage and factionalism.	Ke buile jaaka Moporesitente kwa ntle ga dikaelo tse di totang e bile e le tsa boammaaruri, boeteledipele bo dumela go tswelela go ikentsha mo go direleng dilo mo lefifing le mo sephiring le go tlhoka botshepegi mmogo le go rotloetsa tshegetso ya ditirego.
Ramaphosa says the issue of state capture has been a matter of great political contestation for several years within the governing party.	Ramaphosa o bua fa kgang ya bosenyi mo pusong e ntse e le pharela ya bothata jo bogolo mo polotiking dingwaga di le mmalwa mo lekoko le le busang.
Ramaphosa’s much anticipated two-part appearance is due to focus on among others his tenure as party Deputy President, as well as his role as the chairperson of the ANC Cadre Deployment Committee.

Ramaphosa says the party has taken a number of resolutions to prevent corruption.	Ramaphosa a re lekoko le latela ditshwetso di le mmalwa go thibela bonweenwee.
The ANC has, over the course of several years, recognised the existence of corruption within the state, its own ranks and other parts of society.	ANC e, mo tsamaong ya dingwaga di le mmalwa, e lemogile go nna teng ga bobodu mo pusong, mo maemong a a farologaneng le dikarolo tse dingwe tsa setšhaba.

We must acknowledge that the issue of state capture has been a matter of great political contestation within the ANC’s differences over whether state capture existed, its extent and form and what should be done about it, adds the President.

The ANC President has begun testifying before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture.	Moporesidente wa ANC o simolotse go neelana ka bosupi kwa Khomišeneng ya Dipatlisiso tsa bosenyi mo pusong.
Ramaphosa’s much anticipated two-part appearance before the Commission is expected to focus on among others his tenure as party deputy president, including his role as the chairperson of the ANC Cadre Deployment Committee.

Mr President, we are happy that you are here, representing the ruling party.	Rre Moporesidente, re itumelela gore o fano, o emeletse lekoko le le busang.
We are happy that the President of the party is the one who comes to give evidence to the commission.	Re itumelela gore Moporesitente wa lekoko le le busang ke ena a tlileng go neelana ka bosupi kwa  Khomišeneng.
I also want to say that your appearance before this commission is not a result of a decision taken recently, it is a decision that was taken in 2018 as you will remember, says Zondo.	Gape ke batla go gatisa gore go tlhagelela fa Khomišeneng eno ga se ntlha ya tshwetso e e tserweng e se kgale, ke tshwetso e e tserweng ka 2018 jaaka o tla gakologelwa, ga bua jalo Zondo.
Ramaphosa has reiterated the ANC and governments support for the work of the Commission as part of strengthening the country’s democracy.	Ramaphosa o gatisitse fa tsegetso ya ANC le puso mo tirong ya Khomišene ke karolo ya go matlafatsa temokerasi ya naga.

Re sa ntse re le foo, Moatlhodi Zondo a re kantoro ya ga Ramaphosa e tla longwa tsebe mabapi le phetogo ya matlha ka Motsheganong gore Moresidente a tlhagelele kwa Khomišeneng.
Ramaphosa was due to appear before the commission on the 13th and 14th of May to provide evidence as the President of the country and the Deputy President during the Jacob Zuma administration.	Ramaphosa o ne a beetswe go tlhagelela kwa Khomišeneng ka di 13 le di 14 tsa Motsheganong go neelana ka bosupi jaaka Moresidente wa naga le Motlatsa Moporesitente Jacob Zuma ka nako ya tsamaiso ya gagwe.

The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture is to hear evidence from the President of the ANC Cyril Ramaphosa.	Khomišene ya Dipatlisiso tsa bosenyi mo pusong e solofetse go reetsa bosupi go tswa kwa go Moporesidente wa ANC Cyril Ramaphosa.
The Democratic Alliance (DA) has outlined their expectations ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s appearance at the Commission of Inquiry into allegations of State Capture on Wednesday, saying they want the African National Congress (ANCs) Cadre Deployment Policy to be addressed.	Lekoko la DA le thadisitse ditsholofelo go Moporesitente Cyril Ramaphosa jaaka a tlhagelela kwa Khomišene ya Dipatlisiso ka ditatofatso tsa bosenyi mo pusong ka Laboraro, ba re ba batla gore Lekoko la Bosetšhaba la ANC le akgele ka ga Pholisi ya Setlhopha sa Bothapi.
DA leader John Steenhuisen says he will be attending this morning’s sitting of the commission to watch President Ramaphosa’s testimony.	Moeteledipele wa DA John Steenhuisen a re o tla bo a le teng mo mosong wa kopano ya Khomišene go lebelela Moporesitente Ramaphosa ’a neela bosupi.
Steenhuisen says the policy has allowed for state capture to continue for several years.	 Steenhuisen a re pholisi e letlelela bosenyi mo pusong  go tswelela dingwaga di le mmalwa.
We would like to get to the bottom of the cadre deployment policy.	Re rata go lebelela pholisi ya setlhopha sa bothapi ka leitlho le le ntšhotšho.
It has hollowed out the state and opened the door for state capture to take place in South Africa.	O gwaile naga le go bula kgoro ya bosenyi mo pusong go tsayakarolo mo Aforikaborwa.
A large part of the problem that we sit with is massive failures such as Eskom, SAA, Denel. Virtually every other SOE in the country is as a result of that policy.	Karolo e e kgolo ya bothata jo re bolebeletseng fela ke go retelelwa ga Eskom, SAA, Denel. Se se raya gore dikgwetlho tse naga e lebaneng le tsona ke ditiro tsa pholisi eo.
Meanwhile, the ANC has reiterated its support for the State Capture Commission ahead of President Ramaphosa’s appearance.	Re sa ntse re le foo, mokgatlho wa ANC o gateletse tebang le tshegetso ya ona mo Khomišene ya Dipatlisiso tsa bosenyi mo pusong ka ga go tlhagelela ga Moporesitente Ramaphosa.
ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa will finally appear before the State Capture Commission later this morning.	Moporesidente wa ANC Cyril Ramaphosa o tlaa tlhagelela kwa Khomišeneng Dipatlisiso tsa bosenyi mo pusong mo mosong.
Ramaphosa’s appearance before commission Chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo will be in two-parts.	Go tlhagelela ga ga Ramaphosa kwa Khomišeneng, Motlatsa Moatlhodimogolo Raymond Zondo o tla nna maphatha mabedi.
For the next two days, he will testify as the leader of the governing party and next month, will give evidence as the president of the country and the deputy president during the Jacob Zuma administration.	Mo malatsing a le mabedi a a latelang, o tlaa naya bosupi jaaka moeteledipele wa lekoko le le busang le mo kgweding e e tlang, o tla neela bosupi jaaka Poresidente wa naga le Motlatsa Moporesitente Jacob Zuma ka nako ya tsamaiso ya gagwe.
As ANC president, today and tomorrow, Ramaphosa will among others testify on what happened during his tenure as party deputy president, especially on his role as the Chairperson of the ANC Cadre Deployment Committee between 2013 and 2016.	Jaaka Moporesidente wa ANC, gompieno le ka moso, Ramaphosa o gareng ga ba bangwe o tlaa neela bosupi mabapi le se se diragetseng ka nako ya fa e ne e le Motlatsa Moporesidente, segolobogolo ka ga seabe sa gagwe jaaka modulasetulo wa Komiti ya Setlhopha sa Bothapi sa ANC magareng ga 2013 le 2016.

E ne e le maikarabelo a komiti go, gareng ga tse dingwe, go tlhopha baemedi ba setšhaba, bangwe ba bona e le ba go kaiwang ba ka nna mo gare ga ditiragalo tsa bosenyi mo pusong.
Lobby group, Afriforum had since applied to question Ramaphosa on his role as the chair of the committee.	Setlhopha sa bangoki, Afriforum se sa le se kopile go botsa Ramaphosa ka ga seabe sa gagwe jaaka modulasetulo wa komiti.
And after passing this hurdle, next month President Ramaphosa will face another gruelling cross examination on his role as the country’s second in command.

As former deputy president and now president of the country, Ramaphosa will, among others, try to rebut Brian Molefe’s testimony that he had been involved in state capture and the peddling of political influence for personal benefit.	Jaaka Motlatsamoporesitente wa maloba e bile jaaka Moporesidente wa naga Ramaphosa o tlaa, gareng ga tse ba bangwe, o leka go ganetsa bosupi jwa ga Brian Molefe jwa gore o nnile le seabe mo bosenying le go gweba ka tlhotlheletso ya sepolotiki go oketsa dikgetse tsa gagwe ka matlapa.
Molefe said Ramaphosa used his position as the country’s deputy president to protect and secure lucrative coal deals for mining giant Glencore after it gave him a stake and appointed him chairperson.	Molefe o rile Ramaphosa o dirisa maemo a gagwe jaaka motlatsamoporesidente go sireletsa le go babalela poelo e kgolo ya meepo ya malatlha a Glencore morago yam o modulasetulo.
He also said Ramaphosa and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan brought back loadshedding at Eskom when they took over in 2018, saying they forced out skilled executives as part of a ploy to collapse the power utility and pave the way for its privatisation.	O rile gape Ramaphosa le Tonakgolo ya Dikgwebo tsa Setšhaba, Pravin Gordhan ba gakaditse go kgaoga ga motlakase kwa Eskom fa ba ne ba tsaya marapho ka 2018, ba ntshitse bakhuduthamaga ba ba nang le bokgoni jaaka leano la go ya ka karolo ya leano la go phutlhamisa maatla a motlakase le go tlhagolela ditheo tse di ikemetseng tsela.

Tshwetso e e kaya gore maloko a ANC a a latofadiwang ka bonokwane go akaretswa le bosenyi ba tshwanetse go sekegwa go fitlha kgotlatshekelo e e konosetsa dikgetse tsa bona.
Party Secretary-General Ace Magashule is among those expected to step aside by the end of the month.	Mokwaledikakaretso Ace Magashule ke mongwe wa ba ba lebanweng ke go sekegwa mafelo a kgwedi.
Anything that seeks to divide the ANC needs careful management and what is of importance is for us in the leadership of the ANC to reflect on how we manage the implementation of resolutions.

Various ANC stakeholders have asked the party’s NEC to rethink the resolution, with some saying it should be suspended until at least the next ANC national conference or general council.

In an attempt to have Nomachule’s affidavit be found inadmissible, Gigaba’s lawyers had cited marital privilege as a reason why communications between the two should not be aired in public as well as the acrimonious nature of the couples on-going divorce proceedings.	Ka maiteko a go bona maikano a ga Nomachule a itlhokomolositswe, Babueledi ba kwa ga Gigaba ba tlhagisitse fa ditshwanelo tsa lenyalo e le lebaka le le dirileng gore tlhaeletsano magareng ga bobedi jo seke ya gasagasiwa mo pepeneneng gammogo le kgwetlho e banyalani ba kopanang le yona fa ba tlhalana.
Malusi ‘Gigaba’s lawyer Richard Solomons, argued, Communications that took place between Mr and Mrs Gigaba within the marital privilege context should not be aired in public.	Mmueledi wa ga Malusi Gigaba, Richard solomons, a re, ditlhaeletsano tse di diragetseng magareng ga Rre le Mme Gigaba mo bokaelong jwa ditshwanelo tsa lenyalo ga di a tshwanela go gasiwa mo phatlalatseng.
Secondly, we say because the acrimonious nature of the divorce proceedings, there is an inherent risk in the evidence and the veracity of the evidence that she will give and that will impact upon questions of credibility.

That is the first part to say I am unhappy with aspects of my affidavit for the reasons I have already announced and then she goes further to say that I come here with absolute respect for the commission and a civic duty I take very seriously.	Mo karolong ya ntlha ya re ga ke a itumelela pego e ke e ikanetseng ka ntlha ya mabaka a ke setseng ke a begile mme morago ga moo o ne a tswelela go bua gore ke tla fa ka tlotlo ya Khomišene le tiro ya semmuso e ke e tsayang tsia.
And she says, that being the case, I am married t to Mr Gigaba still.	Mme a re, le fa go le jalo, ke santse ke nyetswe ke Rre Gigaba.
She testified that a couple of months before Malusi became Public Enterprises Minister in October 2010, he told her that he had been told by Ajay Gupta he would get the position.	O neile bosupi gore dikgwedi pele Malusi a nna Tona ya Dikgwebo tsa Setšhaba ka kgwedi ya Diphalane 2010, o moreetse a re o lomilwe tsebe ke Aya Gupta gore o ka nna a neelwa maemo.
Responding to State Commission Evidence Leader Anton Myburgh, Nomachule says the frequency of his visits to the Gupta family’s Saxonwold home subsequently increased and he referred to the brothers as his unofficial advisors.	A fetola moeteledipele wa Dipatlisiso tsa Bosenyi mo pusong Anton Myburgh, Nomachule a re go boaboa  ga gagwe kwa ga Gupta kwa sabapong ya Saxonwold  go ne ga oketsega ka bonako e bile o ne a re barwa Gupata ke bagakolodi ba gagwe ba e seng ba semmuso.
He would differentiate them from the advisors that he had from the DPE, which I knew his legal advisor and Thami Msomi as well.	O ne a ka ba farologanya le bagakolodi ba gagwe go tswa kwa DPE, ke ne ke itse mogakolodi wa gagwe wa semolao le Thami Msomi sentle.
Asked by Myburg, did he tell you who these unofficial advisors were? Nomachule responded, yes, he told me.	A botswa ke Myburg, o go boleletse gore bagakolodi b aba gagwe ba e seng ba semolao ke bo mang? Nomachule o fetotse ka gore, ee, o mpoleletse.
Myburg further asked, what did he say? to which Nomachule responded, he had responded, It was the Guptas.	Myburg o tswelela ka go botsa, o ne a reng? Mme Nomachule o ne a re, ke boGupta.
Ajay and his brothers which I don’t know all by name.	Ajay le barwarragwe ba ke sa ba itseng botlhe ka maina.
I am only familiar with Ajay more than the other ones.	Ke itse fela Ajay go feta tse ba bangwe.
Nomachule said that Malusi Gigaba had told her that the Gupta brother had advised him about work, about things that they were supposed to do.	Nomachule o rile gore Malusi Gigaba o ne a mmolelela gore barwa Gupta bam o gakolotse ka tirro, ka ga dilo tse ba ne ba tshwanetse go di dira.
She says she was told by her husband that the Guptas did not like then-Eskom-CEO Brian Dames and wanted him replaced.	A re o ne a boleletswe ke monna wa gagwe gore ba ne ba sa rate CEO ya Eskom Brian Dames e bile ba ne ba batla go mo ntsha.
She says this was just one of a number of appointments that Malusi was told to make.	A re se ke dingwe tsa bothapi tse Malusi a neng a bolelelwa go di dira.
He told me that the Guptas did not like him and he did not understand why they did not like him and I think they told him there would be a new restructuring, someone else will move to Eskom, then Brian Dames will leave and I did not know how the process would happen.	O ne a mpoleletse gore ba ga Gupta ba ne ba sa mo rate mme ga a mpolelela gore goreng ba sa mo rate mme ke akanya gore ba mmoleletse fa go tlaa nna le diphetogo tse di ntšhwa, mongwe o tlaa ya kwa Eskom, Brian Dames o tla tlogela mme ke ne ke sa itse gore go ne ga diragalang.
A few months later it happened.	Morago ga dikgwedi di le mmalwa go diragetse.
Nomachule says Malusi received cash, various gifts and benefits from the Guptas over the years including a BMW and millions of rands to pay for the couples 2014 wedding and honeymoon.

She testified to seeing Malusi collecting bags of cash from the Gupta residence on a number of occasions, echoing the testimony of one of Malusi’s bodyguard in testimony to the commission.	O neetse bosupi fa a ne a bona Malusi a amogela mekotla ya madi go tswa go ba lelapa la ga Gupta makgetho a le mmalwa, o boeleditse bosupi jwa motlhokomedi wa ga Malusi kwa Khomišeneng.

The estranged wife of former Public Enterprises and Finance Minister, Malusi Gigaba, is giving the commission information about her husband’s dealings during his time in office.

Noma Gigaba received a summons to the inquiry after she declined to appear two weeks ago.	Noma Gigaba o ne a bidiwa kwa Khomišeneng ya dipatlisiso morago ga gore a gane go tlhagelela mo dibekeng tse pedi tse di fetileng.
Her lawyer Mpati Qofa read a letter by Gigaba where she raised her concerns about her treatment at the hands of the Commission evidence leaders, the contents of some of her submissions and her continued marital status.	Mmueledi wa gagwe Mpati Qofa o buisa lekwalo la ga Gigaba fa a ne a tlhagisa matshwenyego a gagwe mabapi le tsholo ya gagwe kwa baeteledipeleng ba Khomišene ba bopaki, diteng dingwe tsa ditlhagiso tsa gagwe le maemo a lenyalo.
Qofa says according to her client, parts of her affidavit to the Commission are inaccurate.	Qofa a re go ya ka mmuelelwa wa gagwe, o dirile phoso mo maikanong a gagwe kwa Khomišeneng.
Her husband, Malusi, tried stopping her from testifying, asking the commission to declare her affidavit inadmissible.	Monna wa gagwe, Malusi o lekile go mo kganela go neela bosupi, ka go kopa Khomišene go ikgatolosa maikano a gagwe.
However, the inquiry dismissed the bid and is due to hear his application to cross-examine Noma at a later stage.	Le fa go ntse jalo, kopo e ne ya seke ya sekegelwa tsebe le go utlwa ntlha ya gagwe ya kopo ya go botsolotsa Noma mo nakong e e tlang.
The State Capture Commission has rejected the application of former cabinet minister Malusi Gigaba that his estranged wife Nomachule’s affidavit be found inadmissible.	Khomišene ya Dipatlisiso tsa Bosenyi mo pusong e ganne kopo ya ga Tona wa maloba wa Kabinete Malusi Gigaba ya gore maikano a ga mogatse wa maloba Nomachule a ikgatolosiwe.
Malusi Gigaba’s lawyers had cited marital privilege as a reason why communications between the two should not be aired in public as well as the acrimonious nature of the couples on-going divorce proceedings.	Babueledi ba ga Malusi Gibaba ba umakile tshiamelo ya lenyalo jaaka lebaka le le dirang gore tlhaeletsano magareng ga bobedi jo e be e sa tshwanela go gasiwa mo pepeneneng gammogo le mofuta wa tlhalo ya bona e e santseng e tsweletse.
The former ministers lawyer Richard Solomons says Nomachule is a reluctant witness as summons have been issued against her to appear before the commission and that her testimony may not be accurate.	Mmueledi wa maloba wa ditona Richard solomons a re Nomachule ga a mo maemong a go paka jaaka gona le ditaelo kgatlhanong le ena go tlhagelela kwa Khomišeneng le gore bosupi jwa gagwe bo ka se ikanyege.

An application to cross-examine her will be held at another stage.	Kopo ya go mmotsolotsa e tlaa tshwarwa nako e e tlang.

Go ya ka mokgwa wa go ralala naga wa go isiwa bookelong, bontsi jwa diporofense di bontsha kwetlotlase kwa ntle ga diporofense tse pedi; Foreisetata e bontshitse koketsego ya diphesente di le 19 (19%) mo bekeng e e fetileng mme Kapa Bokone le yona e bontshitse tlhatlogonyana ya dipehesente di le 16 (16%) fa go bapisiwa le beke e e fetileng, o ne a bolela jalo.
Dr Suliman says while the positivity rate in South Africa is looking good, the country has to wait to see the impact of the Easter holidays.	Ngaka Suliman a re fa direiti tse diphosethifi mo Aforikaborwa di sa siame, naga ya rona e tshwanetse go emela go bona ditlamorago tsa malatsi a boikhutso a paseka.
Its looking quite good this past week, the number of new confirmed across the country is just over 1 000 on average per day and thats a decline of 8% compared to a week ago.	Go ne go lebega go siame mo bekeng e e fetileng, palo ya dikheisi tse di netefaditsweng go ralala naga di feta sekete ka palogare ka letsatsi mme se ke kwetlotlase ya diphesente di le robedi fa go bapisiwa le beke e e fitileng.
The seven-day average of just over 1 000 new cases is in fact the lowest its been since late May 2020.	Palogare ya go feta sekete sa dikgetse tse dintšhwa, e ile kwa tlase thata go feta ka tsela e e ne ntse ka bofelo jwa Moranang ka 2020.
With the recent easing of restrictions and the current holiday period, we will just have to wait and see if it will have any effect on the infection rates.	Go ya ka go nolofatswa ga melao le malatsi a boikhutso a bošeng jaana, re tlaa tshwanna ke go emela le go bona gore go tlaa nna le seabe mo palong ya go tshwaetsego.

The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture says it understands that the public wants it to complete its hearings and work but says an extension is needed to do it properly.	Khomišene ya Dipatlisiso ya puso ya re  e tlhaloganya gore setšhaba se batla gore e fetse ditheetso tsa yone le tiro mme ya re katoloso e a tlhokega go dira dilo sentle.
The Commission announced on Thursday morning it would be applying to the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria for a three month extension of its deadline.	Khomišene e dirile kitsiso ka Labone mo mosong gore e ya go dira kopo ya katoloso ya dikgwedi di le tharo tsa letlha le le beilweng la yona kwa kgotlatshekelo e e kwa godimo ya kwa Bokone Gauteng kwa Pretoria.

The Commission was supposed to have finished oral hearings by the end of last month.	Khomišene e ne e tshwanetse go fetsa ditheetso tsa molomo ka mafelo a kgwedi e e fetileng.
DCJ says the commission will still continue to hear the evidence of other 5or 6 implicated witnesses including the evidence of the President in his capacity as the President of ANC and the President of the country.	DCJ a re khomišene e tlaa nna e tswelelapele ka go utlwa bosupi jwa dipaki le tlhano kgotsa thataro tse di amegang, go akaretsa bosupi jwa Moporesidente mo tirong ya gagwe ya go nna Moporesidente wa ANC le Moporesitente wa naga.
Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo says the extension is important given that they have to hear evidence from another six implicated people including President Cyril Ramaphosa.	 Motlatsa Moatlhodimogolo Raymond Zondo a re katoloso e botlhokwa ka gore ba tshwanetse go utlwa bosupi go tswa mo bathing ba bangwe ba ba amegang ba le thataro go akaretsa Moporesidente Cyril Ramaphosa.
But the one thing I will not do is this, I will not end the work of the Commission in an irresponsible manner.	Mme selo se le sengwe se nka se sedireng ke se, nka se feleletse tiro ya Khomišene ka mokgwa o sa siamang.
I am going to repeat that, I will not end the work of the Commission in an irresponsible manner, just because I want to satisfy those that demand that the Commission should finish its work.	Ke tlile go boeletsa gore nka se feleletse tiro ya Khomišene ka mokgwa o sa siamang, fela ka gore ke batla kgotsofatsa bao ba batlang  gore Khomišene e tshwanetse go fetsa tiro ya yona.
When [we] started at this Commission, I made it quite clear that this Commission would do its work properly.	Fa re ne re simolola Khomišene eno, ke dirile gore go utlwagale sentle gore Khomišene e, e tlaa dira tiro ya yona ka tshwanelo.
In seeking to complete hearings of oral evidence we will act properly and in [a] responsible manner, adds Zondo.	Mo go batleng go tlatsa ditheetso tsa bosupi jwa molomo, re tla dira tshwanelo le ka maikarabelo, a bolela jalo Zondo.
Today’s proceedings below.	Tatelano ya ditiragalo tsa gompieno fa tlase.
The Judicial Commission of Inquiry into allegations of State Capture is to apply to the High Court this afternoon for an extension of its hearings.

The assessment that was made was made in good faith but it just did not work out.	Tshekatsheko e e dirilweng e dirilwe ka tshwanelo tumelo mme gagwa direga jalo.
The evidence that still needed to be heard beyond the end of March was very important evidence, it included the evidence of former senior executives of SOEs such as Transnet and Eskom.	Bosupi bo bo neng bo tlhokega go reediwa go feta bokhutlong jwa kgwedi ya Mopitlwe bo ne bo le botlhokwa thata, bo ne bo akaretsa bosupi jwa bokhuduthamaga ba maloba ba di SOEs jaaka Transnet le Eskom.
DCJ says the commission did not have hearings recently and that its term will come to an end at the end of June, he says when the commission applied for the extension from the end of March to the end of June.	DCJ a re Khomišene e ne e se na ditheetso bošeng jaana mme paka ya yona e tlaa khutla kwa bokhutlong jwa kgwedi ya Seetebosigo, a re fa Khomišene e ne e dira kopo ya katoloso ya go tswa kwa bokhutlong jwa kgwedi ya Mopitlwe go ya kwa bokhutlong jwa kgwedi ya Seetebosigo.
The Commission resumed today with oral evidence from former Transnet CFO Anoj Singh and will also hear evidence from former public enterprise minister Malusi Gigaba tonight.

Zondo this week announced that the Commission has limited time to wrap up its oral evidence and dismissed most of the applications for leave to cross-examine.	Zondo beke e, o begile gore Khomišene e na le nako e e  tlhomilweng go konosetsa bosupi jwa molomo mme ya koba bontsi jwa dikopo tsa go tlogela go botsolotsa.
Some political parties say there is nothing to celebrate this Youth Day if more than 60% of young people are unemployed and trapped in poverty.	Makoko a mang a sepolotiki a re ga go na sepe se se ka ketekelwang Letsatsi la Bašwa lena, fa go na le diphesente di ka feta 60(%) tsa bašwa ba ba sa direng e bile ba katlilwe mo lehumeng.
Exactly 45 years ago on this day, thousands of young people took to the streets to protest the mandatory use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction in Black schools.	Ke di ngwaga di le 45 tse di fetileng ka letsatsi le, fa dikete tsa bašwa ba ne ba ya  go dira ditshupetso tsa tiriso ya taolelo ya go rutwa ka mo dikolong tsa bantsho ka puo ya Seburu.
Many of them were killed, some were arrested while others including their leader Tsietsi Mashinini, went into exile.	Bontsi jwa bona ba ne ba bolawa, bangwe ba tshwarwa fa ba bangwe ba bona go akarediwa le moeteledipele wa bona Tsietsi Mashinini ba ne ba ya botshabelo.
Until 1994, many of them were killed in the struggle against the apartheid oppressive regime, while hundreds of those who left the country, joined liberation armies of the African National Congress (ANC), Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) and Azanian Peoples Organisation (Azapo).	Go fitlha ka 1994, bontsi jwa bona ba ne ba bolawa mo kgaratlhong kgatlhanong le puso ya kgatelelo ya tlhaolele, mme fa makgolokgolo a ba bangwe ba tlogela naga, ba tsenelena sesole sa tokologo sa African National Congress (ANC), (Pan Africanist Congress ya Azania (PAC) le Azanian People’s Organisation (Azapo).
Decades later, some political parties say life is still tough for young people even under the democracy,citing unemployment and their daily struggle to overcome poverty.	Morago ga dingwagasome di le dintsi, makoko a mang sepolotiki a re botshelo bo sa ntse bo le thata mo bašweng le ka fa tlase temokerasi, go lebilwe botlhokatiro le botlhoki jwa bona ba go fenya kgaratlho ya bone ya letsatsi le letsatsi.

Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema, has appealed to the youth of South Africa not to give up and to continue to educate themselves.	Moeteledipele wa Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Julius Malema, o kopile baša ba Aforikaborwa gore ba se ka ba itlhoboga mme tswelepele ka go ithuta.
Malema was speaking at Horskool Uitsig in Centurion, Pretoria, in commemoration of the June 1976 student uprising.	Malema o a ne a bua kwa sekolong se se golo sa Uitsig kwa Centurion, Pretoria, go gopola dikhuduego tsa baithuti ba 1976 Seetebosigo.
He says education is the key to success and therefore the youth must grab that opportunity.	A re thuto ke senotlele sa katlego mme ka jalo bašwa ba tshwanetse go dirisa tšhono eo.
Malema says the youth should draw inspiration from the likes of the late struggle icon, Hector Pieterson, who died this day in 1976.	Malema a re bašwa ba tshwanetse go tsaya thotloetso go tswa go mothosetšhabeng wa kgaratlho jaaka Hector Pieterson yo a tlhokafetseng, ka letsatsi le ka 1976.
He left us with enough material to revive us, to equip us, to inspire us as Black people and to continue the good fight.	O re sile ka kitso e e a lekaneng gore re itsosolose, re ithute, le go retlhotlheletsa jaaka batho ba bantsho le go tsweletsa go lwela se se siameng.
We are not the type that will just sit back and say we complain, thats not why we are here.	Ga re batho ba go nna fela mme re ngongorega, ga se ka mogo re leng fano.
We are here to say to every White man, there is a place for every Black person in South Africa including here, he says.	Re fano go bolelela basweu, gore motho mongwe le mongwe yo montsho o na le lefelo mo Aforikaborwa go akarediwa le fano, o ne a bolela jalo.
The EFF leader says Petersons death must be solely blamed on former South African Prime Minister, John Vorster.	Go ya ka moeteledipele wa EFF, tonakgolo ya maloba ya Aforikaborwa John Vorster, o tshwanetswe go supiwa ka monwana mo losong la ga Pietersons.
He says Vorster presided over the death of many young people in the country, for merely fighting for their rights as young people.	A re Vorster o na le seabe mo dintshong tse dintsi tsa bašwa ba bantsi mo nageng, fela go lwela ditshwanelo tsa bona jaaka batho ba bašwa.
They don’t repeat the name, they don’t hypnotise you with the name of a murder who killed our people in 1976.	Ga ba boeletse leina, ga ba laole mogolo wa gago ka leina la motho yo a ne a bolaya batho ba rona ka 1976.
John Vorster is responsible for 1976, John Vorster is responsible for the murder of Hector Peterson.	John Vorster o na le maikarabelo a 1976, John Vorster o na le maikarabelo a polao ya ga Hector Peterson.
And AKK those who came after him, because they did not prosecute him they too have got blood of Hector Peterson, he told EFF supporters.	Le ba AKK ba ba tlileng morago ga gagwe, le bone ba na le madi a Hector Peterson mo diatleng tsa bone ka gonne ga ba mo otlhaya, o ne a bolelela batshegetsi ba EFF.

Vaccine woes.	Dikhutsafalo tsa Moento.
Malema also touched on the countrys vaccine challenges.	Malema o buile gape ka dikgwetlho tsa meento mo nageng.
He says his party will picket outside the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) headquarters in Pretoria on Friday next week.	A re lekoko la gagwe le tlile go dira ditshupetso kwa ntle ga mošate wa South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) kwa Pretoria ka Labotlhano mo bekeng e e tlang.
It will be demanding that the Chinese vaccine and that of Russia be approved for use in South Africa.	E tlaa bo e batla gore moento kwa China le wa kwa Russia, e letlelelwe go ka diriswa mo Aforikaborwa.
He says the delay by government in driving the vaccination process is going to cost a lot of lives.	A re tiego ya puso mo go tsamaisong ya go tlhaba meento, e tlile go dira gore bontsi jwa batho ba latlhegelwe ke matshelo.
The EFF leader says should they not be happy, they will stage a sit-in at the house of SAHPRA CEO, Dr Boitumelo Semete-Makokotlela until their call is headed.	Moeteledipele wa EFF a re fa ba sa itumela, ba tlile go dira kgato ya go nna kwa ntle ga ntlu motlhankedimogolo wa SAHPRA, Ngaka Boitumelo Semete-makokotlela go fitlhela ba ba reetsa.
After picketing there next week Friday, they have seven days to approve the Russian vaccine and the Chinese vaccine, failure to do so, were do stage a sleep in at the house of the CEO of SAHPRA until they protect us, it is personal like that.	Morago ga go dira ditshupetso kwa ntle beke e e tlang ka Labotlhano, ba na le malatsi a le supa go amogela moento wa kwa Russia le moento wa China, go retelelwa ke go dira jalo, re a go dira kgato ya go robala kwa ntle ga ntlu ya motlhankedimogolo wa SAHPRA go fitlhela ba resireletsa, e re ama jalo.
It is personal like that.	E re ama jalo.
We are going to her house, we want her to approve Sputnik and Chinese vaccine to add on what we have now, he says.	Re tlile go ntlo ya gagwe, re batla go amogela sputnik le Setšhaena moento go tlaleletsa mo go se re se na jaanong, o bolela jalo.
South Africa is currently using the Johnson and Johnson and the Pfizer vaccine is the second phase of its vaccination programme.	Aforikaborwa ga jaanong jana e dirisa Johnson le Johnson mme moento wa Pfizer ke wa kgato ya bobedi ya go tlhaba meento.
The young people of South Africa are in a permanent state of depression and hopelessness.	Bašwa ba Aforikaborwa ba mo maemong a kgatelelo ya semowa a leruri le go itlhoboga.
Largely because we have given up the baton.	Thata thata ka gonne re itlhobogile maikarabelo.
All revolutions across the world were led by decisive, united and radical young people.	Ditshupo tsotlhe tsa go kgabakanya lefatshe, di ne di eteletswe pele ke bašwa ba ba neng ba dirisana mmogo, mme ba na le bokgoni jwa go dira ditshwetso tse di botlhokwa ka bonako.
The fact that our country is in a speedy state of demise is one that cannot be argued anymore.	Ntlha ya gore naga ya rona e mo maemong a latlhegelwa ke go laola naga ka lebelo ke ntlha e e re ka se e ganetseng.
The rate of youth unemployment speaks volumes.	Palo ya botlhokatiro jwa bašwa bua go le gontsi thata.
This dizzying 46.3% unemployment rate of young people was coming  COVID-19 or not.	Palo e ya 46.3% e e golang ka bokano ya botlhokatiro jwa bašwa e ne e tlile go nna teng le fa Covid-19 e ne sa nna teng.
Savanna and the Yanos (culture of excessive youth partying) have taken over, the revolution is happening there.	Savanna le ma Yanos (setso sa bašwa se se feteletseng sa meletlo) se e etelapele mme diphetogo tsotlhe di diragala teng.
But what about the realities that will still remain even after a night of groove?	Mme ra re eng ka maemo a ka metlha a a sa fetogeng ka fa morago ga go itumedisa bosigo kwa menateng?
The true liberation of this country will not happen for as long as we are still stuck in the delusion of drunkenness and twerking.	Kgololosego ya nnte ya naga e, e ka se diragale fa re sa ntse re belwa ke go iphora ka botagwa le mmino wa matheka le marago.
As we commemorate the 45th anniversary of the Soweto massacre, which has been renamed	Jaaka re keteka ngwaga wa bo 45 wa go gokologelwa kgailo ya bašwa kwa Soweto, e e kileng ya fetolwang leina go nna Letsatsi la Bašwa go lekwa go phefofatswa nnete ya se se diragetseng letsatsi leo, bašwa ba mo Aforikaborwa ba tshwanetse go fetola tsela e ba akanyang ka yona ka bonako mme ba tseye tiro ya Bašwa ya go lwela tokologo ya konomi ka bo bona.
Notwithstanding the fact that, as youth, we are within a permanent stage of depression and hopelessness, our brothers and sisters need to realise that no one is going to come to our rescue.	Go sa kgathalasege ntlha ya gore, jaaka bašwa, re mo kgatong ya leruri ya kgatelelo ya semowa le go itlhoboga, bo morrwarra le bo kgaitsadi ba rona ba tshwanetse go lemoga gore ga go ope yo o tlang go ba golola.
We have given too much power to old political careerists to destroy our future.	Re neile batsofe ba sepolotiki ba nang le taba fela le di porofešene tsa bone tsa sepolotiki maatla a mantsi go ripitla bokamoso jwa rona.
These people are busy building and cementing their careers and in doing so, they will make sure that young people do not emerge because they know clearly that once we take power  we will make sure that all criminals rot in jail.	Batho ba ba tshwaragane le go aga le go tlhabolola di porofešene tsa bone mme ka go dira jalo, ba tlile go netefatsa gore bašwa ga ba tswelepele ka ntlha ya gore ba itse sentle gore fa re tsaya maatla ao, re tlile go  netefatsa gore dasenyi botlhe ba bolela kwa kgolegelong.
The future belongs to us.	Bokamoso mo diatleng tsa rona.
All our current leaders will not be with us on earth in 2063.	Baeteledipele botlhe ba rona ba jaanong ba tlabe ba sena le rona mo lefatsheng ka 2063.
We are the ones who will have to account to the next generations as to why did we allow criminals to lead us and destroy the future.	Ke rona ba re tlaa bong re tshwanetse go tlhalosetsa kokomana e e tlang gore, goreng go etelela pele le go ripitla bokamoso jwa rona ke basinyi ba.
COVID, a blessing	COVID, lesego
The COVID-19 pandemic has been a blessing in disguise for young people in the country as it necessitated the urgency of technological adoption and integration into our lives.	Leroborobo la COVID-19 e nnile selo se re neng re sa se solofelang mo go bašweng bathong ba mo nageng e, ka fa e dirile batho ba itlwaetse le amogela tiriso ya thekenoloji ka bonako mo matshelong a rona.
The old generation is still struggling with even clicking a link to join a virtual meeting.	Kokomana ya bogologolo e sa ntse ba gakantshwa tobetsa kgolagano go tsenela kopano ka khomputara.
This is a field for young people to play in.	Le ke lefolo le baša ba tshwanetdeng go e tshamekelang teng.
Let us forget the obsession of looking for jobs because that was relevant until the end of the third industrial revolution.	A re lebaleng ka go itshwenya ka go batla tiro ka gonne, se ne se le maleba go fitlha kwa bokhutlong jwa   diphetogo tsa boraro tsa bodiredi.
This fourth revolution requires us to be innovative and bring about sustainable solutions.	Phetogo ya bone e batla gore re kgone go dira le go tlisa ditharabololo tse di tswelelangpele.
As the electoral system opens for individual candidates, young people should be ready to run for all positions, even if it means challenging a pensioner of a political organisation that you belong in.	Jaaka thulaganyo ya go dira ditlhopho e Bulelwa mang le mang, baša ba tshwanetse go nna ba e kemiseditse tsamaisa  maemong otlhe, le fa e kaya e re e gwetlha motsofe wa mokgatlho wa sepolotiki se o leng mo go sona.
We need to declare ageism an enemy in public service and government.	Re tlhoka go bua kgobelelo ya bagodi jaaka sera sa mo tirelong setšhaba le puso.
The time for young people is now!	Nako ya baša ke yona e.
I do not believe that when Solomon Mahlangu said we should continue the struggle he meant that we should do exactly what we saw destroying him.	Ga ke dumele gore fa Solomon Mahlangu a ne a re, re tshwanetse go tswelelapele ka go lwela kgaratlho o ne a sa re, re dire seo se mmolaileng.
The enemy we are facing today does not have a specific colour.	Mmaba o re lebaganeng le ene gompieno ga a na le mmala o o rileng.
We need to contest power and challenge ageism everywhere.	Re tlhoka go ya go lwela kgaisano ya maatla le go gwetlha sa tshwareng kgobelelo ya bagodi gongwe le gongwe.
The only way to win is to forcefully and strategically contest and take power.	Tsela fela ya go fenya ke go pateletsa le go loga maono a kgaisano gore ke kgone go busa.
We are dreaming if we think that we are going to be given space by the same people who are responsible for our suffering.	Ga re akanye sentle fa re solofela gore re tlile go fiwa sebaka ke batho ba ba nang le maikarabelo a go sotlega ga rona.
We need to take up space forcefully and strategically so, not by destroying the little that we have.	Re tlhoka go tsaya sebaka ka go pateletsa le ka go loga maono, e seng ka go senya dilo tse re nang le tsona.
Young people are capable, singayisusa nomanini na!	Baša ba na le bokgoni, ba ka simolola ntwa nako engwe le engwe fa ba batla. singayisusa.

Already the President had said youth unemployment is governments biggest concern.	Moporesidente o setse a buile gore botlhokatiro jwa bašwa ke tlhababoroko e kgolo ya puso.

It painted a dull picture with the official unemployment rate growing to a record high of 32,6 percent.	E tlhagisitse setshwantsho se se sa itumediseng sa rekoto ya semmuso ya botlhokatiro e e kwa godimo ka diperesente di le 32,6.
The population group with the highest unemployment rate is the youth, with 63,3 percent of people between the ages of 15 and 24 being unemployed, and 41,3 percent for the age group 25 and 34.

The events, which triggered that uprising in South Africa, can be traced back to policies of the apartheid government that resulted in the introduction of the Bantu Education Act in 1953.	Ditiragalo tse di simolotseng dikhuduego tsa mo Aforikaborwa, di ka bonwa go tswa go dipholisi tsa puso ya tlhaolele e e dirileng tlhagiso ya Molao wa Thuto ya Bantsho ka 1953.
The rise of the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) and the formation of the South African Students Organisation (SASO) raised the political consciousness of many students, with others joining the older guard political parties of the time.	Tsibogo ya Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) le go tlhamiwa ga Mokgatlho wa Baithuti wa (South African Student Organisation- SASO) e tsositse go ithuta ka dipolitiki ga baithuti ba le bantsi, go kopana le ba bangwe ka go itisa makoko a sepolotiki.
When the apartheid government forced Afrikaans alongside English as a compulsory medium of instruction in schools in 1974, young Black learners began to mobilise.	Fa puso ya tlhaolele e ne pateletsa tiriso ya Seaforikanse le Seesemane go nna dipuo tsa go ruta kwa dikolong ka 1974, baithuti ba bašwa ba bantsho ba simolotse go bolotsa letsholo.
On 16 June 1976, between 3 000 and 10 000 students mobilised by the South African Students Movements Action Committee supported by the BCM marched peacefully to demonstrate and protest against the governments directive.	Ka di 16 Seetebosigo 1976, baithuti ba ka na 3 000 go ya go 10 000 ba  tlhotlhelediwa ke mokgatlho wa baithuti wa South African Students Movements Action Committee Aforikaborwa ya Komiti ya tiro e e tshegediwang ke BCM ba ne ba gwanta ka kagiso go bontsha le ngongorego kgatlhanong le dipuso kgakololo.
While some of them lost their lives, others lived to tell the tale and are serving in various sectors of the countrys economy.	Fa ba bangwe ba bone ba kile ba latlhegelwa ke matshelo a bona, ba bangwe ba kile ba kgona go tshela mme ba kgona go tlhalosa se diragetseng e bile ba dira mo maphateng a a farologaneng a ikonomi ya naga.
As the country reflects on the events of that day and the victory that followed, SABC Digital News highlights three of the many leaders who emerged from the uprising.	Jaaka naga e gopola ditiragalo tsa letsatsi leo le phenyo e e nnileng teng, Dikgang tsa maratlhatlha tsa  SABC di tlhagisa baeteledipele ba bararo ba kileng ba tlhagelela go tswa mo dikhuduegong.

Al Jamah still feels today that we are in a war situation.	Al Jamah o sa ntse a utlwa re sa le mo ntweng le gompieno.
For the past year, we supported the president with regards to each time of extending the state of Disaster, and we still supporting the President wherever we can.

We are now in the third wave and people are dying like flies.	Jaanong re mo kgatong ya boraro ya phudugelo mme batho ba swa jaaka dintsi.
And we feel that the President must ignore the official opposition party (DA) and focus on only saving lives.	Mme re dumela gore Moporesidente a sa reetsa lekokokganetso la semmuso (DA) mme a tlhome mogopolo wa gagwe fela mo go bolokeng matshelo.
And he shouldn’t worry about saving livelihoods because we are in a war situation.	Mme a sa tshwenyega ka ga go boloka matseno a batho, ka gonne re ne re le mo ntweng.
We cannot let lives be lost just to save an extra job or two.	Re ka se kgone go letlela batho ba latlhegelwa ke matshelo fela go boloka tiro kgotsa ditiro tsa bone.
So, Al Jamah’s position is that there should be a complete lockdown that we must move to level five, maybe just for a week or two, and secondly, there must be a complete alcohol ban because it has been proven that alcohol is causing much harm.	Ka jalo Jamah o bona go tshwanetse gore re nne mo kgatong ya botlhano ya go sekega nakwana ditiro tsa fa nageng, gongwe fela ka beke kgotsa tse pedi, mme sa bobedi, ke gore go netefatswe gore thekeiso ya bojalwa ga ya letlelelwa ka ntlha ya gore nnotagi e tlisa kotsi e ntsi thata.
And the President has given into the captains of the wine industry and that was the big mistake.	Mme Moporesidente o reeditse balaedi ba bodirelo jwa beine mme seo e ne e le phoso e kgolo.
We also feel that there must be a ban on cigarettes just like it was in level five.	Gape re akanya gore go tshwanetse ga nna thibelo ya thekiso ya disekerete fela jaaka e ne e le teng mo kgatong ya botlhano.
So we are in a war situation and we need to throw everything at defeating the pandemic, says Hendricks.	Hendricks a re, re mo ntweng, ka jalo re tlhoka go dira sengwe le sengwe se se ka fenyang leroborobo le.

In court papers, Matinisa says all youth league structures, including those in provinces, lapsed some years ago and that there are some members of the structures who are now older than 35.	Mo dipamiring tsa kwa kgotlatshekelo, Matinisa a re, go ditheo tsotlhe tsa bašwa mo diporofenseng tseo, go fedile ka tsone dingwaga di le mmalwa tsa go feta mme go sa na le ditokololo tse dingwe tsa ditheo tseo tsa dingwaga tsa go feta 35.

That’s where I’m asking ANC clarity of how can you say people over 35 must excuse themselves in NYTT, but when it comes to provinces you don’t do the same.	Ke ka mo ke botsang ANC gore e tlhalose gore, goreng bare batho ba ba fetang 35 ba tswe mo NYTT, mme fa go tliwa mo diporofenseng ga ba dire jalo?

I got vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine on the 7th of June and today on the 11th of June, I am doing oversight visit in Gauteng.	Ke entilwe ka moento wa Pfizer k di 7 tsa Seetebosigo mme gompieno ka di 11 tsa Seetebosigo, ke a go etela kwa Gauteng.
I feel ok.	Ke ikutlwa ke siame.
I have never had any side effects.	Ga ke ise ke nne le ditlamorago
Even on the same day of my vaccination, I drove myself home.	Tota le ka letsatsi la ntlha la me la go entiwa, ke kgweditse go ya kwa gae.
I am encouraging all those who are 60 years and above to go for all those life-saving interventions by the Department of Health.	Ke rotloetsa batho botlhe ba dingwaga di le 60 le go feta, go ya kwa dikopanong tsa Lefapha la Boitekanelo tsa go bolaka matshelo.
Dhlomo is encouraging those who experience side effects from the vaccine to act quickly.	Dhlomo o rotloetsa batho ba ba nnang maitemogelo a ditlamorago tse di bakwang ke moento gore ba batle thuso ka bonako .
If you do feel any symptoms of dizziness, tiredness, itchiness of the body, report those as soon as you can.	Fa o utlwa o kare o nna le matshao jaaka sedidi, molapo, gobaba mo mmeleng, a bege ka bonako.  ikutlwa le matshwao a motsikitlelo, tiredness, itchiness tsa mmele, go bega ba ka bonako jaaka o kgona.

I am visiting sights here in Gauteng.	Ke e tela mafelo mo Gauteng.
I am actually happy that I got vaccinated in the most rural part of Kwazulu Natal called Mbumbulu.	Ke itumetse tota gore ke amogetse moento wa me mo karolong e nngwe ya motse legae wa KwaZulu-Natal Natal o o bidiwang Mbumbulu.
And we are grateful to the Department that continues to give us support, even in other rural parts of the country despite the challenges of this vaccine.	Mme re leboga Lefapha le le tswelangpele ka go re ema nokeng, tota le fa dikarolong tse dingwe tsa magaeng tsa naga le fa gona le dikgwetlho tsa moento o.

Tsenoli was vaccinated at a Cape Town hospital on Wednesday morning.	Tsenoli o entilwe kwa bookelong kwa Kapa ka Laboraro mo mosong.
Today is my second morning following getting the vaccination, and I am feeling great.	Gompieno ke letsatsi la me la bobedi mo mosong morago ga go tlhabiwa ka moento, mme ke ikutlwa ke siame.
I went there confident that I could handle a needle, which is one thing that I dont fear.	Ke ile kwa teng ke na le maikemisetso a gore ke tlaa emela lemao, ka e le sengwe se ke sa se tshabeng.
I do acupuncture, so the needle does not scare me anyway.	Ke dira acupuncture, ka jalo lemao ga le ntshose.
So, its been great that the Department of Health has been rolling out this programme in the way it does throughout the country.	Ka jalo, go a itumedisa gore Lefapha la Boitekanelo le ntse le dira lenaneo le ka tsela e le ntseng le dira ka teng go ralala naga.
And that I personally have now gotten it, has somewhat lifted my confidence.	Mme ka gore ke setse ke amogetse moento wame, se se dirile gore ke nne le  boikanyo.
I didn’t actually realise that I was anxious to get it.	Tota ke ne ke sa lemoge gore ke ne ke tlhobaelwa go e fitlhela.
Now that I got it I feel upbeat and its been great.	Jaanong ka gore ke e fitlhetse, ke ikutlwa ke na le tsholofelo mme go ntse go itumedisa.
I haven’t felt anything untoward that I cant handle.	Ga ke iseke ke utlwi sepe se se sa siamang se ke sa kgoneng go se kgotlhelela.
The Deputy Speaker says he is happy to contribute towards the much-needed population immunity in the fight against COVID-19.	Motlatsa Mmusakgotla a re o itumeletse go nna le seabe mo tshoutong e e tlhokegang thata ya setšhaba kgatlhanong le ntwa ya covid-19.
I wish others can have the courage to go ahead and do it as well.	Ke eletsa gore batho ba ka nna le bopelokgale jwa go tswelela mme ba tlhabe moento.
It is necessary to at least take the first step as a preventative step, so that the second one when it comes, must add to the immunity my body requires to withstand any attack on the virus.	Go botlhokwa go ka tsaya kgato ya ntlha jaaka e le kgato ya go thibela gore fa kgato ya bobedi e fitlha, o tshwanetse go oketsa tshouto ke se ka tlhoka go emelana le tlhaselo ka mogare.
At my age, I need my health to be the best it can be and I guess also that I contribute to general immunity in the population.	Ka dingwaga tsa me, ke tlhoka go itekanela thata mme ke tshepa se se ka thusa mo tshoutong ya setšhaba  ka kakaretso.
Tsenoli says he is one of the high-risk vulnerable groups.	Tsenoli a re ke o mongwe wa setlhopha sa batho ba boitekanelo ba bona bo leng bokoa.
I do have comorbidity	Ga ka itekanela mo mmeleng.
but I am glad that some of the colleagues have done so too.	Mme ke itumelela gore bangwe ba baridimmogo ba me ba dirile jalo.
A friend also sent me a message from Durban.	Tsala enngwe ya me e e tswang kwa Durban eng rometse molaetsa.
He went to the church in the neighbourhood which was used as a base.	O ile kwa kerekeng mo motseng e e neng e dirisiwa jaaka motheo.
He too was very excited when he sent me the message and appreciated the settings in the province in Umlazi in different places for the over 60, to be able to go and get their injections next to where they live.	O ne a itumetse thata fa a ne ang nromela molaetsa mme a re o itumelela tsamaiso ya mafelo a a farologaneng a go entwa mo porofenseng mo Umlazi mo batho ba gofeta dingwaga di feta 60 ba yang teng, go fitlhela meento ya bona teng gaufi le mo ba nnang teng.
Its a great initiative, I think.	 Ke akanya gore ke tongamaano e e  siameng.
It makes for the necessity to combat the disease so that we can get as close to living our normal lives as we can.	Go botlhokwa go lwantsha bolwetse gore re tle re kgone go ka tswela pele ka matshelo a rona gape jaaka re ne re tlwaetse.
However, we need to be patient.	Le gale, re tshwanetse go nna pelotelele.
This requires as many of us to (vaccinate).	Se se tlhoka gore bontsi jwa rona re (entiwe).
Tsenoli also reflected on those who knowingly spread the coronavirus.	Tsenoli o buile gape ka bao ba ba phasalatsang coronavirus.
Two people were fired.	Batho ba le babedi ba ne ba kobiwa ke batlhankedi.
Their case was that they knowingly went to places of work with COVID-19 and therefore this was dangerous to other people they worked with.	Kgetse ya bona e ne e le gore ba ile kwa mafelo tirong ba ntse ba itse gore ba na le Covid-19 mme se se ne e sele kotsi go batho ba bangwe ba ne ba dira le bona.
The court found against them and so decided that the employer was within their right to fire them.	Kgotlatshekelo e ne ya ba fitlhela ba le molato mme ya bona se se dirileng ke bathapi se le mo molaong.
So we have to be conscious that there are consequences for acting irresponsibly when we do know we have COVID to go and join crowds and other places where we should not be and thus spreading the virus.	Ka jalo re tshwanetse go tlhokomela gore go na le ditlamorago fa o se na maikarabelo o itse gore o na le COVID mme o ya kwa mafelong a a matshwititshwiti le mafelo a re sa tshwanelang go yak wa go o ne mme re phatlhalatsa mogare.
Its dangerous, its not worth it.	E kotsi, ga e busetse sepe.
Not all of us have the health ability to withstand disease and so we place many people at risk.	Ga se botlhe ba re nang le boitekanelo jwa go fenya bolwetse jo mme ka jalo re baya batho ba le bantsi mo kotsing.
Its a simple human action when we comply with the restrictions of staying out of crowds and limiting any interaction with a broad big numbers of people.	Yona ke kgato e e bonolo ya batho fa re ka obamela ditaolo tsa go se ye kwa matshwititshwiting a batho le go lekanyetsa dikgonagano tsa dipalo tse dikgolo tsa batho.
It is also appropriate that we sanitise, wash our hands and ensure that we keep our masks,- covering our noses which is not what usually happens in certain instances.	Gape go botlhokwa gore re dirise sebolayamegare, re tlhape diatla tsa rona le go netefatsa gore re apere dimaseke tsa rona, - tse di bipang dinko tsa rona ka ge e se ka gale e diragala mo mabakeng a a rileng.
But largely many people do comply and its great.	Mme ke batho ba le bantsi ba ba latelang melao e mme go gontle.
DA National Spokesperson Siviwe Gwarube says some of the partys 23 MPs who are over the age of 60 have also been vaccinated.	Mmueledi wa Bosetšhaba wa DA Siviwe Gwarube a re maloko a mangwe go tswa mo malokong a le 23 a lekoko ba ba fetang dingwaga di le 60 ba entilwe.
Many of them are looking forward to getting their jabs and they are looking forward to leading by example by getting their jabs.	Bontsi jwa bona ba itumeletse go fitlhela meento ya bone mme ba labile go etelelapele ka go tlhoma bokao ka go bona meento.
A number of them have already had their first jab and will be waiting to get their second jabs as part of the vaccinations process.	Palo e e rileng ya bona e setse e bone moento wa ntlha mme ba tlile go emela moento wa bobedi wa bone jaaka e le karolo ya thulaganyo ya meento.
It is once again disappointing that the vaccination process is not as fast as it should be, simply because we know that it is the only way that we can cushion ourselves against the impact of the third wave and we encourage all people who are over the age of 60, who are health care-workers to get their vaccinations as quickly as possible as quickly as they can.	Gwa swabisa gape gore tsamaiso ya meento ga e tsamaye ka bonako jaaka go ne go tshwanetse , fela ka gore re a itse gore ke yone fela tsela ya gore re ka itshireletsa kgatlhanong le kgato ya boraro ya leroborobo mme re rotloetsa batho botlhe ba ba dingwaga tse di fetang 60, ba e leng badiri ba pholo go bona meento ka bonako jo bo kgonagalang.
Other Members of Parliament over the age of 60 who have registered to be vaccinated, include United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa, Congress of the People (Cope) leader, Mosioua Lekota and former Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi.	Ditokololo tse dingwe tsa palamente ba dingwaga tsa go feta 60 ba ba kwadisitsweng go entiwa, ba akaretsa moeteledipele wa United Democratic Movement (UDM) Bantu Holomisa, moeteledipele wa Congress of the People (Cope) Mosioua Lekota, le moeteledipele wa maloba wa Inkatha Freedom Party, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
Holomisa says he is still waiting to receive his notification.	Holomisa a re o santse a letile go amogela kitsiso ya gagwe.
I confirm that I did register for vaccination last month.	Ke a netefatsa gore ke kwadiseditse go entiwa mo kgweding e e fetileng.
But up to date, nobody has contacted me to advise me as to when must I go for vaccination.	Fela go fitlha jaanong, ga gona ope yo o nkitsiseng gore ke tshwanetse go ya kae go ka fitlhela moento wa me.
Remember that people my age have been declared endangered species but the government is failing us.	Gakologelwa gore batho ba dingwaga tsa me ba re, re batho ba ba leng mo kotsing, mme puso ga e re sireletse.
I dont know whether we should organise a Toyi-Toyi so that they can hear us as people over 60 years because this is a government that normally listens when people burn tyres and Toyi-Toyi.	Ga ke itse gore a re tshwanetse go rulaganya Toyi-Toyi gore ba tle ba kgone go re utlwa jaaka batho ba ba fetang dingwaga di le 60 ka gonne puso e ka tlwaelo, e reetsa fela batho ba tukisa dithaere le go toyi-toya.
Maybe we should consider that.	Gongwe re tshwanetse go tsaya tsia seo.
Lekota says he has also not yet received any notification and Prince Buthelezis office says he has not yet been vaccinated.	Lekota a re le ena ga ise a amogele kitsiso e fe, le ba ofisi ya Prince Buthelezis ba re ga a ise a amogele meonto.

The government says it will not be putting any more money into the new airline.	Puso ya re ga e kitla e ntsha madi a mantsi mo setheong se sešwa sa difofane.
Takatso will invest just over R3-billion in the new SAA.	Takatso e tlile go beeletsa madi a kana ka dibilione di le tharo tsa diranta  (R3-billion) go SAA e ntšhwa.
Gordhan says government will have a 33% representation in the airlines management while the operational capability will come from SAA staff and the Takatso Consortium.

The Democratic Alliance (DA) has raised concerns about the partnership between Takatso Consortium and the South African Airways.	Ba Democratic Alliance (DA) ba tsositse matshwenyego ka ga tirisanommogo fa gare ga Takatso Consortium le bulela South African Airways.
DAs Alf Lees says it remains to be seen how this will work out.	 Alf Lees wa DA a re seno se tlaa tshwanelwa ke go emelwa gore se bonwe gore a se tlaa tswelapele.
Interesting thing is that it appears that the 51% shareholding is being gifted to this particular consortium at no cost to the consortium.	Selo se se makatsang ke gore go lebega e kare diphesente di le 51 tsa beng badišere bo filwe bona ba consortium ka go se nne le ditshenyegelo tse di duetsweng mo setheong.
In other words, they are giving it free and we would ask the question as to how come this particular consortium is given a gift of 51% of the shares at SAA when it hasn’t been a public call for a request for proposals.	Ka fa letlhakoreng le le nngwe, ba e neela tsona mahala mme re ka botsa potso ya gore go tlaa jang gore consortuim eno e nelwe mpho ya diphesente di le 51 tsa dišere tsa SAA go ise go dirwe kopo ya ditshitshinyo tsa setšhaba.

In order for the taxpayer to no longer foot the bill for this failed airline, the bailout should stop.	Gore baduelalekgetho ba sa tlhole ba duela sekoloto sa setheo sa difofane, go duela go, go tshwanetse go khutla.
We do, however, question this specific partnership, the amount of money and we also have to question if they would be a further need for guarantees to get the airline flying again.	 Le fa go ntse jalo, re belaela semphato se, palo ya madi mme tshwanetse go botsa gape Potso ya gore a go tlile go nna le tlhokego ya go netefatsa gore a na setheo sa difofane se tlilego fofa gape.

Following a challenge by the Public Protector which was heard from Monday to Wednesday, the Western Cape High Court has started hearing a challenge by the group, Democracy In Action (DIA).

The DIA has introduced a new challenge that was not raised by the Public Protector.	DIA e tlhagisitse kgwetlho e ntšhwa e e sa tlhagisiwang ke Mosireletsi wa Setšhaba.
They say the new rules are unconstitutional because they did not involve public participation.	Ba re melawana e mentšhwa ga e mo molaotheong ka gonne ga ba akaretsa botsayakarolo jwa setšhaba.
The DIA has been openly supporting the Public Protector in her legal troubles.	DIA e ntse e tshegetsa Mosireletsi wa Setšhaba ka mathata a semolao.
The organisation has already raised thousands of rands to help her cover some of the personal costs imposed by courts.	Mokgatlho o setse o tlhagisitse diketekete tsa diranta go mo thusa go duelela dingwe tsa ditshenyegelo tsa gagwe tse di lebisitsweng ke dikgotlatshekelo.

In the past few weeks while this whole thing was unfolding, we’ve been trying to see where we can get additional funds to cover the short fall, because, ladies and gentlemen, the problem R300 million is the shortfall.

As the minister ultimately responsible, I want to issue an unconditional apology to the sector as whole for being let down by our entities in this instance by the National Arts Council and in the process, exposing the most vulnerable sector in our society during this period of COVID-19, the Minister says.	Jaaka Tona e kwa bofelong e tsayang maikarabelo, ke batla go kopa maitshwarelo go lekala lotlhe ka go swabisiwa ke khansele ya bosetšhaba ya botsweretshi, mme mo go yona ntlha eo, re tlhagise gape le lekala le le sa sireletsegang mo setšhabeng sa rona mo nakong e ya covid-19.

This includes those who’ve received multiple funds for their companies.	Seno se akaretsa ba ba amogetseng madi kwa ditlamong tsa bona.
Kwaito legend, Arthur Mafokate, was accused of claiming funds using multiple companies, but refutes the allegations.	Naledi ya mmino wa Kwaito, Arthur Mafokate o ne a latofadiwa ka go ntsha matlole a dirisa ditlamo tse dintsi tse di farologaneng, mme o ganetsane le ditatofatso.
Mthethwa hopes the review will assist in addressing the shortfall.	Mthethwa o solofela gore thadiso e tlaa thusa mo go samaganeng le madi a a tlhaelang.
There is a process of investigating duplications, or of people who may be in a process or possibility of getting more within their area.	Go na le thulaganyo ya go batlisisa dipoeletso, kgotsa ya batho ba ba ka nnang mo thulaganyong kgotsa kgonagalo ya go bona madi a mantsi mo mafelong a bona.
Because of the adjustments which are being done with regards to the shortfall, a lot of things are being reviewed even people who have been promised to get money from multi sources, he explains.

About 50km outside South Africa’s biggest city, Johannesburg, lies one of the most important sites in human prehistory: the Cradle of Humankind.	Dikilometarata di le 50 kwa ntle ga toropo e kgolo mo Aforikaborwa, Johannesburg, go ntse lengwe la mafelo a a botlhokwa thata mo hisetoring ya botho: Cradle of Humankind.
Here, at sites like the Sterkfontein Caves, Swartkrans, Drimolen and Kromdraai, researchers have unearthed amazing fossil evidence from the Plio-Pleistocene (the last five million years).	Fano, mo mafelong a a tshwanang le Sterkfontein Caves, Swartkrans, Drimolen le Kromdraai , babatlisisi ba  bone bopaki jo bo makatsang thata jwa fosele , go tswa go Plio Pleistocene (dingwaga di le dimilione di le tlhano tse di fetileng).
It is especially famous for the discovery of fossilised hominin ancient human remains.	E tumileng thata ka thibololo ya marapo a batho ba bogolololo ba Homonini ba ba tlhokafetseng.
But there is a more recent and largely neglected layer to the landscape’s history.	Mme go na le boalo jwa sešweng jo bo itlhokomolositsweng jwa history ya naga.
My colleagues and I set out to investigate some archaeological traces found in part of the Cradle of Humankind.	Nna le badirimmogo ka nna ke ikaelela go batlisisa dingwe tsa dithuto ya boithutamarope tse di fitlhelwang mo karolong ya Cradle of Humankind.
We focused on a stone-walled structure on a hill known as Driefontein; the name also given to the site we studied.	Re tlhomile mogopolo mo leboteng le le agilweng ka matlapa mo thoteng e e itsegeng jaaka Driefontein; Leina le le neetsweng lefelo le re ithutileng ka lona.
Our findings suggest that the Driefontein stone-walled structure was a residential area.	Diphitlhelelo tsa rona di supa gore lebota le le agilweng ka matlapa la Driefontein, e ne e le lefelo la baagi.
It appears similar to settlements found elsewhere in South Africa’s North West province and parts of Botswana dating to between AD 1450 and 1700, though certain features possibly suggest a later date.	Le lebega go tshwana le mafelo a a fitlhelwang mo Porofenseng ya Bokone Bophirima mo Aforikaborwa le dikarolo tsa Botswana,  magareng ga AD 1450 le 1700, le fa e le gore diponagalo tse dingwe di tlhagisa letlha le le kwa morago.
These findings place the settlements occupation broadly within the Tswana period.	Diphitlhelelo tse di baya tseo ya tulo mo nakong ya Batswana.
This refers to roughly the last 500 years of history when Tswana communities, a southern African ethnic group, arose.	Se se bontsha dingwaga tse di ka nnang tse 500 tsa hisetori, fa ditšhaba tsa Batswana, setlhopha sa morafe wa Borwa jwa Aforika, se ne se simolola go nna teng
While the prehistoric sequence of the Cradle of Humankind operates at several levels spanning a very long period of time, a disproportionate amount of resources have been allocated to studies concerning human evolution and early stone tool technologies.	Fa tatelano ya tshimologo ya hisetori ya Cradle of Humankind e direla mo dikgatong di le mmalwa tsa sebaka sa paka ya nako e telele, palo e e sa lekalekaneng ya didirisiwa e abetswe dithuto tse di mabapi le phetogo ya batho le didiriswa tsa dithekenoloji ya matlapa.
While this has global significance, our work is important, too, because it sheds light on heritage traces that reveal much about people’s daily lives.	Le fa se se le botlhokwa lefatshe ka bophara, tiro ya rona e botlhokwa go feta, ka gonne e ruta batho ka ga boswa jo bo  senolang go le gontsi ka ga matshelo a batho a letsatsi le letsatsi.
It also helps us understand local, traumatic pasts which involved colonial oppression, land dispossession and racial policies.	Gape e re thusa go tlhaloganya maikutlo a a botlhoko a selegae, a a akaretsang kgatelelo ya bokolone, go tseelwa lefatshe le dipholisi tsa semorafe.
Cultural remains such as those found at Driefontein allow archaeology to peel back historical discourse to reveal people’s pasts that are not preserved in any other way.	Marapo a a tshwanang le a a fitlhetsweng kwa Driefontein a letla akhioloji go boela morago kwa hisetoring le go senola dilo tsa batho tse di fetileng, tse di sa sirelediwang ka tsela epe.
Our work at the settlement involved an intensive mapping programme conducted over four successive visits.	Tiro ya rona kwa tulong e, e akaretsa go nna le seabe mo lenaneong la go rulaganya ka kelotlhoko e e tseneletseng le le dirilweng mo diketelong di le nne tsa go latelana.
Initially we determined the overall size of the settlement, in order to plan our field programme, and then we examined the layout of the homesteads dry-packed stone-walled architecture.	Kwa tshimologong, re lebeletse gore lefelo le bogolo jo bo kana kang gore re kgone go rulaganya lenaneo la rona, mme morago ra sekaseka thulaganyo ya boagi jwa lebota la letlapa.
To record the site, maps were produced using a combination of handheld GPSs and a Trimble Station; these use satellites to record geo-specific points that can be rendered digitally to resemble the settlement’s structure and features.	Go rekota lefelo, dimmepe di ne tsa tlhagisiwa ka go dirisa kopantsho ya GPS e e tshwarwang ka letsogo le seteišene sa trimble; dilo tse di dirisa sathalaete go rekota mafelo a a rileng a a ka dirisang tsa dijithale go senola  diponagalo tsa kagego ya bonno.
An enclosure inside the western settlement likely used as a kraal for livestock.	Lefelo le le mo teng ga bonno jwa sešweng jo bo ka tswa bo dirisiwa jaaka lesaka la diruiwa.
Mapping the site is informative; as building designs today differ between people and over time, so did past stone-walled structures.	Go dira mmapa wa lefelo go neelana ka tshedimosetso ka ntlha ya gore ditsela tsa go dira dilo gompieno di farologana go ya ka batho le go ya ka nako, fela jalo le ka dikago tsa matlapa tsa mo nakong e e fetileng.
By studying the layout of the settlement, we can then attempt to determine who occupied the site and when.	Ka go ithuta ka boalo jwa tulo e, re ka leka go tlhomamisa gore ke mang yo o neng a nna mo lefelong le, le nako e ba nnileng mo go lona ka yona.
Archaeologists have been doing this from the 1960s and there is a fairly good record of what the different types of sites look like.	Baithutamarope ba ntse ba dira seno go tloga ka dingwaga tsa bo 1960 mme go na le rekoto e e siameng ya mefuta e e farologaneng ya mafelo a a lebegang jalo.
By examining the structure of Driefontein, we could then match its architecture to typologies developed over the past 60 years and determine when it was occupied.	Ka go sekaseka popego ya Driefontein, re ka golaganya dikago tsa yona le mefuta e e  tlhamilweng mo dingwageng di le 60 tse di fetileng le go tlhomamisa gore batho ba nnile mo go tsona leng.
We can also infer the use of different areas of the site.	Gape re ka tsenyeletsa le tiriso ya dikarolo tse di farologaneng tsa lefelo.
There are other ways of doing this, such as through ceramic analysis or archaeological excavations, but at Driefontein very few items remain on the surface and there is no excavatable deposit.	Go na le ditsela tse dingwe tsa go dira se, jaaka ka tshekatsheko ya boalo kgotsa diphatololo tsa dilo tsa bogologolo, mme kwa Driefontein ke dilo di le mmalwa fela tse di salang mo godimo ga mmu mme ga go na sepe se se ka epololwang.
However, two middens were identified.	Le gale, mekoa e mebedi ya boloko e supilwe.
These were used as dump sites and often contain valuable archaeological material such as ceramic sherds, food waste, and personal ornaments.	Tseno di ne di dirisiwa jaaka mafelo a go latlhela matlakala mme go le gantsi a tshwere thuto e e botlhokwa jaaka boalo, leswe la dijo le mekgabisa ya batho.
Unfortunately, at Driefontein this was not the case; this meant that studying the walls layout was the only viable way of learning more about the history of the site.	Ka bomadimabe, kwa Driefontein se se ne se se jalo; Se se raya gore go ithuta ka boalo jwa dipota e ne e le yone fela tsela ya go ithuta go le gontsi ka ga hisetori ya lefelo.
Driefontein includes two distinct areas; what we call west and east.	Driefontein e akaretsa mafelo a mabedi a a farologaneng; Se re se bitsang Bophirima le Botlhaba.
Both have large circular structures outside the main walled area.	Bobedi jwa tsona bo na le sepopego se se sediko kwa ntle ga lefelo le le dikagenyeditsweng ke dipota.
These may have been kraals (enclosures) for livestock.	Tseno e ka tswa e ne e le masaka a (ditswalo) a diruiwa.
The main portions of the two areas both have an internal walled area with separate smaller enclosures attached.	Dikarolo tse dikgolo tsa mafelo a mabedi a di na le mafelo a a ka fa gare a a dikagenyeditsweng ke dipota le ditswalo tse di nnye tse di aroganeng.
Around this is a discontinuous and scalloping boundary wall.	Mo tikologong eno go na le diphatlha le lebota le le dirang molelwane wa scalloping.
Between it and the inner enclosure are up to 20 individual huts, including several with outside terraces.	Fa gare ga lefelo le, go na le matlo a bojang a ka nna 20, go akaretsa a le mmalwa a a nang le legora la kwa ntle.
These are indicated by upright rocks erected in a circular shape with extensions where terraces exist.	Tse, di supiwa ka matlapa a a emeletseng, a a agilweng ka sebopego se se sediko, le dikatoloso mo go nang le legora teng.
There are also grain bin foundations in the vicinity of several huts, which are similar in construction to the huts but are far smaller.	Go na gape le metheo ya dithoro mo tikologong ya matlo a bojang a le mmalwa, tse di agilweng go tshwana le matlo a bojang, fela tsona ke tse dinnye thata.
Upright rocks indicate the presence of a hut, since disappeared, with this one possessing a front terrace.	Matlapa a a emeletseng a supa go nna teng ga ntlo ya bojang, fa e sale a nyelela, fa e yona na le legora la kwa pele.
Based on the evidence, as well as the middens and a small collection of earthenware ceramics, the Driefontein stone-walled structure was a residential area.	Go ikaegilwe ka bopaki, gammogo le mekoa ya boloko le kokoanyo e nnye ya matsoapa, kago ya lebota la matlapa ya kwa Driefontein e ne e le lefelo la baagi.
The structure appears similar to settlements dating to between AD 1450 and 1700.	Kago e, e tshwana  le mafelo a a neng a le teng magareng ga  AD 1450 le 1700.
However, certain features  notably the upright rocks around the huts and lintels in the outside circular structures  have been identified at sites with a later date.	Le fa go le jalo, diponagalo tse dingwe, segololobogolo matlapa a a a emeletseng go dikologa matlo a bojang le mephako e e mo dikagong tse di kwa ntle tse di sediko di supilwe kwa mafelong ao, ka letlha le le kwa morago.
This possibly suggests that Driefontein is younger than we may expect.	Seno se ka tswa se kaya gore Driefontein e nnye go feta ka mokgwa o re neng re solofetse ka ona.
Though the settlements occupation falls within the Tswana period, naming the occupants as Tswana is complicated.	Le fa tseo ya mafelo a e wela mo nakong ya Batswana, go bitsa batho ba nnang mo tulong e re re ke Batswana, go marara.
That’s because Tswana history is not linear or direct.	Se ke ka ntlha ya gore hisetori ya Batswana ga e a tlhamalala.
Rather, there are periods of migration, political growth, and assimilation.	Go na le moo, go na le dinako tsa phudugo, kgolo ya sepolotiki le go itlwaetsa.
Tswana origins are also unclear	Tlholego ya Batswana le yona ga e a tlhapa sentle.
At times, oral histories note multiple lineages and totems with several different groups appearing and blending with others.	Ka dinako tse dingwe, dihisetori tsa molomo di ela tlhoko masika a le mantsi le merafe e e nang le ditlhopha tse di farologaneng di le mmalwa tse di tlhagelelang le go itlhakanya le ba bangwe.
When looking back at early archaeological sequences, such as may be the case at Driefontein, identifying Tswana groups is, for these reasons, quite challenging.	Fa re lebelela kwa morago ka tatelano ya thuto ya marope, jaaka go ka nna jalo kwa Driefontein, go supa ditlhopha tsa Batswana, ka ntlha ya mabaka a, go ne go le thata.
Nonetheless, based on the evidence, we believe Driefontein was likely occupied by Tswana-like groups after about AD 1450.	Le fa go ntse jalo, go ikaegilwe ka bopaki, re dumela gore Driefontein e ka tswa e ne e na le ditlhopha tsa batho, tse di tshwanang le Batswana, ba ba neng ba dula koo morago ga AD 1450.
