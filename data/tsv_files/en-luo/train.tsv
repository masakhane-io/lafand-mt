South Africa’s Standard Bank, an affiliate of ICBC, was also going to fund the project but announced in 2017 it was pulling out, saying it had started reducing its carbon footprint annually as much as possible. 	Standard Bank ma South Africa, ma otudore gi ICBC, bende ne owinjore ochiw pesa migerogo kambi ma lamu, kata kamano, ne gilando ni giwalore e wachno e higa mar 2017 ka giwacho ni gidwaro dwoko piny higa ka higa, pesa ma gichiwo mitiyogo e weche maka mar kidi.
“We reduce our own carbon footprint as much as possible each year. We have funded far more renewable energy generation than coal-fired power. We will apply very stringent conditions to any future funding of non-renewable energy,” said the bank.	"“Higa ka higa, watimo kar nyalowa mondo wadwok piny pesa ma wachiwo kendo matiyo e weche mag maka mar stima.Wasiro kembe mang'eny moloyo maloso stima gi yore ma ok chid muya kopim gi kembe ma wasiro matiyo gi maka mar kidi.

The African Development Bank (AfDB) had at some point also considered financing the plant, while America’s General Electric (GE) was to provide what it termed “clean coal technology,” which would bring down pollution.

Newly elected United States President Joe Biden following his inauguration early this year underscored the seriousness of the threat posed by the continued exploitation of unclean energy sources such as coal by signing a treaty that saw America rejoin the Paris Agreement.

Over the past year or so, digital transformation accelerated at an unprecedented rate in societies around the world. 	Gimoro higa achiel kama mokalo, gik mitimo e intanet osemedore matamre ginono e piny mangima.

“You simply store the value of money in the shares. So, when you buy 100 shares of Safaricom using Sh1,000, that means the value of your money is in the shares that you have bought,” said Bichiang’a.

Nairobi motorists will pay Sh126.37 per litre for petrol after the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) increased prices by Sh3.56 per litre.

In a statement, EPRA said the average landed cost of imported petrol decreased by 0.57 per cent from US$491.50 per cubic metre in March 2021 to US$488.69 per cubic metre in April 2021.

When it retained April-May prices at the same level as March-April, Epra and  the Petroleum Ministry had brokered a deal with oil marketing companies to slash their margins. 	Ka ne giweyo nengo ma April-Mei ochalre gi ma Mach-April, EPRA kod migawo mar mafuta e pachoka mong'ere kaka Petroleum Ministry nowinjore gi kembe ma uso mafuta mondo odwok nengo maggi piny.
Thehe oil firms were later compensated by the National Treasury.	Bang'e migawo mar weche pesa ma pachoka mong'ere kaka National Treasury nochulo kembe mag mafutago.
The companies took a Sh4.44 cut per litre of petrol. 	Kembego nong'ado siling' 4.44 kuom lita achiel mar petrol.

In all, it is estimated that the total amount taken form the marketers was Sh1.34 billion.	Ka ogo kwanno duto, to pesa duto ma ne okaw kuom jousogo dirom bilion 1.34.
While Treasury refunded the lost margins in the course of last month, there was an extra cost of Sh0.50 per litre of fuel, said to be the administrative cost of processing and disbursing the compensation to the oil marketing companies.	Kata obedo ni migawo mar weche pesa ne ochulo pesa ma jousogo ne olalo dwe mokalo, ne nitiere pesa momedore ma romo siling' 0.50 kuom lita ka lita mar mafuta, ma wachore ni ofis ne otiyogo e iko kendo kowo pesa ma ne ochul kembe ma uso mafutago.
The marketers and the petroleum Ministry had at an April 15 meeting agreed that the Sh0.50 per litre was a prudent cost incurred in the delivery of petroleum products to Kenyans and would be recovered during the May-June pricing cycle	Jousogo kod migawo mar mafuta nowinjore e romo moro ma ne gitimo April 15 ni siling' 0.50 kuom lita ka lita-no ne en pesa ma notigo kare e keyo ne jo Kenya mwandu molos gi mafuta kendo ni ne idhi dwoke kiseto nengo gik moko e alap ma Mei-Jun
“The administration fee incurred by cargo buyers during this process is considered a prudent cost and shall be included in the import cost build of the OTS cargoes to be considered in the May-June 2021 pricing cycle,” reads the minute of the meeting signed by Andrew Kamau PS Petroleum and Daniel Kiptoo acting chief executive Epra.	Weche ma nowach e burano ma noketie sei gi Andrew Kamau ma en PS mar Petroleum kod Daniel Kiptoo ma en Acting Chief Executive Officer (CEO) ma EPRA wacho kama, “Pesa ma ofis notiyogo sama ne gidwoko ne jong'iew msike pesagi ikwano ni ne otiyo kare kendo ibiro riwe e kwan sama ibiro go kwand nengo mar kelo msike  pinywaka kokalo kuom OTS e alap ma Mei-Jun 2021 .”
MPesa has now become the leading revenue stream for Safaricom, beating voice that has traditionally been the company’s mainstay. 	Goyo sime osebedo yo maduong' mar nweng'o ne jo Safaricom, to sani koro Mpesa oloye ka e yo maduong' ma Safaricom nwang'ogo yuto.
The mobile money service earned Safaricom Sh82.65 billion while voice service generated Sh82.55 billion in the year that ended March 31.	Mpesa nokelo ne jo Safaricom bilion 82.65 to goyo sime to noloso bilion 82.55 e higa ma norumo Mach tarik 31.
This performance came even as the telco reported a 6.8 per cent drop in profit after tax to Sh68.6 billion compared to Sh73.6 billion reported the previous year.

Wang'ni giyudo ohala ma romo bilion 68.6 to higa mokalo ne giyudo bilion 73.6.
The profit was held down by Central Bank’s directive to mobile operators to offer mobile money transactions under Sh1,000 free of charge last year as well as the poor state of the economy due to Covid-19.

However, Peter Ndegwa, the Safaricom chief executive said the company’s earnings were better than anticipated as the company and the economy appeared to head into recovery in the second half of the financial year.	Kata kamano, Peter Ndegwa, ma en CEO mar Safaricom nowacho ni kambino nyocha oyudo ohala maber moloyo kaka ne giparo nikech kambino kod yuto ma thurka nosechako duogo e wang'e e kor higa mar timo ohala.

The company had projected to make pre-tax profit of between Sh91 billion and Sh94 billion for the year, a 10 per cent drop from the previous year.	Kambino ne geno loso ohala e kind bilion 91 billion kod 94 e higa mangima kapok ogol osuru, ma en dok chien mar pasent 10 kopim gi yuto ma higa mokalo.
However, it reported even better results at Sh96.16 billion in earnings before interest and tax. 	Kata kamano, pesa ma ne giyudo ne romo bilion 96.16 kapok ogol osuru kod interest.
“The recovery in the second half of the year was driven by the return to charging on M-Pesa transactions in the fourth quarter, double-digit growth in mobile data, fixed data growth alongside growth in consumers and usage,” said Ndegwa. 	Ndegwa nowacho kama, “Ne wadok e wang'e e kor higa nikech ne wachako ng'ado ji kuom oro pesa e M-Pesa e dweche adek mogik mar higa, ne wadongo e mobile data gi pasent modhuro, ne wadongo e fixed data, kastembewa ne omedore, kendo ne nitie medruok bende e yo ma ji ne otiyogo gi laini marwa.”

Overall, M-Pesa revenue fell by Sh1.8 billion in the last financial year from Sh84.44 billion made in the previous year, the largest drop in recent years.

The most affected revenue streams were in mobile money transfers and payments, which reported Sh4.2 billion and Sh1.7 billion drop in earnings for the year. 	Kidieny ma ne ohinyore ahinya ne en korka oro pesa kod chudo kitiyo gi M-Pesa ma ne ohandegi ne odok chien gi bilion 4.2 kod bilion 1.7 e higa mangima.

At the same time, revenue from voice fell by Sh4 billion from Sh86.53 billion while SMS revenue grew 11.7 per cent to Sh13.6 billion as at the end of the financial year. 	Gie sechego, pesa ma ne oyud kowuok e goyo simu ne olwar gi bilion kowuok e bilion 86.53 to pes SMS noidho gi pasent 11.7 nyaka bilion 13.6 e giko higa mar weche ohala.

Safaricom further realised Sh4.2 billion in earnings from sports betting in the period under review, marking a 12 per cent increase compared to last year.	Bende, Safaricom ne oyudo bilion 4.2 kowuok e betting mar sports kuom kinde ma pod ginono, mano en medruok mar pasent 12 kopim gi higa mokalo.
This was largely attributed to a decision by the High Court earlier this year that lifted a ban on outdoor advertising on betting and the resumption of sporting activities towards the end of the financial year.   	Dongruok ma kamano luwore gi bura ma Kot Mamalo nong'ado e chak higani ma nogolo marfuk mar lando betting e lela kod dwoko tuke e giko higa mar weche ohala.

Mobile data revenue stood at Sh44.7 billion, an increase of Sh4.6 billion compared to the figure reported during a similar period last year.	Pesa ma ne oyud e mobile data ne romo bilion 44.7, ma en medruok mar bilion 4.6 kopim gi ripot ma ne ogol e kinde ma kama higa mokalo.
The number of active customers on the company’s fibre to the home business rose to 137,400 as at the end of last year, up from 104,500 in the previous year. 	Kwan mar kastembe ma tiyo gi home fibre mar kambino ne omedore nyaka 137,400 chop giko higa mokalo, kowuok e 104,500 ma en kwan mar higa morocho.
“Fixed service and wholesale transit revenue grew six per cent year-on-year to Sh9.5 billion supported by growth in fibre to the home revenue, which grew 49 per cent to Sh3.5 billion,” said Dilip Pal, the chief finance officer.	Dilip Pal, ma en Chief Finance Officer nowacho ni, “Pesa ma noyud e Fixed service kod wholesale transit nomedore gi pasent auchiel e higa mochopo bilion 9.5 kisire gi medruok e pes home fibre, ma ne odongo gi pasent 49 mochopo bilion 3.5.”

Pal further said a reduction in capital expenditure by 3.2 per cent to Sh34.9 billion as well as a similar drop in operating expenditure to Sh46 billion managed to stem some of the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the bottom line. 	Pal nomedo wacho ni dwoko piny pesa mitiyogo e medo gik manyien gi pasent 3.2 nyaka bilion 34.9, kendo dwoko piny pesa mitiyogo e dije mapile nyaka bilion 46, nokonyo e kedo gi pek ma Covid-19 nokelo.
The company has proposed to pay Sh36.8 billion in dividends for the year, which is 34 per cent less than the Sh56 billion it paid out the previous year.

Chinese firms fight over Sh20 billion dam on River Nyando	Kembe mag Jo-China kedo ne siling' milion 20 midwaro gergo yao moro Aora Nyando.
The planned construction of a Sh20 billion water dam along Kisumu’s River Nyando has hit a false start after two Chinese companies that bid for the job opened a vicious legal battle over the award of the tender.	Chenro ma ne osetim mar gero yaono Kisumu e Aora Nyando ma ne dhi kawo siling' milion 20 nolal nono ka ne Kembe ariyo mag Jo-China ma ne chano timo tijno noyawo lweny e kindgi ni ng'ano ma ibiro mi mich nikech tijno.
China Gezhouba, one of the firms that bid for the job, has moved to the procurement review board to contest award of the tender to China Jiangxi Economic Cooperation citing irregularities in the tendering process.	China Gezhouba, ma en achiel kuom kembe mag Jo-China ma ne dwaro tijno, osekawo okang' mar dhi e bod mondo gi ked ne kambi machielo mar Jo-China miluongo ni Jiangxi Economic Cooperation nikech joma nokawo tijno ok omakore gi time.
China Gezhouba, which placed a Sh19.2 billion bid for the job reckons that the National Water Harvesting and Storage Authority’s (NWHSA) decision to award the contract to China Jiangxi was irregular and unfair as the rival firm had placed a higher bid of Sh19.9 billion.	China Gezhouba ma nochulo siling' bilion 19.2 ne tijno wacho ni paro ma migawo mar National Water Harvesting and Storage Authority’s (NWHSA) nong'ado mar miyo kambi mar China Jiangxi tijno ne ok kare kata matin nikech kambi machielo ma gilarogo tijno ne ochiwo siling' bilion 19.9.
Public procurement regulations require that prequalification to evaluate a bidder’s ability to perform the contract obligations is done before the process moves to the technical and financial evaluation stage which awards the contract to ‘the lowest evaluated bidder.’	Chike ma miyo ng'ato ratiro mar yudo tich moro dwaro ni ka pok omi ng'ato tenda mar timo tich moro, onego onon ka be en gi nyalo mar timo tijno kapok weche odhi mabor kendo tijno imiyo ‘jal mogoyo nengo matin mogik.’
In its appeal to the Public Procurement Administration Review Board (PPARB), China Gezhouba argues that the water harvesting authority did not pick the lowest bidder for the Nyando dam works, causing it to lose the job.	Okang' ma kambi mar China Gezhouba nokawo motero ywakgi ne migawo mar Public Procurement Administration Review Board (PPARB), ne giwacho ni migawo mar Water Harvesting Authority ne ok oyiero kambi ma ne ogoyo nengo matin mogik ne tij gero yao e Aora Nyando, kendo mano nomiyo gilalo tijno.
But the National Water Harvesting and Storage Authority has responded to the appeal arguing that China Gezhouba had failed to meet all the contract requirements and therefore did not make it to the final round of the tendering.	Kata kamanao, migawo mar National Water Harvesting and Storage Authority nochiwo dwoko ka giwacho ni kambi mar Gezhouba ne ok ochopo gik ma ne dwarore duto, to mano nomiyo tenda mar tijno obayogi.
“The Act provides that the successful tender is one with the lowest evaluated price,... In this case the applicant was not the lowest evaluated tender and was therefore not denied his rightful advance to the technical and financial evaluation stages.”	“Chik wacho ni kambi ma ogoyo nengo ma tinnie mogik e ma imiyo tenda,... Omiyo nengo ma kambi mar China Gezhouba ne ogoyo ok e ma ne tinnie omiyo wan ok ne watamogi dhi nyime kawo okenge momedore ma ne dwarore mondo giyud tijno.”
The water harvesting authority says China Gezhouba had, among other things, submitted documents in Chinese whose translation to English language had not been certified.	Migawo mar Water Harvesting Authority wacho ni kambi mar Gezhouba ne ochiwo barupe mag dho China ma loko margi e dho Kisungu ne pok opwodhi.
The firm also failed to commit to buy at least 40 per cent of the supplies used in construction of the dam from local firms, the water harvesting authority says adding that the petitioner also failed to demonstrate capacity through proof of ownership of earthmovers and other equipment for the job.	Bende, kambino ne ok onyiewo pasent 40 mag gige gedo e kembe ma ni e alwora ka kaka ne wawinjore, e wi mano, jal ma ne dwaro tijno ne ok onyiso ayanga ni en gi geche mag tich kod gik ma moko ma ne dwarore ne tijno.
China Gezhouba is also said to have failed to provide evidence of permanent residency in Kenya. 	Wachore bende ni kambi mar China Gezhouba ne ok onyiso ni gin gi kar dak mosiko e piny Kenya.
The water harvesting authority says it is for these reasons that China Gezhoub’s bid was declared non-responsive and did not proceed to the technical and financial evaluation stage.	Migawo mar Water Harvesting Authority wacho ni wechego e ma nomiyo gineno ni kambi mar China Gezhouba ok owinjore yudo tijno omiyo ne ok ginyal dhi nyime luwo okenge ma ne dwarore e  yudo tijno.
But China Gezhouba has refuted the claims insisting it had complied with all the requirements set out by the water authority in the tender documents.	Kata kamano, kambi mar China Gezhouba odagi wechego ka giwacho ni ne gichopo gik moko duto ma ne migawo mar Water Harvesting Authority ne dwaro e wach tijno.
In its filings at the PPARB, the company wants the board to direct the water authority to evaluate the bids afresh, this time round taking into consideration the documents it had submitted.	E barup gi mar ywak ma ne gitero e migawo mar PPARB, kambi mar China Gezhouba ne dwaro ni migawo mar Water Harvesting Authority odog e chike ma tayo tijno ma ne giketo kendo ginon adimba otese ma ne gioro ka gikwayogo tijno.
“The reason provided by the procuring entity… are incorrect and misleading and were arrived at by misapprehending the tender documents submitted by the applicant,” China Gezhouba says in its filing at the PPARB.	Kambi mar China Gezhouba wacho e barua ma ne gitero ne migawo mar PPARB ni, “Weche ma migawo mar Water Harvesting Authority nowacho ok nikare kata matin, gilalo ji kendo ni joma oro kwayo mar tijno ok nyal winjo tiendgi maler.”
China Gezhouba claims that award of the tender to China Jiangxi was contrary to provisions of the Procurement Act and the Constitution that require procuring entities to ensure cost-effectiveness.	Kambi mar China Gezhouba wacho ni bedo ni nomi kambi mar China Jiangxi tenda mar tijno ne ok oluwore gi chike mag Procurement Act kod Chike ma moko ma ne dhi neno ni oti gi pesa moromo e tijno.
“The award of the tender to the second respondent (China Jiangxi) did not meet the constitutional threshold of fairness, equity, transparency and competitiveness… neither was it in compliance with the principles set out in Section three of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act,” the company says.	Kambino wacho niiya, “Tenda ma ne omi kambi mar Jiangxi ne ok ochopo chike ma dwarore e chiwo tich ma onge dewo wang', ma dwaro ni adiera obedie kendo miyo ji te thuolo mar nyiso nyalo margi. Bende ne ok oluw weche ma yudore e kare mar adek mar chike mag Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act.”
China Gezhouba is not new to Kenya’s construction market and has won multi-billion shilling tenders for construction of major works, including Thwake Dam in Makueni County as well as the Northern Collector Tunnel in Murang'a County.	Kambi mar China Gezhouba ok en kambi manyien e piny Kenya kendo oseyudo tenda mang'eny ma miyo oyudo pesa bilionde e tije mag gero gik madongo dongo moriwo gero Thwake Dam e Kaunti ma Makueni kaachiel gi Northern Collector Tunnel e Kaunti ma Murang'a.
Sharon Obonyo, the water authority's Chief Executive, in a replying affidavit filed with PPARB insists that China Gezhouba had failed to follow the guidelines that the authority had provided when it invited bids for construction of the dam.	Sharon Obonyo, ma en Ker (Chief Executive) e migawo mar Water Harvesting Authority, nochiwo dwoko e wi barura mar affidavit ma ne migawo mar PPARB ondiko kojiwo ni kambi mar China Gezhouba ne ok oluwo weche duto ma ne dwarore mondo ng'ato oyud tenda mar gero yao ma Nyando.
Ms Obonyo says there are disparities between the documents that China Gezhouba submitted in its appeal to the PPARB and what it had submitted to the authority during the tendering. 	Ms Obonyo wacho ni nitie pogruok e kind foms mag appeal ma ne kambi mar China Gezhouba ooro ne migawo mar PPARB kod foms ma ne gimanyogo tenda mar tij gedono.
“The documents presented to PPARB are in some instances misleading and total forgeries as the same are different from the documents submitted in the bid document,” the authority says.	Migawo mar Water Harvesting Authority wacho ni, “Foms ma ne gichiwo ne migawo mar PPARB ok wach adier, gin mana gik mochuogi kendo gipogore gi ma ne ochiw kimanyogo tenda mar tij gedo.”
Ms Obonyo also says China Gezhouba had sent its commitment to source 40 per cent of supplies locally after the bids had been opened. 	Ms Obonyo bendo nomedo ni, kambi mar China Gezhouba nosingore ni gibiro nyiewo gige gedo ma kwan gi romo pasent 40 e kembe ma ni e alwora ka ka po ni omigi tenda mar gero yaono.
She insists China Gezhouba had sent an email with the letter on April 9 at 5.40pm while the bids had been opened earlier in the day at 9.00am. 	Ms Obonyo oramo ni kambi mar China Gezhouba nooro email kaachiel gi barua tarik 9 April sa 11.40 odhiambo to mano noyudo ka oseyaw thuolo mar oro kwayo ne tijno sa 3 okinyi chieng'no.
She accused the firm of tampering with the emails filed with the procurement review board as evidence to show that it had sent the email earlier. 	Nowacho ni kambino nochocho email ma ne migawo mochung' ne tij gedono nooro mondo onere ni ne gioro email no motelo .
“I have noted with extreme concern that the applicant’s email screengrab… has been tampered with and is a pure forgery,” Ms Obonyo says in her affidavit.	Ms Obonyo nowacho kama e barupgi mar affidavit, “Nafwenyo ni email ma ne kambino ooro ne okop kamoro kendo ne otem lok weche ma ni e iye, omiyo oting'o miriambo lilo.”
"“Specifically, a keen examination of the applicant’s exhibit… shows that the same has been tampered with to mislead the board to perceive as if the email was sent on Friday April 9, 2021 at 7.40am instead of… 17.40 hours by inculcating into the email screen grab a clear alteration or deletion of the number 1 and addition of the suffix AM."""	"“Bang' kawo thuolo kendo nono weche motudore gi kambino… noyud ni ne gitimo lokruok e email no mondo gichoch bod kendo miyo opar ni email no noornegi chieng' Tich Abich April 9, 2021 sa 1.40 okinyi kar mondo obed… 11.40 odhiambo ka girucho namba 1 e email ma ne gikopono kendo giloko ni ne oore okinyi."""
She added that because of failure to submit all the requirements, China Gezhouba was dismissed as a non-responsive bidder and hence its bid was not considered. 	Ms Obonyo nomedo wacho ni nikech kambi mar Gezhouba ne ok ochiwo gik moko duto mane dwarore, ne ong'ad kare oko kendo wachne norumo gi kanyo.
“From the foregoing, the applicant did not meet the preliminary responsiveness and mandatory requirements… the applicant’s bid could therefore not proceed for technical evaluation,” says Ms Obonyo.	Ms Obonyo wacho ni, “Kochakore gi wach loko email, kambino ne ok ochopo gik moko duto ma ne dwarore e yudo tijno… kwayo ma ne gioro ne ok nyal chopo e okenge man nyime.

The Soin-Koru dam, which has been in the works for years, is supposed to be put up along the River Nyando in Kisumu County to contain perennial flooding as well as improve water access for residents.

It is also expected to expand rice farming in Kano Plains.	Bende ne odhi konyo e puro mchele e alwora mar Kano.
In the tender documents, the authority said it was working with a budget of Sh23 billion, including taxes, to build the government-financed dam. 	E foms mag tijno, jotelo nowacho ni gigoyo bajet maromo bilion 23 mondo okony e wach gero yaono moriwo nyaka weche mag osuru.
“The Soin-Koru Dam is a multi-purpose project that will reduce the perennial flooding on the lower reaches of River Nyando. It will also supply water for domestic, irrigation and hydropower generation,” it said.	Nondik e fom-go ni, “Yao mar Soin-Koru biro konyo e gik mang'eny kaka chiko ohula ma betga e alwora ma mwalo mag Aora Nyando. Bende, obiro miyo ji oyud pi ma gitiyogo e utegi, e puothe, kaachiel gi loso sitima.”
The dam with a water storage capacity of 93.7 million cubic metres will provide 72,000 cubic metres of water per day for domestic and institutional use.	Yaono ma ting'o pi ma romo lita milion 93.7 biro miyo ji oyud pi ma romo lita 72,000 ma ginyalo tiyogo e utegi kod tije mamoko pile ka pile.
The water authority had started the tender process last year but was forced back to the drawing board after all the bidders failed to meet minimum set standards.

“Flooding is a frequent phenomenon in the lower reaches of the Nyando River Basin and poses problems to the communities especially in the lower zones of the river basin,” said the authority in the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) lodged with the National Environment Management Authority.

A 2009 report by the Ministry of Water quantified the impact of floods on the lower reaches of River Nyando, noting that it displaced 5,000 people annually and left them with losses of about Sh49 million due to damage to property.	Ripot ma higa 2009 ma nogol gi migawo mar Ministry of Water nowacho ni ohula ma bedoga e alwora ma mwalo mag Aora Nyando, daroga ji 5,000 higa ka higa kendo kethoga mwandu ma dirom siling' milion 49.

The Nyando flooding also interfered with the seasonal patterns of agriculture, threatening livelihoods and food security in the area, according to the water authority.	Kaluwore gi migawo mar  water authority, ohula ma Nyando keloga oseketho weche mag pur bende to mano osemiyo dak e alworano kod yudo chiemo obedo matek.
The flood water also destroys infrastructure as well as a general disruption of socio-economic activities, with the residents required to evacuate from their homes whenever there are heavy rains.

“Apart from constant flooding, the lower reaches of the Nyando River are also plagued by prolonged drought spells resulting in scarcity of water for irrigation,” said the authority in the ESIA.	Migawo moro e ESIA nowacho ni, “Mopogore gi ohula, alwora ma mwalo mag Aora Nyando bedoga gi kinde mag oro ma miyo yudo pi ma inyalo tigo e weche pur bedo matek.
“During the period, the Nyando River flow is low and a number of irrigation schemes in the area cannot operate at full capacity, especially in lowers areas of Kano Plain where there are rice paddies.”	“E kinde kaka mago, pi bedo manok e Aora Nyando kendo mano miyo tije pur mitimoga e alworago ok nyal dhi maber, to moloyo e alwora mag Kano ma ipidhoe mchele.”
It added that water from the dam had potential to increase the area under irrigation from 1,800 hectares to 5,170 hectares in and around Ahero and West Kano Irrigation schemes.  	Nomedo wacho ni pi yao nyalo miyo ji omed weche pur koa e eka 1800 nyaka eka 5,170 e Ahero kod alwora mage, kaachiel gi puothe mag mchele ma yudore West Kano.
The free M-Pesa transactions for amounts below Sh1,000 at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic last year weighed down on Safaricom’s overall earnings for the year ended 2020.

During this period, Safaricom enabled Kenyans to reduce the impact of the pandemic by waiving fees for transactions below a Sh1,000, which saw free transactions worth Sh4.4 billion processed.

Service revenue, mostly from voice and data, recorded a marginal decline of 0.3 per cent to close at Sh250.35 billion driven by double-digit growth in mobile data business, which grew by 11.5 per cent to Sh44.79 billion.

M-Pesa accounted for 33 per cent of the total service revenue down from 33.6 per cent last year, impacted by the waiver of the peer-to-peer transactions fees.

On regional expansion, Safaricom is leveraging on a new consortium to make an entry into the vast Ethiopian telecommunications market, to help it grow its revenues and market share to a new high.	E wach yaro alwora, Safaricom temo holo pesa mondo gidonj e riwruok moro manyien mar timo ohala e weche tudruok gi jo Ethiopia, mondo gimed yudo ohala mang'eny kendo shares maggi bende omedre.
In a statement released in April, the Ethiopian Communications Authority (ECA) said Safaricom was one of the members of a consortium that includes Vodacom Group Ltd (South Africa), Vodafone Group Plc (UK), CDC Group Plc (UK) and Sumitomo Corporation (Japan) that submitted bids for a nationwide telecommunication service licence.	Ripot moro ma nogol April gi migawo mar Ethiopian Communications Authority (ECA), nowacho ni Safaricom ne en achiel kuom joma nie riwruok moro moriwo Vodacom Group Ltd (South Africa), Vodafone Group Plc (UK), CDC Group Plc (UK) kod Sumitomo Corporation (Japan) ma nooro kwayogi mar manyo laisens mar timo weche tudruok e piny mangima.
The licence will allow the winning bidder (s) to roll out telecommunication services in competition with the State-run Ethio Telecom on voice and data across Ethiopia’s 112 million citizens.	Joma oyudo laisensno ne dhi yudo thuolo mar chako tije mag tuodruok ka gipiem gi State-run Ethio Telecom e weche dudruok gi simu kata data gi raia mag Ethiopia ma kwan gi romo milion 112.
“Under these licences, service providers will have the right to provide any telecommunication service including voice, text and data using any technology whether fixed or wireless anywhere within Ethiopia and to send and receive telecommunications to and from outside Ethiopia,” stated the ECA while inviting for bids.	Ka ne gigwelo ji mondo ochak oro kwayo maggi, migawo mar ECA nowacho kama: “Joma nigi lisens biro bedo gi ratiro mar timo tije mag tudruok moriwo tiyo gi simu, oro mesej kata tiyo gi data ka gitiyo gi teknoloji e piny Ethiopia kata oro kendo yudo weche tudruok e piny Ethiopia kata e pinje mamoko.”

The uptake of chartered flights in the local market has been slow, denying operators an important revenue stream.	Joma nigi ndeke kaka mago yudo ohala matin ahinya e alworawa ka.
According to players in the industry, high costs drive away potential customers, who prefer the cheaper scheduled flights.	Ka luwore gi joma ni e kambino, bei ma malo riembo kastembe mang'eny mohero idho ndeke ma ting'o abiria nikech bechgi yot.
“Charter flights are relatively more expensive than regular scheduled flights. One has to cater for costs of the empty return legs,” says Kenya Airways acting Chief Commercial Officer Julius Thairu.

Nikech ng'ato nyaka chulo pesa mang'eny moromo chulo kombe duto ma ni e ndegeno.” .

“Over the last one year, there has been aggressive competition as airlines enter this space to utilise their idle capacity due to the pandemic. They are competing with traditional charter airlines whose operating models and years of experience make them more price-competitive.”	“E higa mokalo, piem osebedoe nikech ndeke mag abiria temo tiyo gi thuolo e yudo pesa mag kombe ma ni nono nikech tuo mar Korona. Gitemo piem gi ndeke mag haya ma osebedo gi lony mathoth kendo osetiyo kamano kuom higni mang'eny.”

The government has hinted at a new model of business for the tourism sector which might see convention centres, national parks and game reserves managed by private agencies.

Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala, while addressing the European Union Green Diplomacy Webinar yesterday, said the sector cannot run the business as usual owing to the pandemic.	Kowuoyo gi joma ne ni e romo mar European Union Green Diplomacy ma notim e mbui nyoro, Najib Balala ma en Cabinet Secretary mar Tourism nowacho ni ohalano ok nyal timore kaka pile nikech tuo ma sani okwako piny.
He said the industry has learnt more from Covid-19, which should inform changes on its business models.	Ohala mar Tourism osepuonjore gik mathoth nikech tuo mar Covid-19, to mano onego omi gilok yore ma gitimogo ohalano.
“The pandemic has taught us lessons. We have woken up to a new reality that we must change. Nobody is left out and anybody going to open up after the pandemic must be refreshed,” he said.	Najib Balala wacho ni: “Tuo mar Covid-19 osemiyo wapuonjore gik mang'eny. Oseyawo wang'wa kendo konyowa fwenyo ni nitie lokruoge monego watim.

The CS said the sector was eyeing new investments and exploring fresh business models that will ease entry into new markets and reduce operating costs as part of the transformative agenda to revitalise the business.

“Why is everything being done by one entity? Why don’t we outsource?” he posed.	Nopenjo niya: “Ang'o momiyo ng'ato achiel e ma timo gik moko te? Ang'o ma monowa kawo gik moko oko?”
Mr Balala noted that public-private partnerships offer good examples of how this new model can work - even questioning why the State still manages key facilities.	Mr Balala nowacho ni riwruoge mag public-private keto ranyisi maber e wi kaka onego otim ohalano, kendo gipenjore gimomiyo Sirkal pod tayo gik moko kendgi.
“Why does the government run a convention bureau or facility? Why don’t we outsource and make it more efficient,” he asked.	Nopenjo niya: “Ang'o momiyo sirkal e ma tayo kaka itiyo gi ute moger ni itimoe romo? Ang'o ma monowa keto jo oko e ma ota weche kaka mago.”
“Why does the government run a national park? These are the things that need to be corrected, and this is the time to think again.”	“Ang'o momiyo sirkal e ma tayo gik ma timore kama oketie le mag bungu? Magi e moko kuom gik monego otim ne lokruok, kendo ma e sa mar paro matut kuomgi.”
This new model will also see the government cut down on the number of institutions in the sector.	Yo manyien mar timo ohalono biro konyo sirkal golo kembe kod riwruoge mang'eny ma ok ochuno e migawono.
Balala said the idea is to have a lean team, and rely heavily on technology.	Balala nowacho ni gima duong' en bedo gi grup mar joma omi ratiro mar ng'ado paro mapiyo kendo kawo okenge ma dwarore, kaachiel gi tiyo gi teknoloji e weche duto.
“How do you ensure you are lean, effective and efficient? These things need to be rethought,” he said. 	Bende nowacho ni: “Ere kaka ng'ato nyalo ng'eyo ka en gi nyalo mar ng'ado paro piyo, e yo mowinjore kendo ma kare? Magi moko kuom gik ma onego opar matut kuomgi.”
If we continue with the same models as before the pandemic, I do not think we will be able to progress.	Ka po ni wadhi nyime tiyo gi yore ma ne watiyogo ka ne pok tuo mar Covid-19 obiro, onge dongruok ma wabiro timo.
The CS said the adoption of technology post-Covid-19 should go beyond Facebook and Twitter, noting that the whole business economy depends on applications.

“Actually sales applications. That is why the investment of broadband capacity and smartphones is very key,” said Balala.	"Balala nowacho kama: ""Wawuoyo e wi applications ma konyo e tudo kambi gi kastembe. Mano emomiyo dwarore ahinya ni waket pesawa e wach data kod simbe ma nyasani.”"
He observed that the government can adequately maximise its 6,000 staff without stretching them with the deployment of drones.	Nofwenyo ni sirkal nyalo medo tiyo maber gi jotich 6,000 ma en go ma ok ochuno ni oriemb moko kuomgi e tich.
He said Covid-19 has taught the sector the importance of the domestic market - necessitating a change in the business model.	Nowacho ni tuo mar Covid-19 osemiyo migawoni oneno ber mar timo ohala e pinywa, to mano nyiso ni nyaka watim lokruok e yore mag timo ohala.
“Nobody imagined that there is a market called the domestic market. Not only Kenya; we tried it but a lot of countries never appreciated their local and domestic clientele who are the people around you,” he said.	Nomedo wacho niya: “Onge joma oseparoga ni ginyalo mana timo ohala e pinygi ma ok ochuno ni gidhi e pinje mamoko. Ok Kenya kende; to kata mana pinje mamoko bende pok ohero timo ohala e alwora ma giaye kod kastembe ma a e alworagi.”
Bipartisan MPs spearheading minimum reforms before next year’s elections have identified at least ten non-controversial proposals in the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) Bill to pursue through a parliamentary route.

The creation of a Prime Minister’s position and two deputies, increase in allocation of funds to counties, creation of ward fund, restructuring the electoral agency, re-looking security laws and expediting corruption cases are top on their agenda.	Moko kuom weche moket e ondamo ma nyime gin kaka wach keto migawo mar Prime Minister kod jolupne ariyo, medo omenda ma dhi ne kaunti duto, keto chenro manyien mar bedo gi omenda ma dhi ne ward ka ward, timo lokruoge moko e yo mochan-go migawo mochung' ne weche yiero ma thurwaka, nono kendo pend chike motudore gi wach arita kuwe kod kaso wach kedo gi mibadhi.
Other issues include the number of constituencies, equalisation fund to the counties, the two-thirds gender rule and seven-year tax break for youthful entrepreneurs.

A similar process was done in 1997 through the Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group (IPPG) that led to peaceful elections the same year. 	Notim gima chalo kamano e higa mar 1997 kitiyo gi migawo mar Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group (IPPG) to mano nomiyo ji otimo yiero e yo mokue.
The caucus’s move is informed by recent High Court judgement that declared BBI-driven Constitution of Kenya Bill 2020 unconstitutional. 	Joma ni e grupno noyudo wach ma Kot Maduong' nong'ado ka giwacho ni BBI-driven Constitution of Kenya Bill ma 2020 ok oluwore gi chik.
A five-judge bench comprising Justices Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Teresia Matheka, Chacha Mwita and Jairus Ngaah declared BBI illegal, null and void, thus halting the political baby-child of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Handshake partner ODM leader Raila Odinga.	Bura ma nong'ad gi jong'ad bura abich ma gin Justice Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Teresia Matheka, Chacha Mwita kod Jairus Ngaah nonyiso ni BBI ok oluwore gi chik sirkal, kendo ok owinjore, nomiyo chenro ma Ker Uhuru Kenyatta ne nigo mar kedo e weche siasa  ne jatend Handshake kod ODM Raila Odinga odok chien.
Former National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale said the move sought to fast-track the reform process ahead of the 2022 General Election.	Aden Duale Former National Assembly majority leader nowacho ni nolos chenrono mondo olos weche mapiyo ka pok kinde Yiero Maduong' ma higa 2022 ochopo .
“Key among the reforms is a review of the electoral and security laws, including the role of police in elections, to stop what we recently witnessed in the some by-elections. We will then incorporate the pro-people ideas in the BBI Bill,” said Duale.	Duale nowacho niya: “Achiel kuom gik madongo ma ne onego olos ne en nono chike ma tayo yiero kod arita kue, moriwo nyaka migepe ma polis nigo e kinde yiero, mondo gigeng' moko kuom gik maricho ma notimore e kinde yiero moko ma notim machiegni. Kae to wabiro nono paro mag joma nigi lony e weche BBI Bill.”
He added that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) should be fully constituted one year to the General Election. He added they would also seek to have the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) in the law.	Nomedo wacho ni migawo mar Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) onego oket e chenro mag Yiero Maduong' kuom higa achiel. Bende nomedo ni gibiro kwayo mondo oket  Constituency Development Fund (CDF) e chik.

Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior told TheSunday Standard that apart from restructuring the IEBC, they would review other electoral laws, including conduct of elections, nominations, and dispute resolution.	Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior nonyiso jo gaset mar The Sunday Standard ni mopogore gi chano migawo mar IEBC, gibiro nono chike ma moko ma tayo weche kura, moriwo nyaka kaka itimo yiero, nomination, kod kaka iloso ywaruok ma nitie.
He said they were still mulling over bringing the Executive into Parliament and whether it would need a referendum.	Nowacho ni ne pod giparo e wach keto Executive e Parliament kod ka be biro dwarore ni otim referendum.
“We will look at all the issues and review what can pass and avoid those that need a referendum because it is not easy to hold it before elections,” he said.	Nowacho niya: “Wabiro nono weche duto kendo neno ni gik mage ma owinjore okal mondo wageng' gik monego otimnegi referendum nikech timogi ka pok kinde yiero maduong' ochopo ok yot.”
The group brings together senators Kilonzo Jr, James Orengo (Siaya), Mithika Linturi (Meru), Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi) and Aaron Cheruiyot (Kericho).

Legislators include Gatundu South’s Moses Kuria, Abdulswamad Nassir (Mvita), Sakwa Bunyasi (Nambale), Shadrack Mose (Kitutu Masaba), Soipan Tuya (Narok Woman Rep), Cecily Mbarire (nominated) and Otiende Amolo (Rarieda).

Kuria said the creation a Prime Minister’s position through a parliamentary process was feasible given that all they need is to create a position of a chief minister and rename it.	Kuria nowacho ni loso migawo mar Prime Minister kitiyo gi chenro mar parliament en gima yot  ka po ni gik ma dwarore en mana loso migawo mar chief minister kae to ilokone nying.
“There is nothing that stops Parliament from creating the position,” said Kuria.	Kuria nowacho niya: “Onge gima nyalo mono Parliament loso migawono.”
The BBI process had sought to change at least 78 clauses of the Constitution but Sakaja said they had isolated those that were controversial and would ask different stakeholders what their irreducible minimums were.	Chenro mar BBI nochano mar loko paragraf 78 mag Constitution kata kamano Sakaja nowacho ni ne giseketo tende paragraf ma kelo ywarruok kendo ni obiro penjo party mopogore opogore paro ma gin go e wi wech ma ok nyal loki.
“Issues like doing away with an Ombudsman in the Judiciary, creation of 70 constituencies, two-thirds top up in the National Assembly and Senate and the issue of male and female senator reverting to woman representative as it was are controversial but we will navigate through them,” Sakaja said.	"Sakaja nowacho niya: “Weche kaka golo Ombudsman e Judiciary, loso constituencies 70, kwan mar ariyo kuom adek e migawo mar National Assembly kod Senate kaachiel gi wach mar golo chenro mar bedo gi chwo kod mon ma gin seneta mondo ji odog e chenro mar bedo gi mine ma ng'iyo dwach joma mon mong'ere kaka woman representatives, gin weche ma kelo ywaruok kata kamano ibiro non wachgi."""
The strengthening of provisions on the formula of creating constituencies in Article 89 to ensure equality of vote and increase constituencies by 70 and let IEBC determine the distribution in strict adherence to the formula was also on the table.	Bende achiel kuom weche ma ne opedhi ne en wach medo bero chike miluwo e loso constituencies ma yudore e Article mar 89 e yo ma biro miyo romruok obedie e kura kendo medo constituencies70 ka koni omiyo IEBC thuolo mar neno kaka gibiro pogogi ka giluwo machiegni ahinya chike moketigo.
“This will be a deliberative and consensus-building process over the next two weeks that will have people sitting together. A Constitution is about the people and should ideally be a consensus document,” said Sakaja.	Sakaja nowacho niya: “Mae en chenro mar gudo paro ma ji biro bedoe piny kanyachiel ka giloso weche kuom jumbe ariyo mabiro. Chike miketo onego oket dwaro mag raiya motelo kendo chutho chutho chikego onego okel winjruok e kind ji te.”
However, Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi accused a section of leaders in government and Opposition of scheming to scuttle the BBI reforms agenda.	Kata kamano,  MP ma Ugunja Opiyo Wandayi nodonjo ne jotelo moko ma nie sirkal kod joma kwedo chenro mar BBI nochano mar ketho ajenda mag BBI.
“Those who cobbled together the IPPG talks did so with the objective of scuttling the clamour for comprehensive reforms and they succeeded. That is why it took us another decade to realise the reforms we were fighting for in 1997,” said Wandayi.	Wandayi nowacho niya: “Joma noloso twege mag migawo mar IPPG nolosogi ka girikni kendo gigoyo koko nikech ne gidwaro ni golok kaka otiyo, to mano e gima notimore. Mano e ma omiyo nokawowa higni mang'eny mondo wafweny ni lokruogego ne otim nikech higa mar 1997.”
Wandayi, also the ODM secretary for political affairs, said they were wary of the new move.	Wandayi, ma en sekretari mar ODM, nowacho ni ne giparo ni yo manyienno nyalo kelo chandruoge moko.
“We are going to reject those attempts until the matter of BBI is concluded in the courts,” He added that any attempts to dismember the BBI through the IPPG would be rejected.	 Nomedo ni gibiro kwedo gimoro amora ma ng'ato timo mondo otiek BBI kotiyo gi migawo mar IPPG,  kowacho niya: “Ok wabi yie gi wechego nyaka wach BBI rum e kot.”
Prof Hassan Mwakimako, a board member of Muhuri, which also petitioned the BBI process in court, said Parliament slept on the job.	Prof Hassan Mwakimako, jakanyo mar bod mar Muhuri, ma bende nondiko ka gioro kwayo mar tero chenro mar BBI e kot, wacho ni Parliament nonindo e tich.
“They have woken up whereas we called on them from the word go to take charge of the process; now they are trying to reinvent the wheel.”	“Ne gichiewo mana nikech ne wachako luwgi mapiyo ma ok waweyonegi thuolo kata matin mondo ginon wechego;  sani koro gichako ng'iyogi kendo.”
Elegeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has challenged President Uhuru Kenyatta to visit every region in the company of his deputy to foster unity in the country.	Elegeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen nonyiso Ker Uhuru Kenyatta ni odhi e alwora duto mondo okel kue e piny.
Elgeyo-Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen on Saturday, May 29, told President Uhuru Kenyatta that elected leaders don’t have to be his friends to be recipients of development.	Elgeyo-Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen nonyiso Ker Uhuru Kenyatta chieng' Ngeso tarik 29 Mei ni ok ochuno ni jotelo moyier obed osiepene e ka giyudo ber ma dongruok kelo.
Murkomen termed as “unfortunate” remarks by President Kenyatta during his meeting with Luo Nyanza leaders on Friday, where he urged them to “take advantage of the Handshake” to get development projects.	"Murkomen nowacho ni weche ma Ker Kenyatta nowacho e romo ma notimo gi jotelo mag Luo Nyanza Tich Abich, kama nojiwogie ni “giti maber gi thuolo mar Handshake” mondo gitim gik ma kelo dongruok e alworagi, gin mana ""kuong'"" lilo."
Kenyatta met the Luo Nyanza leaders at State House, Nairobi ahead of Madaraka Day celebrations to be held in Kisumu on Tuesday, June 1.	Kenyatta ne nie romono gi jotelo mag Luo Nyanza e State House, Nairobi motelo ne nyasi mar Madaraka ma ne idhi tim Kisumu Tich Ariyo tarik 1 Jun.
Murkomen said development projects initiated by the national government should be independent of political alignments.	Murkomen nowacho ni tije ma kelo dongruok ma sirkal timo ok onego otud gi weche siasa.
“Why should development of any part of Kenya be dependent on personal relationships with the President?” the senator posed on Twitter on Saturday.	Senatano nondiko e Twitter chieng' Ngeso niya: “Ang'o momiyo dongruok mitimo e piny Kenya otudore gi winjruok ma ng'ato nigo gi Ker?”
Murkomen said uncompleted development projects in Rift Valley are likely to be abandoned because of the tense relationship between President Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto.	Murkomen nowacho ni tije ma nochak to pok orumo e provins mar Rift Valley nenore ni ok bi dhi nyime nikech winjruok ma ni e kind Ker Kenyatta gi jalupne, William Ruto nokethore.
“No wonder projects like Arror, Kimwarer, Itare, Bosto, Keben, Londiani Hospital have been killed,” he alleged.	Nowacho niya: “Mano e ma omiyo tije kaka Arror, Kimwarer, Itare, Bosto, Keben, Londiani Hospital nochung'.”
The lawmaker urged President Kenyatta to meet leaders from all regions in the company of his deputy to symbolise that the Executive arm of government is united.	Jalos chikeno nojiwo Ker Kenyatta ni ochan romo gi jotelo ma wuok e alwora duto mag jalupne mondo okonygi ng'eyo ni bad sirkal ma neno ni chike oluw pod nigi wijruok achiel.
Since independence, areas perceived to be opposed to the government of the day have been starved of development.	Chakre ne pinywa yud ohuru, alwora duto ma ne kwedo sirkal obedo ka onge gi dongruok moro amora.
This has led to uneven development across the regions with regions that have produced presidents more developed compared to regions that have not.	Mano osemiyo ongelore e pinywa ka alwora ma ji osewuokie mobedo Ker nigi dongruok moloyo alwora ma ng'ato pok owuokie mobedo Ker.
President Uhuru Kenyatta and Former Prime Minister Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga lead Kenyans in signing the BBI form during the National launch of the BBI signatures collection exercise at KICC in Nairobi County.	Ker Uhuru Kenyatta kod Former Prime Minister Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga notelo ne Jo-Kenya e pong'o fom mar BBI e kinde ma ne iketo ayanga National launch of the BBI signatures collection exercise ma notim KICC e kaunti ma Nairobi.
Even as the Court of Appeal hears the case against the determination of the five-judge Bench that paralysed the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill 2020, on May 13, Kenya is racing against time in its preparation for the next General Election.	Kata mana ka Court of Appeal ne winjo kes ma ne jong'ad bura abich ong'ado tarik 13 Mei ma ne paralysed Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill ma 2020,  Jo-Kenya lawo sa ka giikore ne goyo ombulu (General Election).
Sustained focus on the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), has however made it look as if the normal electoral processes and timelines were on hold.	Wach maduong' ma Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) oketo e pachgi miyo nenore ka gima yore mapile mag goyo ombulu oket tenge.
The country could easily find itself in a time bind, if key players do not begin paying attention to the elections, separate from the amendment Bill.  	Ne yot ahinya mondo piny oyudre ka gin e thuolo mar rito, po nono joma otelo e wechegi ok oketo pachgi e wi yiero, mopogore mana gi ng'iyo lokruok mag BBI monego otim.
Both the Constitution and the Elections Laws (Amendment) Act 2017 expect that in less than 12 months’ time from now, the country will be on the final lap of electing a new President, the 13th Parliament, as well as County Government bosses and the assemblies. 	Weche ma tayo Chike mag Kenya kod Chike mag Yiero ma 2017, dwaro ni kodong' dweche matin ne 12 kochakore sani, piny Kenya biro bedo e ondamo mogik mag yiero Ker manyien, Parliament mar 13, kaachiel gi jotelo mag County Government kod dwond buche mopogore opogore.
It is possible this consideration has occasioned Catholic Bishops to call for a shift of focus from BBI to the General Election.	Nenore ni Bishops mag Katholic nigi nyalo mar miyo ji ogol pachgi e BBI kae to giket motelo wach Yiero Maduong'.
The Elections Laws (Amendment) Act 2017 requires that political parties shall nominate their candidates by May 9, 2022.	Migawo mar Elections Laws (Amendment) Act ma higa 2017 dwaro ni chop tarik 9 Mei higa 2022 obi oyud ka parties mag siasa oseyiero joma gidwaro ni olar kom mar Ker.
The systems must gather organised pace before close of this year, both at the IEBC and in political parties, if the country will have an orderly election in August next year. 	Migawo mar IEBC kod dwond buche mag siasa onego bed ni osechano maber kaka ibiro tim yiero ka pok higani orumo, ka po ni gidwaro ni ji obi ogo ombulu e yo mochanore chop Agost higa manyien.
Section 13(1) of the amended law reads, “A political party shall nominate its candidates for an election under this Act at least ninety days before a General Election under this Act, in accordance with its nomination rules.” 	Kare mar 13(1) mar chike moselok wacho ni, “Dwond bura mar siasa ma luwo chik ma higa 2017 onego obed ni oseyiero ng'ama gidwaro ni okaw kom Ker kodong' ndalo piero ochiko ka pok kinde Yiero Maduong ochopo, ka luwore gi chike mag yiero.”
Because the next election falls on August 9, 2022, parties must hold their primaries by May 9 at the latest. This means they have 11 months to get their act together.	Nikech kinde yiero maduong' ma luwo en tarik 9 Agost, 2022, dwond buche onego ong'e joma gibiro goyonegi ombulu chop tarik 9 Mei kolewo ahinya. Mano nyiso ni gidong' mana gi dweche 11 e timo kamano.
Among other things, this entails polishing up their membership registers and sprucing up nomination rules for submission of both to IEBC within the statutory timelines.	E wi gik ma moko, mano oriwo loso rigista kendo neno ni chike ma tayo yierogo ne migawo mar IEBC e kinde moketi.
According to Section 28(a) of the Act, membership lists must be with IEBC at least 120 days before the election.	Kaluwore gi chikego e Kare mar 28(a), IEBC onego oyud list mar joma ibiro gonegi ombulu kodong' ndalo 120 to chieng' goyo ombulu chopo.
This places the last day of submitting the lists on March 19, next year. 	Mano nyiso ni tarik 19 Mach higa ma biro, e ma biro bedo tarik mogik mar chiwo listgo.
Nomination rules for party primaries, on the other hand, must be with IEBC six months before the election day, in line with Section 27 of the Act.	Mopogore gi mano, migawo mar IEBC onego oyud chike ma nyiso kaka oyier jogo kodong' dweche auchiel to ji goyo ombulu, kaluwore gi Kare mar 27 mar Chik.
The rules will, accordingly, be with the commission by February 9. 	Mano nyiso ni onego giyud chikego tarik 9 Februar.
It is a rat race for political parties to get their own houses in order, barring which they could find themselves locked out of the elections. 	Dwond buche mag siasa nyaka rire mondo gine ni giikore moromo, nono to ok gibi yudo thuolo mar chiwo ng'at ma gidwaro goyone ombulu.
Nomination rules not with IEBC by February 9 will not be recognised.	Ka po ni tarik 9 Februar oyudo ka pok gimiyo migawo mar IEBC chikego, mano kargi olal nono.
That means the party will not field candidates, as there will be no basis.  	Tiende ni dwond burano ok bi chiwo ng'atgi, nikech biro yudo ka oselor thuolono.
Parties will especially, note keenly that the courts are becoming very strict about processes, as the condemnation of the BBI process demonstrated.	Dwond buche biro fweyo ni kot rido chik e weche kaka mago nikech gima ne otimore ne chenro mar BBI.
A political party that decides to amend its nomination rules will have to wait for 90 days to lapse, from the day when it submitted the amendments to IEBC, in line with Section 27(b) of the Act.	Dwond buche mong'ado ni gidwaro loko chike ma tayo kaka gitimo yiero biro rito nyaka ndalo piero ochiko okal kochakore gi chieng' ma gioro ne IEBC kwayono, kaluwore gi Kare mar 27(b) mar Chik.
The last day for amending party primary rules is, therefore, May 9, 2022. 	Mano nyiso ni tarik 9 Mei higa 2022, e tarik mogik ma dwond bura moro nyalo lokoe chikegi.
But the original rules will have been submitted on or before March 19. 	Kata kamano, chike mokwongo to ibiro chiw tarik 19 Mei kata ka pok tarigno ochopo.
The advent of BBI, with the controversial political debates around it over the past three years, has skewed focus from statutory and constitutional political affairs to an extent that could push the next General Election into a tempest of a time rush, even for IEBC itself. 	Ka ne wach BBI osieko mbekni ma josiasa osebedo ka goyo e wachno kuom higni adek osemiyo ji oweyo wach nono chike ma diketi e kueyo ywaruok mag siasa ma thurka, e okang' ma nyalo kelo rikni e wach Yiero Maduong' mabiro ma en pek ma nyalo kata mana mwomo IEBC owuon.
Competitive, and often hostile, public debate within the political elite class has made it almost look like there can be no General Election before the conclusion of the BBI process.	Mbaka maliet kendo ma opong' gi weche gero ma osebedo ka dhi nyime e kind josiasa, miyo ji paro ni Yiero Maduong' ok bi timore ka pok otiek weche BBI.
Equally significant is what seems to be the assumption that if the BBI Bill is subjected to a national referendum, it will invariably sail through and everything else will follow.	Mano bende e gima ji paro ni biro timore ka po ni BBI Bill odhi nyaka e referendum, weche ok bi lokore kar mano gik mamoko duto biro dhi nyime kaka pile.
Should the Bill be defeated at a referendum, it could throw the country into a spin, if the rest of the election timelines have not been followed. 	Ka po ni olo BBI e referendum, obiro lalo piny duto, to ahinya ahiya ka ok oluw kinde moseket mag goyo ombulu.
But success could also lead to a messy set up, for there is little time left to the fulfilment of statutory electoral requirements.	To kata ka po ni olocho, pod onyalo miyo ji otim gik moko e yo ma ok ochanore, nikech odong' kinde matin ahinya mag chopo chike mag goyo ombulu.
That could explain why some political gadflies have made muffled pronouncements about extending the life of the present parliament, to make room for any subsequent legislation from BBI and give enough room to prepare for the General Election.	Mano leronwa gimomiyo josiasa moko osebedo ka umo lendo moko e wi medo ne parliament ma sani thuolo momedore mar tiyo, mondo giyud kaka ginyalo chopo chike mag BBI kendo yudo thuolo momedore mag ikruok ne Yiero maduong'.
In contemplating this, however, the political class may have to reckon with an outraged citizenry that could possibly be fatigued with the present regime, as usually happens when a regime’s tenure is ending.	Kata kamano, kuom paro matut e wi wachni, nyalo dwarore ni josiasa owuo gi jopiny ma wachno nyalo chwanyo, ma en gima jatimrega sama telo moro chopo e gikone.
In times of general economic and social hardship, the public tends to get a sense of relief from the thought that the government in power is about to give way to something new and probably more promising.	E kinde mag chandruok moro, ji ng'iyoga sirkal ma locho ka gigeno yudo konya matin kata mokalo ma giparo koa kuome.
Kenya is experiencing such times, compounded by the fallout of the Covid-19 havoc.	Kenya ni e chal ma kamano, komedore gi pek ma moko ma tuo mar Covid-19 osekelo.
Ordinarily, any proposed change of law does not stop institutions and processes from continuing to function in line with the existing law.	Gie sani, lokruok moro amora ma nyalo dwarore ni otim e chike ok bi mono riwruoge kod chenro mag goyo ombulu ma nitie sani, dhi nyime ka giluwo chike ma pod tiyo.
This is regardless that the changes, in the case of the Constitution, are proposed through a Parliamentary initiative or a popular initiative, according to Articles 255–257 of the Constitution of Kenya.	Bed ni lokruogego, kuom ranyisi Chike ma tayo piny, ochiw kokalo kuom Parliament kata kokalo kuom migawo moro machielo, kaluwore gi Sula 255–257 mag Chike Kenya.
A proposed constitutional amendment does not create a vacuum in the law. 	Lokruoge ma onego otim e chike mag Kenya ok ket bugo moko e chikego.
Kenya is, therefore, not in a constitutional void, despite the fact that there is a proposal to amend the law, supported by President Uhuru Kenyatta and a powerful slew of the political class in the Opposition. 	Kata kamano, chike mag Kenya ok gin chike ma nono, kata obedo ni nitie lokruok moko monego otimnegi ma Ker Uhuru Kenyatta kaachiel gi chike ma jo siasa ma ni e  dwond buch ODM.
The real danger for the country resides in the possibility of rushing to a chaotic General Election, the necessary orderly processes having been slowed down by overwhelming focus on BBI.	Chandruok maduong' ma piny nyalo bedogo en, iko gige yiero maduong' ka girikni to mano biro miyo yierono okel tungni, ka chenro ma nyalo kelo kue okalie ng'wech mana nikech ji oketo pachgi ahinya e weche BBI.
That BBI is itself presently stalled in court corridors is a damper on the process. 	BBI ma ne osechung wachne e kot e ma mono chenrono dhi nyime.
Still, it stands a fifty-to-fifty chance of being resuscitated, as are all matters before the courts.	Kata kamano, pok ong'ad kare chuth kendo inyalo chiere kendo, nikech weche duto pod ni e lwet kot.
In the event that it survives the present setback, this would still not be adequate cause to slow down the electoral process.	To ka po ni gitony e wach ma monogi dhi nyime ni, mano ok nyis ni gibiro dwoko chien chenro mar goyo ombulu.
For, the electoral process is protected by the Constitution and the various relevant Acts, with the Elections Laws (Amendment) Act 2017 ranking foremost in statutory law.	Chenro mar goyo ombulu orit gi chike mag Kenya kod Chike ma moko motudore kode ka Elections Laws (Amendment) Act ma 2017 ni e ondamo ma nyime e kind chike mopwodh gi buche ma loso chieke.
The recent jump starting of the process to populate the commission in line with the Constitution and the Act signals the hope that all is not lost.	Chenro ma nyocha ochak machiegni mar medo komisona mag IEBC ka iluwo chike motudore gi wachno en gima nyiso ni weche pod nyalo losore.
For its part, the commission reports that it has developed the Elections Operations Plan (EOP) for the General Election, and the Boundaries Operations Plan (BOP).

Procurement and mass voter registration activities are expected to be done “on budget availability.”	Chenro kod tije mag kawo nying joma biro goyo ombulu onego ochakre “ka osegol bajet” mar goyo ombulu.
Continuous Voter Registration (CVR ) is said to be ongoing at constituency offices, all the time, except for where there are by-elections. 	Wachore ni migawo mar Continuous Voter Registration (CVR ) dhi nyime gi tich e ofise mag constituency, seche te kendo kuonde duto mak mana e alwora ma timo yiero mag weche mosieko apoya.

Finally, the first tranche of the 2022 General Elections budget is expected to be included in the 2021-2022 financial year budget, to be read in a few days from now.

Regardless, the commission has massive work ahead.	Mopogore gi chal ma gintie, migawo mar weche ombulu pod nigi tije mang'eny ma pod onego gitim.
It has not done any mass registration of voters, as it admits.	Pok gichako timo registration mar jogo ombulu, mana kaka giwacho.
Ahead of the 2017 elections, mass registration was done in 2014 and 2017, despite the existing provision for continuous registration.	Motelo ne yiero ma higa 2017, tij kawo nying ji mathoth kiikogi ne goyo ombulu nochak tim e higa mar 2014 kod higa mar 2017, kata obedo ni thuolo mar timo kamano osebedo ka nitie kinde duto.
The law requires that such registration should be done and that registers must be open for inspection, at least 90 days to the election day. 	Chik dwaro ni okaw nying ji, kae onon nyingego kodong' ndalo 90 to ji timo yiero maduong'.
Registers were a huge bone of contention in the 2017 election controversies between NASA leaders on the one hand and Jubilee Party and IEBC on the other.	Ndiko nying ji ne okelo miero e ombulu ma higa mar 2017, e kind jotend NASA ma  ne ni konychiel kae to Jubilee Party kod IEBC koma chielo.
The country could be headed the same way again. Likewise, procurement issues seem to be in a dark place.	Mano gima nyalo timore e pinywa kendo. Mana kaka kinde mokalo, chenro mar loso weche pod ni e mudho.
In 2017 IEBC faced a plethora of pre-election litigation regarding procurement.	 E higa mar 2017 migawo mar IEBC ne nigi ywaruok mathoth e wi yore mopwodh gi sirkal mag timo yiero motelo ne Yiero Maduong'.
It is instructive that the process then began in 2016, unlike today when it is not even clear when the process is set to begin.	Nenore maler ni nochak los wechego e higa mar 2016, to mano opogore gi sani ma pok ong'e kata ni ibiro chak timgi karang'o.
As soon as IEBC invited tenders through advertisements, it found itself in court, landed with 50 cases that challenged the stages of procurement. 	 Mapiyo bang' ka migawo mar IEBC nosegwelo ji mondo oor kwayogi ne tijego, ne giyudore e kot, ka odonjnegi gi kes ma romo 50 ma kwedo okenge ma ne gitiyogo e loso wechego.
There was also legalistic wrestling with the of Public Procurement Advisory and Review Board over procurement.	Bende, ne gin gi ywaruok gi migawo mar Public Procurement Advisory kod Review Board e wi kaka ne giyudo thuolono.
The board cancelled the award of printing of ballot papers to Al-Ghurair Printing and Publishing Company of Dubai. 	Migawo mar Review Board noketho thuolo ma ne omi kambi mar Al-Ghurair Printing kod Publishing Company of Dubai mar goyo otese mag ombulu.
The courts also cancelled further awards, at least twice.	Bende, kot noketho thuolo mamoko ma ok tin ne ariyo ma ne omi kembe mamoko.
Repeat drama could be in the offing.	 Nenore ni gik ma kamago biro nwore kendo higani.
Meanwhile, NASA had a raft of 11 items dubbed “irreducible minimums.” 	Kata kamano, NASA ne nigi weche moko 11 ma giluongo ni “gik ma ok nyal loki.”
They wanted them addressed before they could participate in repeat presidential poll of October 2017.	Ne gidwaro ni owuo kuom wechego ka pok gidok e yiero mar ker ma ne idhi tim Oktoba higa mar 2017.
Some of the more critical concerns pertained to the ICT framework and its use at various stages, the manner of printing various forms and the details, as well as how they should be used and appointment of returning officers and, most important, result transmission. 	Weche mamoko ma korgi tek ma ne chando migawo mar ICT kod kaka itiyo kodgi e kidienje mopogore opogore ne gin, yo ma ne idhi tigo e goyo foms mag ombulu kod kaka ne gidhi chalo, kaka ne idhi ti kodgi kod kaka ne idhi yier joma tayo weche yiero kod lendo maggi, to moloyo duto, kaka ne idhi or dwoko mag yiero motimno.

During the funeral of Mombasa-based businessman Gregory Kipruto Koech on Wednesday, politicians used the podium to send conciliatory messages, urging Raila Junior to prevail upon his father to form an alliance with Ruto ahead of the 2022 General Election.

Nandi Governor Stephen Sang, Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi and local MCAs recalled how the two leaders worked together during the 2007 elections where Ruto played a key role in the 'Pentagon', a political grouping that helped Raila clinch the PM position in the Grand Coalition government.	Gavana ma Nandi Stephen Sang, MP ma Kapseret Oscar Sudi kod MCA ma wuok e alworan, paro kaka jotelo ariyogo notiyo kanyachiel e kinde goyo ombulu ma higa 2007, kama ne Ruto omako kama duong' e 'Pentagon', ma en grup mar josiasa ma nokonyo Raila yudo kom mar PM e sirkal mar Grand Coalition.
Sudi said it was high time Raila backed Ruto's ambition to take over power from President Uhuru Kenyatta next year.	Sudi nowacho magi gin kinde ma koro Raila onego oriw lwedo paro ma Ruto nigo mar kawo loch higa manyien bang' Ker Uhuru Kenyatta.
“In 2008 Ruto campaigned for Raila and he became Prime Minister during President Kibaki's Grand Coalition government. Next year, we expect him to support the DP to become the next president,” he stated.	Nowacho ni, “E higa mar 2008 Ruto notimo ne Raila kampein maratip mobedo Prime Minister e kinde sirkal mar Grand Coalition ka Ker Kibaki e ma ne ni e loch. Higa manyien, wageno ni en be obiro konyo Jalup Ker mondo obed e loch.”
“When you (Raila Odinga Junior) go back, ask your dad to consider supporting DP Ruto's presidential aspiration as a way of paying back the support the community gave him in 2008,” he said.

Governor Sang said there was a high possibility that Ruto and Raila could still work together in a new political realignment.	Gavana Sang nowacho ni Ruto gi Raila nyalo riwore mondo giti kanyachiel ma gikel lokruok e weche siasa.
While condoling with the family, Raila Junior urged youths to be innovative and invest in a business to get empowered. He also urged them to shun tribal politics.

“I have travelled all the way from Bondo to bury my friend and this shows how we are socially related despite our political affiliations. I want to tell young people to shun divisive politics.

The leaders – with increasingly strained relationship – met in public for the first time since February.	Jotelogo ok osebedo gi winjruok maber kendo mano e kinde mokwongo ma ne giromo chakre Februar.
Uhuru called on Kenyans to pull together for a prosperous country, while DP Ruto appealed for national dialogue to end political antagonism pitting proponents of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) and his Tangatanga camp.

The push to amend the 2010 Constitution has split the country into two rival camps, with Uhuru and ODM leader Raila Odinga leading the BBI proponents, while DP Ruto and his allies are on the opposing side.

He said it was only by coming together that the country will manage to achieve its agenda for growth.	Nowacho ni mano kende e gima biro miyo piny ochop agenda mage ma biro kelo dongruok.
“There is hope that it is possible to overcome if we pull together. One person cannot change Kenya, but together we will make a significant difference. I hope that those who are here and to all Kenyans who have had the opportunity to hear the teachings will live by them,” said Uhuru.	Uhuru nowacho niya: “Wan gi geno ni wabiro locho ka wakedo kanyachiel. Ng'ato achiel ok nyal loko Kenya, to ka watiyo kanyakla wabiro kelo lokruok maduong'. Ageno ni joma ni kae duto kod Jo-Kenya ma owinjo wechegi biro luwogi.”
He also called on MPs to fast-track legislation on Universal Health Care to ensure access to healthcare to all Kenyans, admitting that a majority of the population cannot afford medical care.

Ruto said disruption of political activities by Covid-19 could be a sign of divine intervention for the country’s leadership to begin dialogue so as to end wrangles.

“So many things have happened during this difficult period; the Tangatanga tours are not there and reggae has also stopped. I think we need to listen to what the Bishop was telling us,” said Ruto.	Ruto nowacho ni, “Gik mang'eny osetimore e kinde matekgi; grup mar Tangatanga oselal to weche reggae bende oserumo. Aparo ni onego wachik itwa ne weche ma Bishop ne onyisowa.”
He recalled how ODM leader Raila Odinga in an “uncharacteristic manner” read a Bible verse that called on leaders to “come and reason together” during the last prayer meeting.	Noparo kaka jatend ODM Raila Odinga nosomo ndiko moro e Muma e “yo ma ok owinjore” ka nodwaro ni jotelo “ochokre mondo gipor wach kanyachiel” e kinde mogik ma ne watimo romo mar lamo.
Muturi rallied leaders to unite for cohesive and peaceful country.	Muturi noriwo jotelo kanyakla mondo giked e kelo kue kod winjruok e piny.
He said that the Covid-19 pandemic that has disrupted livelihoods was enough reason for the country to come together in dealing with the common enemies.	Nowacho ni tuo mar Covid-19 mokwako piny ngima kendo ma osechocho ngima ji, onego obed gima miyo piny oriwre kanyachiel mondo giked gi wasikgi.

“Whoever did the appointments has already been annulled by the court,” said Wambora.	Wambora nowacho niya: “Ng'at ma notimo yierono kot nosegolo oko.”
Mohamud downplayed the fight, saying the two are still playing the roles they did before the Senate removed him from office. 	Mohamud notemo kueyo weche kowacho ni ji ariyogo pod timo migepe ma ne gitimo ka ne dwond buch Senate pok ogole e ofis.
“There are no two centres of power,” he said. “Both of us are accessing the offices but there is impunity on the side of the Executive who are reluctant to enforce law and order.” 	Nowacho niya: “Teko mar loch ok nyal bedo kuonde ariyo. Waduto watemo mondo wadog e ofisego to migawo mar Executive e ma osedigni kawo okang' mar neno ni oluw chik.”

“The threshold must be weighty enough. It must be a serious violation of constitutional provisions, which was not the case.

The development comes against the backdrop of another letter by ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna who castigated actions of the MCAs and change of leadership.	Lokruok noyudore e barua machielo ma nondik gi ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna ma nokumo MCAs abiriyoka kendo kelo lokruok e telo.
In a letter to Speaker Benson Mutura, Sifuna said the party had not sanctioned the changes and that he was conducting a probe into the actions of his members but requested that the status quo remains.	E barua ma nondiko ne Spika Benson Mutura, Sifuna nowacho ni dwond bura ne pok  otimo lokruoge kendo ni pod onono wach momako jogego kata kamano nokwayo ni weche pod ochung' mana kaka gin.
“Kindly note that the party has not made any changes to the leadership and the same did not originate from us,” Sifuna wrote.	Sifuna nondiko niya, “Dwaher ni ung'e ni dwond bura pok oloko telo moro amora kendo ni wach miwachono ok nowuok kuomwa.”
This comes even as the rebel MCAs plan to amend the assembly standing orders to rob political parties of the power to appoint minority and majority leaders and bestow it unto themselves.	Wechego timore kamano kata obedo ni MCA mong'anyogo chano loko chike mag bura mar kaunti mondo gima dwond buche mag siasa teko mar yiero jotelo mag minority kod majority mondo gin giwegi ema koro gibed gi tekono.
A letter by MCA Oyugi to the speaker revealed that there was a push to delete standing orders numbers 20 and 21.	Barua ma MCA Oyugi nondiko ne spika nyiso ni  nitie jokanyo moko mag bura mar kaunti ma ne chwalo weche mondo oruch chik namba 20 kod 21.
The changes are aimed at making the process of removing a leader complex and also make it difficult for political parties to hold accountable members that go against the party position.	Gidwaro ni gitim lokruogego mondo giket chenro ma biro miyo obed matek golo jatelo moro kendo miyo obed matek ne buche mag siasa kawo okang' ne jotelo ma pingo paro mar dwond bura ma entie.
If effected, the changes will have MCAs chose their leaders and not seek the approval of their political parties.	Kotim lokruogego, mano biro miyo MCAs thuolo mar yiero jotelo ma gidwaro ma ok gikwayo rusa kuom dwond buchegi.

Jubilee Party has announced that David Murathe has not resigned as party national vice-chairperson.	Jubilee Party nolando ni David Murathe pok oweyo bedo jalup jakom mar party national.
In a statement released on Wednesday, May 26 by party communication director Albert Memusi, the party termed false reports circulating on social media that Murathe had quit.	E ripot ma nogol Tich Adek Mei tarik 26 gi Albert Memusi ma en jatelo mochung' ne weche tudruok e party-no, party-no nowacho ni ripode ma landore kuonde tudruok e intanet ni Murathe nogolo nyinge gin miriambo.
“It has come to our attention that there are reports circulating on social media alleging that our vice-chair, Murathe. We would like to clarify that such reports are false,” read the statement.	Ripodno nomedo niya: “Wasewinjo ni nitie ripode ma landore kuonde tudruok e intanet ma wacho ni jalup jakom, Murathe otimo gimoro ma ketho chik. Dwaher wacho ni wechego gin miriambo.”
Memusi said Murathe was still the party’s able vice-chair and continues to carry out his duties in that capacity, working diligently to fulfil his mandate as provided for in the party constitution.	Memusi nowacho ni Murathe e ma pod en jalup jakom kendo pod odhi nyime timo tijene e migawono, kendo otiyo matek mondo ochop dwaro mag pati kaka chik dwaro.
The party urged members of the public to treat any documents, reports or communication purporting to convey his resignation with the contempt they deserve.	Dwond bura nojiwo jo pati ni gine weche, ripode kata gimoro amora ma ondik e wi Murathe mondo onyisgo ni oweyo migape kaka weche mag miriambo.
Memusi said any changes in the Jubilee Party leadership will be communicated through the official Party organs, as is the norm, and as is articulated in the Jubilee Party Constitution.	Memusi nowacho ni lokruok moro amora ma otim e weche telo mag Jubilee Party ibiro chiw kokalo kuom ofis joma noloso patino, mana kaka itimoga, kendo mana kaka ondik e chike mag Jubilee Party.
The reports emerged after President Uhuru Kenyatta reportedly made a phone call to top jubilee officials including Murathe and read him the riot act over the party’s loss in the two recent by-elections held in the Mt Kenya region.	Ripodno nowuok bang' ka Ker President Uhuru Kenyatta nogoyo simu ne jotelo mag jubilee moriwo nyaka Murathe kendo somone kaka ji ng'anyo nikech oyomb patigi e yiero matindo ariyo ma notim e alwora Mt Kenya.
Leaders have also called for party’s leadership changes following the Juja constituency and Rurii Ward by-elections.	Jotelo nokwayo ka inyalo tim lokruok e weche mag telo mag patino ka luwore gi yiero ma notim Juja constituency kod Rurii Ward.
In Juja, Jubilee candidate Susan Waititu managed 5,764 votes, losing to People's Empowerment Party (PEP) candidate George Koimburi who garnered 12,159 votes.	E constituency ma Juja, Susan Waititu ma ni e pati mar Jubilee noyudo ombulu 5,764, ka George Koimburi ma ni e pati mar People's Empowerment Party (PEP) noyudo ombulu 12,159 kendo kawo kom.
In Rurii Ward, UDA candidate Francis Muraya beat Jubilee's Peter Thinji.	E Ward ma Rurii, Francis Muraya ma wuok e pati mar UDA noloyo Peter Thinji ma wuok e pati mar Jubilee.
Murathe in January 2019 resigned his post as Jubilee Party vice-chairperson, saying he could not sit with Deputy President William Ruto in the party’s National Executive Council (NEC).	 Murathe noweyo bedo jalup jakom mar Jubilee Party Januar 2019, kowacho ne ok onyal bedo gi Jalup Ker William Ruto e National Executive Council (NEC).
The surprise resignation came on a day some Jubilee MPs demanded he either withdraw his utterances against the DP or be ousted from the party’s top position.	Notimo gima nomako dho ji chieng' ma MPs mag Jubilee ne dwaro ni okwa ng'wono nikech gik ma nowacho e wi Jalup Ker kata ogole e migawo ma malo e patino.
In May 2020, Murathe made a U-turn about his resignation saying President Kenyatta did not accept his resignation letter.	Mei higa 2020, Murathe nowere gi wach wuok e pati kowacho ni Ker Kenyatta notamore kawo barupe.
“I wrote a resignation letter to President [Kenyatta] but I have not received a response from the President indicating whether my intention was accepted or declined. This means that I’m still the party’s vice-chairperson and I will continue discharging my duties and responsibilities in the ruling party,” he said.	Nowacho niya: “Nandiko ne Ker [Kenyatta] barua mar weyo tich to pok ayudo dwoko moro amora moa kuom Ker ma nyiso ni noyie gi weche ma ni e baruano kata ooyo. Mano nyiso ni pod an jalup jakom mar pati kendo pod abiro dhi nyime timo migapa e patino.”
Nairobi County Assembly has approved a second Sh12 billion supplementary budget for pending bills and statutory payments.  	Nairobi County Assembly osegolo bajet mar ariyo maromo siling' bilion 12 mar gope ma pok otiek pwodh kod gik mamoko ma nyalo sieko.
The funds will be utilised by both City Hall executive and the Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) to settle debt obligations audited by the Auditor General's office.	City Hall kod Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) biro tiyo gi pesagoe chulo gope mosepwodh gi Auditor General's office.
In the first supplementary budget passed in April, Sh1.3 billion was set aside for the Major General Mohammed Badi-lead team to pay contractors and suppliers. 	E bajet mokwongo ma nogol April, noket siling' bilion 1.3 mondo Major General Mohammed Badi ochulgo jogedo kod joma ne kelo gige tich.
County Assembly Budget and Appropriations Committee chairperson Robert Mbatia said the second supplementary budget was drafted based on the directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta to ensure suppliers pay is not delayed.	County Assembly Budget kod jakom mar Appropriations Committee Robert Mbatia nowach ni bajet mar ariyo ne nondik ka luwore gi chik ma ne Ker Uhuru Kenyatta ogolo mar neno ni ochul joma kelo gige tich ma ok olewo.
“The second supplementary estimates of Sh12 billion will settle part of recurrent pending bills and amounts owed to development contractors,” said Mbatia.	Mbatia nowacho niya: “Bajet mar ariyo ma nyalo romo bilion 12 ibiro chulgo gope mamoko ma pod odong'  kod pesa monego ochul jogedo.”
Notably, Sh4.4 billion has been allocated towards settling Kenya Commercial Bank's (KCB) loan. 	Bende, siling' bilion 4.4 noket tenge mondo ochulgo lon mar Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB).
Another Sh1.2 billion will pay Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) debt while Sh381 million has been allocated to NSSF.	Siling' bilion 1.2 ne idhi chulgo gowi mar Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) kae to siling' milion 381 noket tenge ne migawo mar NSSF.
Mbatia also said re-allocations had been made across various votes in line with the provisions of Section 135 and 154 of the Public Finance Management Act (PFM) 2012, to make resources available for the payments.	Mbatia nowacho bende ni ka luwore gi ombulu mag kuonde  mopogore opogore nosenyis kaka idhi pog pesa kuonde mopogore opogore ka luwor gi Kare mar 135 kod 154 e Public Finance Management Act (PFM) ma 2012, mondo oik pesa ma ne idhi tigo.
The changes saw NMS budget reduced from Sh23.2 billion to Sh11.2 billion. 	Lokruogego nomiyo odwok bajet mar migawo mar NMS koa e siling' bilion 23.2 nyaka siling' bilion 11.2.
The committee further noted that the second supplementary budget was necessary to allow expenditure of the funds before the lapse of the current 2020/21 financial year on June 30.	Komitino nomedo wacho ni bajet mar ariyo ne dwarore mondo oyud kaka itiyo gi pesago ka pok ochopo tarik 30 Jun kama bajet ma 2020/21 chakore.
“The committee and indeed the County Assembly has been a strong crusader of the need for county government and the latter–day brother, NMS, to prioritise settlement of pending bills to also bolster the county’s credit score, while also guaranteeing that those who do business or work with City County don’t regret the decision,” Mbatia added.	Mbatia nowacho kama: “Komitino kod County Assembly osebedo ka kedo matek mondo sirkande mag kaunti kod migawo mar NMS  oket motelo gope monego ochul mondo okony e kungo pesa ma kaunti nigo, kendo neno ni jolok ohala kod joma tiyo e City County ok ywag ang'e e wi paro ma ne ging'ado.”
During debate, Kilimani MCA Moses Ogeto, however opposed the budget, saying committee had slashed NMS funds and this would hamper development.	E mbakano, MCA ma Kilimani Moses Ogeto, to notamore yie gi bajetno, kowacho ni komiti ne ong'ado pes migawo mar NMS to mano ne dhi miyo ok gibed gi dongruok.
"“This is a skewed presentation and I have never seen such a budget estimate paper before. Denying NMS funds is unreasonable,"" said Ogeto. "	"Ogeto nowach niya: “Mano paro mobam kendo pok anenoga bajet ma kamano nyaka nene. Kokwedo wach pesa ma nomi migawo mar NMS."""
Majority leader Abdi Hassan however said the supplementary budget was in order given that it had been presented before the house from NMS via the executive.	Kata kamano, Majority leader Abdi Hassan nowacho ni bajedno ne ni kare nikech ne ochiwe gi migawo mar NMS kokalo kuom jopwodh chike.
Eastleigh North MCA Osman Adow said passage of the budget would ensure pending bills are paid and revive stalled projects. 	MCA ma Eastleigh North Osman Adow nowacho ni okenge ma bajet kaloe biro neno ni ochul gope duto kendo chiero tije ma ochung'.
Roysambu MCA Peter Warutere said the funds will reduce the huge pending bills.	MCA ma Roysambu Peter Warutere nowacho ni pesago biro konyo e chulo gope madongo kendo miyo gidong' matin.
Impeached Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud and newly sworn-in boss Ahmed Muktar.	Gavana ma Wajir ma noketho chik sirkal Mohamed Abdi Mohamud kod bos ma ne oyier manyien Ahmed Muktar.
The political tussle in Wajir County deepened after impeached Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud and newly sworn-in boss Ahmed Muktar both claimed to be in charge of the county government.	Ywaruok e weche siasa e Kaunti ma Wajir  nojimbore bang' ka ne Gavano Mohamed Abdi Mohamud kod bos manyien ma noyier Ahmed Muktar wacho ni giduto ne oketgi e komno gi sirkal mar kaunti.
Muktar on Tuesday said he was legally in charge following the impeachment of his former boss – Mohamud – who separately claimed to be running the government, citing a High Court order stopping the swearing-in of the Deputy Governor.	Muktar nowacho ni nokete e kom kaluwore gi chik bang' ka nosegol Mohamud  ma bende noramo ni en e ma pod en gavana nikech Kot Maduong' nogolo chik ni mondo kik ket jalupne e komno.
But the order was reportedly issued after Muktar had already been sworn in.	Kata kamano, chikno nogol bang' ka Muktar nosechamo Muma.
Addressing a press conference in Nairobi, Muktar and a host of elected leaders from the county led by MPs Adan Keynan (Eldas), Rashid Kassim (Wajir East), Ahmed Bashane (Tarbaj), Prof Mohamud Sheikh (Wajir South) and Ahmed Kolosh (Wajir West) said the crisis was threatening tension in the region and appealed to Mohamud “to come on board as a citizen” and support the new team.	Kowuoyo e chokruok moro ma notim Nairobi, Muktar kod jotelo mamoko mawuok e kaunti matelne gi Adan Keynan (MP ma Eldas), Rashid Kassim (MP ma Wajir East), Ahmed Bashane (MP ma Tarbaj), Prof Mohamud Sheikh (MP ma Wajir South) kod Ahmed Kolosh (MP ma Wajir West) nowacho ni wachno ne miyo weche liet e alworano kendo nyiso Mohamud ni “obi e bod kaka raia” kae to oriw grup manyien lwedo.
Keynan said it was clear that the court order was in vain as it was already overtaken by events.	Keynan nowacho ni nenenore maler ni wach ma kot nong'ado ne en kayiem nono nikech nogole ka gik moko osetimore.
But speaking separately at the Council of Governors’ offices in Nairobi on Tuesday, Mohamud termed his impeachment a violation of the law, citing a court ruling that barred the process and a subsequent one blocking the swearing-in of his deputy.	Kata kamano, chieng' Tich Ariyo ka Mohamud ne wuoyo tenge gi ofis mar Council of Governors ma ni Nairobi, nowacho ni donj ma ne odonjnego ne en ketho chik, kolero ni kot nogolo chik ma ne kwedo wachno kendo chik machielo ma ne kwedo wach keto jalupne mondo okaw kare.
“The entire findings and resolutions of the Senate to remove me from office was rendered ineffective, inapplicable and non-operational. As such everything done pursuant to the resolution of the senate including the purported swearing in of the governor as the governor of Wajir has no effect,” he said.	Nowacho niya: “Weche duto ma Senate ne tiyogo mondo ogole e kom ne ok gin kare, kendo ne ok nyal tiyo. Omiyo gik moko duto mane gitemo tiyogo moriwo nyaka wach keto gavana manyien ma Wajir ne ok nyal tiyo.”
He further said he was ready to work with the newly sworn-in governor, saying he harboured no ill-feelings towards him or the county assembly.	Nomedo wacho ni noikore tiyo gi gavana manyienno, kowacho ni en noonge paro moro amora marach kode kata ne dwond bura.
“To my deputy governor, I know you as a humble person who has never shown any ill-intentions all along. I reaffirm that our relationship will remain the same as we continue to serve the great people of Wajir as mandated by law,” said Mohamud.	Muhamud nowachon kama: “Ne jalup gavana, ang'eyo ni in ng'ama muol ma pok obedoga gi paro moro amora marach nyaka nene. An gadier ni osiep ma ni e kindwa pod biro dhi nyime kaka wamedo dhi nyime tiyo ne Jo-Wajir kaka chik dwaro.”
The beleaguered county boss said he was perturbed by the behaviour of some politicians who hurriedly conducted and officiated an illegal swearing-in ceremony in an attempt to remove a popularly elected governor from office.	Jatelo ma chunye ne chandoreno nowacho ni iye nowang' gi timbe mag josiasa moko ma norikni timo nyasi mar pwodho ng'at machielo ka giketo e kom ka ok oluwore gi chik mana ni mondo gigol gavana ma noyier e kome mar loch.
Mohamud blamed his ouster on 2022 politics by a section of leaders, terming them “coup De’ tat tactics and maneuvers” citing an election petition against him in 2017 as the start of his woes.	Mohamud nokwedo chik ma nomiyo jotelo moko ogole e siasa ma higa 2022, koluongogi ni “coup De’ tat tactics and maneuvers” kosomo nyaka kwayo ma ne gindiko e higa mar 2017 ka gichako kedogo kode.
“This proves that my purported removal was well-engineered from the beginning,” added Mohamud.	Mahamud medo dwacho kama: “Mano nyiso ni weche ma nodonjnegodogo ne ochan maber koa e chakruok.”
The latest tussle comes in the backdrop of a decision by the High Court in Meru to refer the petition that sought to nullify the impeachment of the embattled politician to Chief Justice Martha Koome to form a three-judge bench to determine the matter.	Wach mogik ne oluwore gi gi ma Kot Maduong' ma Meru nowacho kowuoyo kuom kwayo ma ne ondikne Chief Justice Martha Koome kinyise ni olos bura moting'o jongad bura adek mondo onon wach golo jasiasa ma weche nolworo koni gi konino.
"""It is hereby directed that the matter be heard by more than one judge ….it shall henceforth be dealt with after the Chief Justice exercises mandate under articles 165(4) of the Constitution"", states the order issued on Monday."	"Chik ma nogol chieng' Wuok Tich wacho niya: ""Dwarore ni jong'ad bura mokalo achiel owinj kesno….kae to ibiro non wachne bang' ka Jang'ad Bura Maduong' osegolo chik kaluwore gi sula 165(4) mag Chike."""
Tuesday, Keynan fell short of blaming the High Court for issuing orders that cannot be enforced for being overtaken.	Chieng' Tich Ariyo, Keynan ne ok ochopo gombone mar keto ketho kuom Kot Maduong' nikech golo chike ma ok nyal konyo.
“Courts have held again and again that it cannot stultify itself by making orders which cannot be enforced or grant an injunction which will be ineffective for practical purposes… the court should have declined to grant it,” said Keynan.	Keynan wacho ni “Kot osewacho kinde ka kinde ni ok ginyal timo tim mofuwo mar keto chike ma ging'eyo maber ni ok nyal tiyo ka thuolo oneno… dine gikwedo wachno kata weyo ma ok gichiwe.”
“It was thus clear, that the applicants in the above-mentioned case failed to inform the court, or withheld material information that as of the time the orders were being sought, Governor Ahmed Ali Muktar had been sworn in and assumed office,” he added.	Nomedo wacho niya: “Omiyo nenore maler ni joma ne ooro kwayo e kes miwuoyeni ne ok onyiso kot kata golo gima ne nyiso ni e kinde ma ne igolo chikni, noyudo ka oseket Gavana Ahmed Ali Muktar kom mochako locho.”
Muktar said his former boss was removed from office due to his inability to offer services to the people.	Muktar nowacho ni jatende mar tich machonno nogol e ofis nikech ne ok okony ji kaka dwarore.
He said the removal was not politically engineered as claimed by the impeached county boss.	Nowach ni wach golo bosne e loch ne ok ochan kaka owacho.
"“There have been many serious issues in Wajir. Hospitals were closed, health workers were not at work. The people of Wajir faced some very small issues that any county government can handle. Ours now is to work on them and ensure they don’t happen again,"" Muktar said."	"Muktar nowach niya: “Wajir osebedo gi weche mathoth kendo mapek. Nolor osiptende, lakteche kod jorit jotuo ne ok dhi tich. Jo-Wajir ne nigi ywaruok e weche matindo ma ne ginyalo loso mapiyo. Tijwa sani en neno ni wechego ok omuoch kendo."""
The pro-Muktar team also cautioned the CoG against frustrating the will of the people of Wajir who made the decision to remove their governor from office.	Grup ma riwo Muktar lwedo bende nokwero migawo mar CoG mondo kik gichun Jo-Wajir ni gilok pachgi e wi paro ma ne gin go mar golo gavana margi e ofise.
There was drama at the venue of the governor’s press briefing when police wielding clubs and teargas canisters tried to eject the media from the Delta Towers premises to prevent them from covering the event.	Ne nitie ywaruok kama ne govanano wuoye gi jo press ka ne polise ma ne tiyo gi bunde kod teargas e riembo jofwamb weche ma Delta Towers mondo gigeng'gi kik gimak gik ma ne timore kanyo.
An officer who only identified himself as a chief inspector did not offer explanations as to why the press was almost chased out. 	Jatelo moro mane wacho ni en inspekta maduong' ne ok olero gimomiyo ne itemo riemb jofwamb weche.
The assumption of office of Chief Justice Martha Koome has completed the triumvirate leadership of the three arms of government; the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary raising concerns about regional balance and the face of Kenya in running the country.	Nikech koro Chief Justice Martha Koome osedonjo e telo, pinywa koro nigi jotelo adek ma tayo migepe adek mag sirkal; migawo mar Executive, Legislature, kod  Judiciary ywago matek wach bedo gi romruok e dongruok mar dhoudi ma thurka kendo tayo piny Kenya ka ji nie paro achiel.
Often viewed as a taboo topic, ethnic balkanisation for political gain remains Kenya’s biggest bane.	Pogruok e kind ogendni nikech weche siasa ma ineno kaka tim ma kwero, pod en chandruok maduong' momako piny Kenya.

One key requirement of the 2010 Constitution is for the President to table a report before Parliament yearly, on three issues during his State of the Nation Address is regional balance.

According to Article 132 on the functions of the President, he is obligated to address a special sitting of Parliament annually.	Kaluwore gi Sula mar 132 e weche ma Ker onego otim, en gi migawo mar wuoyo gi Bura ma Loso Chike (Parliament) mitimoga higa ka higa.
He is required to table: “report on all the measures taken and the progress achieved in the realisation of the national values, referred to in Article 10, publish in the Gazette the details of the measures and progress made and submit a report for debate to the National Assembly on the progress made in fulfilling the international obligations of the Republic.”	Dwarore ni ondik: “ripot e wi okenge duto mokaw kod dongruok ma gikelo e wi gik ma chik oyiego kod ma ok oyiego, kaka ilero e Sula mar 10, kendo keto wechego e Gazet kae to ochiw ripot ne Bura Maduong' (tiende ni National Assembly) e wi gik mosetim  e chopo ting' ma pinywa nigo e weche momako piny mangima.”
The furore of having President Kenyatta, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi and the latest Justice Koome coming from one region as opposed to having the seats spread over the seven other regions captures according to some elected leaders, the source of Kenya's ethnic problem.	Bedo ni Ker Kenyatta, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi kod Jang'ad bura Maduong' Koome wuok e alwora achiel en chakruok mar ywaruok e piny Kenya nikech jotelo moko kwedo wachno ka giwacho ni joma nie kombego onego owuog kuonde mopogore opogore e alwora abiriyo ma moko.
By law, Muturi, who was last week crowned as the Mt Kenya spokesperson, is third in the pecking order and would act as President in the absence of the President and the Deputy President.	Kaluwore gi chik, Muturi, ma noyier mondo owuo e lo ji e alwora mar Mt Kenya, en ng'at mar adek ma neno ni chike oluw kendo sama Ker kata Jalup mar onge onyalo tiyo e logi.

Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala caused a spectacle in the Senate when he listed top leaders holding various posts in the three arms of government, rattling Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi.

“I hope the BBI document will sort [out] the mess in the Public service. Facts are facts. Kindly Senator Wamatangi, today evening when you're free, ask yourself who is the head of the Executive, Judiciary, Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC) Speaker (National Assembly), CDF boss, Governor of CBK, Attorney General, Solicitor General, Kenyan Ambassador to the United States, Chair KRA, Director-General KRA, DCI, head of civil servants, state House Comptroller. Where is equity here,” posed Malala.	Malala nowacho niya: “Ageno ni barup BBI biro loso weche mochochni e tije sirkal.

Be opog telogo marom?”
He argued, “We cannot lie to ourselves. Ask yourself that question and you will come to the reality that there is marginalisation in this country. Security recruitment across the country, there has never been a Wanyonyi, Wafula or Walubengo as Inspector General of Police (IG).”	Nowacho niya, “Ok wanyal wuondore. Penjri ane penjono kae to ibiro fwenyo ni ibwono ji e pinywa ka. E weche mag arita kue, pok wawinjoga koket Wanyonyi, Wafula kat Walubengo mondo obed jatelo e migawo mar  Inspector General of Police (IG).”
Said Malala: “Is it that there are certain people from certain regions that are more qualified than others. It is a shame. Let us not use BBI to hoodwink some of us to pass it and go back to the normal practice. I want to see a day when a maize farmer in Kakamega is treated the same way as a coffee or potato farmer in Kirinyaga.”	Malala nowacho niya: “Dibed ni itimo mano nikech nitie joma a e alwora moko ma nigi lony mohingo jowetegi.

Senators Wamatangi and Ephraim Maina (Nyeri) could not let the matter fly, arguing that even Mt Kenya has suffered, including the colonial times. “Let’s not mislead this country by creating preferred or preferential treatment to some areas,” said Wamatangi.

When debating Clause 11 (A) in the BBI in the economy and shared prosperity, Senate Minority Leader James Orengo led colleagues Senators Malala, Moses Wetangula (Bungoma), Mutula Kilonzo Jnr (Makueni), Johnstone Sakaja (Nairobi) in calling for a more exclusivity public service.

“Of the last two months’ appointments made, I don’t know if we are going in the right direction. Every institution should reflect the face of Kenya whether Judiciary, public service or the security system. Our objective is to ensure the enabling provision call for the face of Kenya, which is fair than we have had,” said Orengo.	Orengo nowacho niya: “Ka luwore gi romo ma notim dweche ariyo mokalo, ok apar ka waluwo yo mowinjore.

“The report by the Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) tabled in the House show a large portion of Kenya is red and a small portion is green. There is a verse in the Bible, those who have will get more, those who have little, it shall be taken. This is the true story of Kenya,” Kilonzo Jnr said.	Kilonzo Jnr nowacho niya: “Ripot ma nogol gi migawo mar Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) ma nochiw e nyim bura, nyiso ni alwora maduong' e Kenya kwar to alwora matin majan.

He said there was unfair distribution, with Mt Kenya getting a lion’s share.	Nowacho ni ok opog gik moko e yo makare, alwora mar Mt Kenya omi gik mang'eny.
“It's a fact that there is 2,500km of tarmac roads in Kiambu while Kakamega only has 750km of tarmac,” he said.	Nowacho ni,“Nitie nderni mag lam ma romo kilomita 2,500 e taon mar Kiambu, to Kakamega ni mana gi nderni mag lam ma romo kilomita 750.”
Wetangula said they should not let facts be swept under the carpet and urged Maina and Wamatangi not to contradict the president and purport to support him at the same time.	Wetangula nowacho ni ok gibi ling' aling'a gi wechego, kendo nyiso Maina kod Wamatangi ni kik gikwed ker to komachielo giriwe lwedo.
“Uhuru and Raila sat and acknowledge the challenge of marginalisation, unequal development, unequal opportunity in Kenya and many other historical wrongs. When we live a lie, when we live in denial, we will not solve our problems,” he said.	Nowacho niya: “Uhuru gi Raila nobedo piny kendo winjore ni nitie weche kaka bwono ji, dongruok motim mana e alwora moko, yiero joma indiko tich e piny Kenya kod gik mamoko ma ne ok otim e yo makare.

Wetangula said it’s a fact there are those with comparative advantage. 	Wetangula nowacho ni adiera en ni nitie joma nigi nyalo mar timo gimoro maber moloyo jomamoko.
“Cowards will always whistle in the dark hoping to scare away people. The inequality we keeping crying about is real,” he added.	"Nomedo niya: “Joma luor liyo e mudho ka giparo ni gibiro bwogo ji. Timo gik moko e yo ma ok rom ne ji te en gima nitie adier."""
Nakuru Town West MP Samuel Arama has dismissed his colleagues' plan to impeach Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matiang’i later this week in the National Assembly.	MP ma Nakuru Town West Samuel Arama okwedo chenro ma jotich wetene nigo mar golo Dr Fred Matiang’i motelo e migawo mar Interior Cabinet Secretary giko jumani e Bura Maduong'.
Speaking after issuing bursary cheques worth Sh11.2 million to his constituents, Arama said that such a motion would be dead on arrival, citing that there are no sufficient grounds to oust the CS.	Bang' golo chek mag basari ma dirom milion 11.2  e constituents mage, Arama nowacho ni weche kaka mago biro chopo ka kindegi nosekalo, komedo ni onge gima inyalo tigo e golo CS e kome.
“I am surprised that my colleagues have hatched a plan to impeach Matiang’i over some flimsy grounds. They have forgotten an impeachment must meet a constitutional threshold,” said Arama.	Arama nowacho niya: “En gima kawa gi wuoro ahinya ni jotich wetena nochano golo Matiang’i nikech gimoro matin. Wigi wil ni golo ng'ato e kom en gima nyaka luwre gi chik.”
The MP said that a majority of those crying foul after years of cordial relationship with the CS had been denied opportunity to further their personal agenda.	MP Arama nowacho ni ng'eny joma osebedo osiepe CS kuom higni mang'eny kendo ma ne kwedo wach gole e kom, ne ok oyudo thuolo mar chopo gik ma ne gigombo timo.
“One of the MPs crying foul wanted the CS to allow him use the police to undermine other leaders. Matiang’i told him off and he has now turned against him,” said Arama.	Arama nowacho kama: “Achiel kuom MPs ma ne ok dwar wach golo Matiang'i e kom ne dwaro ni CS Matiang'i okonye tiyo gi polise e hinyo jotelo mamoko. Matiang’i notamore konye kendo koro sani okwedo Matiang'I ahinya.” said Arama.
The second term lawmaker pointed out that the appointing authority was confident in the way the CS performed his roles and was going for an even greater seat in 2022.	Jalos chik mosetiyo termariyono nowacho ni joma noyiero Matiang'i ne nigi adier ni CS no ne dhi tiyo maber kendo gichano miye migawo ma malo e higa mar 2022.
He accused those complaining over the Bonchari mini-polls of attempting to spark a revolt against Matiang’i in his own backyard.	Nodonjo ne joma ne ywak e wi yiero ma notim Bonchari ni ne gitemo ng'anyo ne Matiang’i e alworagi.
“The President is not complaining about him. Bonchari people are not complaining. It is only a few outsider MPs who went there with a motive to paint a bad image about the CS. Matiang’i will be on the presidential ballot in 2022 and they won’t stop him,” said Arama.	Arama nowacho niya: “Ker pok owacho gimoro marach kuome. Jo-Bonchari be pok oywakne. Mana MPs ma a oko e ma nodhi kuno gi paro mar mieno CS no gi chilo. Matiang’i biro bedo e list mar joma laro kom mar Ker e higa mar 2022, kendo onge ng'ama biro tame.”
He called on the leaders to instead respect the current leadership and the law to be on the right side without brushing police the wrong way.	Nowacho ni kar ketho nyinge to gimiye luor nikech telo ma en go sani kendo giluw gima polise wacho ni gitim.
“These are the same people who have since 2017 been hurling insults at President Uhuru Kenyatta. They seek attention by going where they know there will be a controversy,” he said.	Nowacho bende niya: “Magi e joma chakre higa mar 2017 osebedo ka kwinyo Ker Uhuru Kenyatta. Gidwaro ni ji oket pachgi kuomgi ka gidhi kuonde ma ging'eyo ni koko kata ywaruok biro wuokie.”
MPs Ngunjiri Wambugu (Nyeri town) on May 21 intimated that there was a plan to impeach the CS whom he accused of being rogue.	Tarik 21 Mei, MP (ma Nyeri) Ngunjiri Wambugu nowacho ni ne nitie chenro ma ne dhi mbele mar golo CS e kome kiwacho ni wiye tek.
“There is this one Cabinet Secretary who somehow thinks he’s untouchable. We get insulted here every day as we protect the government he works for, then he thinks he can run over us the way he runs over everyone else,” Wambugu wrote on Facebook.	Wambugu nondiko e Facebook kama: “Nitie achiel kuom jokanyo mag Cabinet Secretary ma paro ni en onge gima nyalo yude. Ji donjonwa kinde ka kinde ka watemo rito sirkal ma otiyone, kae to oparo ni onyalo nyorowa kaka odwaro mana kaka otimo ne jomoko.”
Ngunjiri who is associated with Kieleweke faction of the Jubilee Party, said they would join forces with Tangatanga faction and ODM to ensure the CS is voted out.	Ngunjiri ma nigi tudruok gi grup mar Kieleweke ma ni e dwond bura mar Jubilee, nowacho ni gibiro riwore gi grup mar Tangatanga kod ODM mondo gine ni ogol CS e kome mar loch.
His sentiments came barely two days after Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi announced the same plan on May 19, accusing the CS of abusing the police service and disobeying court orders in the past.	Nochiwo pache ndalo ariyo bang' ka MP ma Kapseret Oscar Sudi noselando chenro ma kamano tarik 19 Mei, ka gidonjone CS ni otiyo marach gi polise kendo oketho chik ma kot nogolo.
"“In all the by-elections that we have held in this country, Matiang'í has been sending thousands of police officers because he wants his preferred candidate to win. We shall impeach him in the next two weeks,"" said Sudi."	"Sudi nowacho niya: “E yiero matindo duto mosetim e piny ka, Matiang'í osebedo ka oro polise elufe nikech odwaro ni ng'at ma oriwo lwedo e ma oyomb e yiero moro. Wabiro gole e komeno jumbe ariyo mabiro."""
The Tangatanga faction has since their fallout with the Kieleweke faction cried foul over what they termed as selective discrimination by the police during mini-polls in Nakuru and Bonchari.	Grup mar Tangatanga mosebedo ka yware gi Kieleweke igi wang' matek mokalo ka giwacho ni polise nyocha dewo wang' ji e yiero matindo ma nyocha otimore Nakuru kod Bonchari.
Ex-Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi now terms his removal as malicious	Gavana ma chon ma Wajir Mohamed Abdi sani wacho ni joma ne ogole e telo ne dwaro mana kethone
Former Wajir Governor Mohamud Abdi during his impeachment debate at Senate chambers, Nairobi.	Gavana ma chon ma Wajir Mohamud Abdi e kinde ma ne igole e kom e romo ma notim e bura mar Senate, e boma ma Nairobi.
A cat and mouse game is playing out in Wajir County.	Tugo mar paka gi oyieyo timore e Kaunti ma Wajir.
Former Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi has now claimed that his impeachment was “well-planned”, terming it a political witch-hunt.	"Gavana ma chon ma Wajir Mohamed Abdi wacho ni chenro mar gole e kom en gima ""nochan maber,"" kendo ni notime mondo otieke e weche siasa."
In a televised address on Tuesday, Abdi, pointed an accusatory finger at some leaders in Wajir County who, he said, engineered his removal from office.	E weche ma nowacho chieng' Tich Ariyo kowuoyo e tv, Abdi, noketo ketho kuom jotelo moko ma wuok e Kaunti ma Wajir, kowacho ni gin e ma ne gichano wach gole e ofis.
“I’m perturbed by the behaviour of some Wajir leaders who orchestrated an illegal swearing-in to remove a serving governor from office,” he said.	Nowacho niya: “Dhoga omoko gi gima jotelo moko mag Wajir notimo, ka gichano nyasi ma ok oluwore gi chik kendo gimiyo ng'ato chamo Muma mana ni mondo gigol gavana ma ne ni e ofisno.”
Abdi decried disobedience of court orders, given that the High Court had barred the County Assembly and the Senate from impeaching him until a petition he had filed was heard and determined.	Abdi noywago wach chayo chike mag kot, nikech Kot Mamalo ne otamo Bura mar Kaunti kod Senate ni kik gole e kom nyaka bang' ka osetiek winj kwayo moro ma ne opedho e nyim kot ma kotno ng'ad bura.
The former governor had challenged his removal from office, a day after Senate upheld his impeachment.	Gavana ma chon-no nokwedo wach gole e kom odiechieng' achiel bang' ka Buch Senate ne ong'ado mar riwo lwedo wach gole e loch.
“The resolution by the Senate was rendered ineffective and inapplicable. As such, anything done in pursuit to that resolution on May 17, 2021, including the swearing-in of Wajir Deputy Governor, has no effect,” he said on Tuesday.	Chieng' Tich Ariyo nowacho kama: “Wach ma ne buch Senate ong'ado ne ok owinjore kendo ok nyal tiyo. Nikech gimoro amora ma otim mopogore gi wach ma nogol tarik 17 Mei 2021, moriwo nyaka keto Jalup Gavana ma Wajir e kom gavana, ne ok nyal tiyo.”
He also quoted last week’s orders by the Meru High Court stopping the swearing-in of newly appointed Governor Muktar Ali, which stated that he (Abdi) shall continue to be in office until his petition is heard and determined.	Nowacho nyaka weche moko ma Kot Maduong' ma Meru nowacho juma mokalo ka ne gitamore wach keto gavana manyien Muktar Ali e kom, ma ne wacho ni Abdi biro dhi nyime bedo gavana nyaka kot winj kesne kendo ng'ado paro.
His statement came just hours after Wajir leaders rallied behind Governor Muktar in a press conference, affirming their support.	Nowacho wechego bang' ka jotelo moko ma Wajir noselando ni ne gi dhi riwore gi Gavana Muktar e romo mar jo pres, ka ginyisogo ni gimakore kode.
“Governor Muktar is now firmly in office. Any order purportedly issued by the High Court blocking his assumption to office was overtaken by events,” said MP Adan Keynan.	MP Adan Keynan nowacho niya: “Gavana Muktar osekawo ofisno. Chik moro amora ma Kot Maduong' nogolo ma ne nyalo mone kawo komno, koro ne ok nyal konyo nikech, nogolgi ka chenro mar kete e komno noserumo.”
Last week, Abdi received support from the Council of Governors, who expressed discontentment in the manner in which his impeachment was conducted.	Juma mokalo, Abdi noyudo ripot mowuok kuom Council of Governors, ma nonyiso kaka ok ne gimor gi yo ma ne ogolego e kom.
"""The Senate has failed to set standards on what amounts to gross violation of the Constitution. For example, in the Kirinyaga case, the Senate acquitted the governor charged with similar violations,” CoG Chairman Martin Wambora stated."	"Jakom mar CoG Martin Wambora nowacho kama: ""Buch Senate pok owacho gima ka ng'ato otimo to nyalo miyo giwach ni ng'ato otimo richo maduong' koketho Chike ma tayo piny. Kuom ranyisi, e kes ma Kirinyaga, buch Senate nogonyo gavana ma nodonjne gi ketho machal gi mago.”"
But even as leadership wrangles rear their ugly head in Wajir, the impeached governor says he has no resentment towards Muktar, and reaffirms that their relationship “will remain the same”.	To kata bed ni jotelo ma Wajir yware e wi loch marach ma gin go, gavana ma nogol e komeno wacho ni ok obi chulo kuor ne Muktar, kendo owacho ni en gadier ni “biro siko”.
Nyamira County assembly is staring at another row after Governor Amos Nyaribo resubmitted the name of James Gesami for approval as his deputy.	Nyamira County assembly nono wach weche moko bang' ka Govana Amos Nyaribo nochiwo nying James Gesami kodwaro ni okete obed jalupne.
The assembly rejected Gesami in January with 21 voting against the nomination and only 15 supporting.	Dwond Bura nokwedo Gesami e dwe mar Januar ka ji 21 nodage to ji 15 kende ema ne osiro wachno.
And as the Assembly resumes sittings on June 6, it is not clear whether the MCAs will approve this time.	Ka ne Dwond Bura oromo kendo tarik 6 Jun, ok ong'ere ka MCAs biro pwodho wachno kata ooyo.
Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party had on April 12written to Nyaribo to nominate lawyer Charles Rigoro as his deputy in what was termed as an understanding between the party and the governor.	Dwond buch Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) nondiko ne Nyariboma tarik 12 April ni mondo oyier loya Charles Rigoro obed jalupne, mano ne en kaka winjruok e kind dwond buch ODM gi gavanano.
“Please communicate the position to all members of the majority party and ensure the party’s interests are secured,” the letter read.	Ne ondik e baruano niya: “Nyisuru jokanyo duto mag majority party parono kendo neuru ni orito dwaro mag dwond bura.”
The assembly is also yet to debate and approve Clive Ogwora, nominee for County Executive for Environment.	Dwond buch ODM bende pok owuoyo kendo pwodho wach keto Clive Ogwora, kaka achiel kuom joma biro laro kom e migawo mar County Executive for Environment.
The delay in considering Ongwora has also become another source of conflict between Nyaribo, Speaker Moffat Teya and some MCAs.	Keto wach Ongwora tenge osebedo achiel kuom gik ma kelo ywaruok e kind Spika ma Nyaribo, Moffat Teya kod MCAs moko.
Teya wrote to Nyaribo on May 13 explaining why he should reconsider his decision to withdraw Ogwora’s name.	Teya nondiko ne Jo-Nyaribo tarik 13 Mei koleronegi gimomiyo onego gipar matut e wach golo nying Ogwora e lisno.
Nyaribo had stated a few months ago that “I have already made up my mind and I have identified another candidate for appointment.”	Dweche moko matin mokalo Nyaribo nowacho niya: “Aseng'ado e chunya kendo yiero ng'at machielo ma biro kedo ne komno.”
Nairobi lawyer and Raila Odinga’s staunch supporter Donald Kipkorir has announced that he will take an extended break from politics.	Okil ma Nairobi kod sapota maduong' mar Raila Odinga ma en Donald Kipkorir oselando ni obiro yueyo momedore ne weche siasa.
In a Twitter post on Monday, May 24, Kipkorir, while making the announcement, challenged Kenyan leaders to love the country above self, family and tribe as a precursor for developing a mature political system.	E wach moro ma noket e Twitter chieng' Wuok Tich tarik 24 Mei, ka ne Kipkorir lando wachno, nonyiso jotelo mag Kenya ni giher piny moloyo kaka giherore giwegi, kaka gihero joodgi kod kaka gihero ogandagi nimar mano en mise maber mar siasa ma kelo dongruok.
“On reflection, I have taken a sabbatical from Kenya’s politics which has no higher ideals, but driven at its default by personal interests with the support of the poor and illiterate bases,” noted Korir.	Korir nondiko niya: “Bang' paro matut, naneno ni ayue matin ne siasa ma Kenya ma pok olokore, ma pod itayo gi gombo mag ng'ato owuon kendo iriwe lwedo gi joma odhier kod joma ok osomo.”
US-based law professor and columnist Makau Mutua, however, cautioned the lawyer against taking the decision, saying it might erode the gains made in trying to sanitise Kenya’s politics.	Kata kamano, profesa mar chike kendo jandiko mar gasede Makau Mutua, nokwero loyano ni kik okaw okang' ma kamano, kowacho ni mano nyalo ketho kinda ma ji e temo timo e loso weche siasa ma Kenya.
He said the lawyer’s decision was like leaving a football pitch in the dying minutes, just when his team was leading.	Nowacho ni paro ma loyano nigo chalo gi jatugo mawuok e paw opira ka sa tugo chiegni rumo ka tim gi e ma ne otelo.
Prof Makau pleaded with Korir not to lose hope in Kenya’s politics saying that things will soon change for the better.	Profesa Makau nosayo Korir ni kik olal geno ma en go e weche siasa ma Kenya kowacho ni machiegnini weche biro dhi maber.
“You are a striker and can’t take a “sabbatical” from the game at the 80th minute with your team leading 2-1. If you do, the other side’s mediocre 11 will beat your 10-man team,” said Prof Mutua.	Profesa Mutua nowacho niya: “In jatugo mogen ahinya omiyo ok inyal “yueyo” to pod odong' dakika matin to tugo ruomo mana nikech jou e nigi gol 2-1. Kitimo kamano,  jotugo ma upiemgo ma yomyom biro loyou.”
Kipkorir maintained that his decision to take a sabbatical was cast on stone, arguing that the political arena was infested with deceitful individuals, and that he was no longer on being part of the confusion.	Kipkorir ne ok oloko paro ma ne en go, kowacho ni siasa pod nopong' gi joma riambo, kendo ni ne ok odhi medo bet e kind joma kamago.
On his part, city lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi challenged the lawyer to disclose the real reason behind his sudden change of heart.	Kowacho pache, Ahmednasir Abdullahi nonyiso loyano ni opand wach maduong' momiyo oloko pache apoya nono.
He alleged that Kipkorir was opting out of politics after realising that the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) and his preferred presidential candidate for the 2022 polls were headed nowhere.	Nowacho ni Kipkorir dwaro weyo weche siasa bang' fwenyo ni Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) kod jal ma gidwaro ni obi oked ne thuolo mar Ker e ombulu ma 2022 onge kama ochomo.
“Have you lost faith in the project? Did you realise the project is doomed? Have you realised that your candidate has zero chance? Is your candidate even running for office? You saw the light,” said Ahmednasir.	Ahmednasir nowacho niya: “Iselalo yie ma ne in go e BBI? Dibed ni nifwenyo ni BBI onge kama odhiye? Dibed ni isefwenyo ni ng'at ma ne udwaro ni okaw kom ker ok bi yudo thuolono? Be ng'atno nigi ofis motele sani? Iseneno ler.”
Kipkorir’s decision to take a break comes as President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila prepare to appeal the High Court ruling that annulled the BBI.	Paro ma Kipkorir ne nigo mar yueyo ne weche siasa nochakore ka Ker Uhuru Kenyatta kod Raila nochako ikore oro kwayo ne Kot Maduong' mondo onon kendo weche BBI.
The President and the ODM leader formed a legal team of six lawyers, led by Attorney General Paul Kihara to try to dismantle the ruling by the High Court judges and allow the BBI reggae to stay on.	Ker kaachiel gi jatend ODM noloso grup mar jong'ad bura auchiel, motelnegi gi Attorney General Paul Kihara mondo oketh wach ma jong'ad bura e Kot Maduong' nong'ado mondo BBI reggae oyud thuolo mar dhi nyime.
In the team to resuscitate the BBI are Solicitor General Kennedy Ogeto, former BBI joint secretary Paul Mwanga, members of the BBI committee of experts Prof Ben Sihanya, Prof Kibe Mungai and city lawyer Jackson Awele.	Grup mar joma ne temo reso BBI ne oriwo Solicitor General Kennedy Ogeto, secretari machon mar BBI Paul Mwanga, jo-komiti mar BBI Profesa Ben Sihanya, Profesa Kibe Mungai kod loya mar taon Jackson Awele.
Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi has stepped up charm offensive of the vote-rich Mt Kenya region.	Jatelo mar Amani National Congress (ANC) Musalia Mudavadi osetiyo gi riekni e sero alwora mar Mt Kenya ma nigi kura mang'eny.
Mudavadi held a series of meetings with leaders, raising speculation over his political game plan in the succession race of President Uhuru Kenyatta.	Mudavadi osetimo romo mang'eny gi jotelo konyisogi chenro ma en go mar kedo ne kom mar Ker bang' Ker ma sani Uhuru Kenyatta.
The ANC leader convened a stakeholders’ meeting with a host of former lawmakers from the region led by Former Members of Parliament Association chairman Humphrey Njuguna (former Gatanga MP) and ex-Gachoka MP Mutava Musyimi, at Sagana Getaway Resort on Friday.	Jatelo mar ANC nobago romo gi jolos chike machon mowuok e alworano kotelnegi gi Huphrey Njuguna (MP machon ma Gatanga) ma sani en jakom mar riwruok miluongo ni Former Members of Parliament Association kod MP machon ma Gachoka ma en Mutava Musyimi. Romono ne otim chieng' Tich Abich e hotel miluongo ni Sagana Getaway Resort.
Mudavadi said his engagements with the leaders revolved around the economic mainstay of the region and programmes that can support the people.	Mudavadi nowacho ni noriwore gi jotelo ma wuok e alworano mondo giwuo e wi gik masiro dongruok mar alworano kod programbe ma moko ma konyo joma wuok e alworano.
He described the region as pivotal for his 2022 presidential bid and was pulling all the strings to reach out to voters.	Nowacho ni ogeno jo alworano ahinya ka luowore gi yiero ma higa 2022 ma doher kedo ne kom mar ker kendo notemo matek mando ochop ir joma biro goyo ombulu.
“Mt Kenya axis is extremely pivotal and critical in Kenya’s political landscape. The population there is huge, they are powerful voters, they come in large numbers when it is time to vote if they believe in the candidacy of the person they want to push through,” said Mudavadi.	"Mudavadi nowacho niya: “Awora mar Mt Kenya omako kama duong' e siasa ma Kenya. Joma odak kuno ng'eny, kendo gin jogo ombulu ma thiring'inyi, giwuokga kar rombgi kodok kor ka goyo ombulu to moloyo ka giyie kuom ng'at ma gidwaro goyone ombuluno."""
“Going into 2022, it is a region that must be taken very seriously, and that is what I am doing as the ANC candidate,” he added in an interview.	Ka ne owuoyo gi jofuambo nomedo kama: “Ka koro wachomo higa mar 2022, alwora mar Mt Kenya en alwora ma nyaka kaw wachne mapek ahinya, kendo mano e gima atimo kaka jal ma dwaro kom ker koa e dwond buch ANC.”
He revealed that he wants to focus on discussions with people to identify their problems before engaging various stakeholders on possible solutions.	Nowacho ni odwaro wuoyo gi ji mondo ong'e gik ma chandogi ka pok owuoyo gi  joma diher siro wechego kaka inyalo tiek chandruogego.
"“Critical issues of Mt Kenya will always revolve first and foremost matters of the economy; they have a lot of entrepreneurship issues, they are very sensitive about their agriculture, coffee, tea, milk,"" noted Mudavadi."	"Mudavadi nowacho niya: “Gik ma chando joma wuok e alwora mar Mt Kenya ibiro ket motelo e weche mag yuto; gin gi gik mang'eny ma chandogi e weche entrepreneurship, ginono ahinya gik momulo weche pur, kahawa, chai, chak."""
"""So when you engage them it is done on the basis that assurance is being given that you will pursue policies and programmes that will be supportive to this economic agenda. These are issues that one has to engage them on and develop approaches together,"" he added."	"Nomedo niya: ""Koro sama iloso kodgi wach nyaka ikonygi bedo gadier ni ibiro luwo chike kod programbe ma biro siro ajenda margi mar weche yuto. Magi gin weche ma ng'ato nyaka wach kodgi kendo kelo paro mag losogi kanyachiel."""
He, however, said that he will prioritise stakeholder engagement rather than working with the perceived regional kingpins.	Kata kamano, nowacho ni obiro keto motelo tudruok gi joma diher siro ajenda mantie kar tiyo gi joma ineno ni e jotelo mag dhoudi ma thurka.
“We have reached a stage where you talk more of stakeholder’s engagement rather than individuals or what you call kingpin-based approach; people now want to know what you are doing for the agricultural sector, transport, policy on taxation among other areas,” he explained.	Nolero niya, “Wasechopo e okang' ma ber wuoyo gi joma nigi gombo mar siro ajenda mantie kar keto pachwa e kit joma wariworego; sani ji gombo neno gima itimo e siro weche weche pur, wuoth, chike mag osuru, kod weche mamoko kaka mago.”
Recently, Mudavadi toured Kieni constituency where he was hosted by area MP Kanini Kega.	Machiegnini Mudavadi nolimo constituency ma Kieni kama ne orwake gi MP ma kuno Kanini Kega.
He has lined up a series of political engagements in the coming days to solidify support.	Osechano limbe mang'eny mag timo winjruok mag siasa e odiechienge mabiro mondo mondo omedgo kwan mar joma riwe lwedo.
The ANC leader noted that there was a growing impatience amongst the youth due to unemployment and prohibitive tax regimes that have frustrated their efforts to do business or get jobs.	Jatend ANC nofwenyo ni rowere nigi achiedh nade mang'eny nikech onge mar tich kendo nikech sirkande  mosebedo e telo osebedo ka kawo osuru mang'eny aduwa to mano osemono ojende timo ohala kata nwang'o tich.
"“We do not know what they are thinking of and what they will eventually do when they get angry at us. They have become rebellious and we need to seek solutions amongst us leaders. This younger generation is not a happy lot,"" said Mudavadi."	"Mudavadi nowacho ni, “Wakia gik ma giparo kod gik ma gichano timo ka koro gijok ma igi owang' kodwa. Gisebedo ka ging'anyo kendo dwarore ni wamany yore ma wanyalo konyogigo kaka jotelo. Tieng' ma sani mar rowere ok mor kata matin."""
Mr Kega described Mudavadi as a friend to Nyeri people saying that the Mt Kenya region was open to negotiation with everybody.	Mr. Kega nowacho ni Mudavadi en osiep Jo-Nyeri kendo ni jo Mt Kenya ni thuolo loso winjruok gi ng'ato ang'ata.
He said the voters will back the presidential candidate with the best offer for the region.	Nowacho ni jogo ombulu biro riwo lwedo ng'at ma kedo ne kom Ker ma nigi gima ber mogik mosingo ne jo alworano.
“We are very accommodative people; we want as many bridegrooms before we can settle on one that will take good care of our people,” said Kega.	Kega nowach ni, “Warwako ji juto, wadwaro chwo mang'eny kaka nyalore ka pok wayiero riwo arus gi ng'ato achiel ma biro rito jowa e yo maber.”
“We are open for negotiation with everybody, unlike the Tangatanga who have already committed themselves to Ruto. Mudavadi has been our friend, but the point is that we are open for anybody with the best offer for our people,” added the MP.	MP-no nomedo wacho niya: “Waikore wuoyo gi ji duto mopogore gi Jo-Tangatanga ma oseketo pachgi kuom Ruto.

Njuguna said talks with the ANC leader revolved around the way forward for the region and the country.	Njuguna nowacho ni wuoyo margi gi jatend ANC notenore ahinya hinya e wach kaka inyalo kony alworano kod Kenya mangima.
He noted that the region was open to negotiations with politicians seeking the presidency.	Nowacho ni giikore loso wach gi jasiasa moro amora ma kedo ne kom mar Ker.
“Mudavadi has asked for our support and we shall continue with this conversation because we think Mudavadi is a leader worth engaging. And as a region we think we should consider him among other leaders because we believe Mt Kenya is going to play a major role in the 2022 succession politics,” he said.	Nowacho niya: “Mudavadi osekwayowa ni wasire kendo wabiro dhi nyime gi mbakani nikech waparo ni Mudavadi en jatelo mowinjore losogo wach.

"“We have followed your story and your convictions, the things you have done in government and even as a profession in the lands sector, and we feel very proud to be associated with you,"" said the lawmakers."

Former Ndia MP Stephen Ngare said that leaders seeking the support of the region have to spell out their agenda for the coffee industry.	Stephen Ngare ma chon ne en MP ma Ndia nowacho ni jotelo ma manyo kony e alworagomo onego owach ajenda ma gin-go ne kambi mar kahawa.
He said the sector was completely down with value addition, adding that farmers feel the government has let them down.	Nowacho ni kambino nopodho nikwop wach value addition,kendo medo ni jopur neno ni sirkal e ma omiyo mano otimore.

ODM leader Raila Odinga is in Kisumu County today (Monday) as he seeks to put his house in order ahead of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s visit to the region in a week’s time.

The move is part of the efforts he has put in place to ensure that the President does not walk into a hostile crowd following claims of betrayal over the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) process that has run into a brick wall.

The Standard has established that the ODM chief is hoping to calm the sense of disquiet in his ODM party and backyard over the stalled BBI process.

The ODM chief will meet ODM leaders from the region in a meeting that is meant to resolve some of the woes that have rocked the Orange party in the recent past.

Although the agenda of the meeting has been kept a closely-guarded secret, sources told The Standard that unity of the party, preparations for Madaraka Day celebrations and the 2022 succession quest, tops the list of issues the ODM chief wants to discuss.	Kata obedo ni weche ma ibiro wuoye e romono pok oket e lela, moko kuom joma nolosogi nonyiso The Standard ni wach riwo jokanyo mag ODM, ikruok ne nyasi mar Madaraka, kod ombulu ma 2022, e moko kuom weche madongo ma ni e list ma jatend ODM biro wuoye.
But it is the crack in the ODM party that risks publicly embarrassing the ODM chief should local politics and supremacy battles within his own party play out during the national celebrations.

BBI Secretariat co-chairmen Junet Mohamed and Dennis Waweru described the ruling as more focused on the taskforce and deliberately ignored the BBI Secretariat as the promoters of the Bill.	Junet Mohamed kod Dennis Waweru ma gin jokom mag BBI nowacho ni bura ma nong'adno ne ng'iyo mana jotelo mag BBI to oweyo goyiem neno joma nie komiti mar BBI kaka joma bende siro Chik milosono.
"""The judges stopped the President who is not a promoter of the BBI Bill. We assure Kenyans that we shall continue to promote the constitutional amendment Bill until it is ratified by Kenyans,"" said Junet."	"Junet nowacho kama, ""Jong'ad bura nokwero ker ma ok en kata ng'at ma dwaro ni oket BBI e katiba. Dwahero nyiso Jo-Kenya ni wabiro dhi nyime lando ote mar siro BBI nyaka chieng' Jo-Kenya pwodhe mondo okete e katiba."""
Yesterday, the secretariat released a list of stakeholders, meetings and number of written submissions that cumulatively helped build the BBI Bill that the courts declared unconstitutional.	Jotelo mag BBI nyoro ne ogolo list ma oting'o nyinge ji duto ma siro BBI, romo duto ma gisebedego kod kwan mar weche mopogore opogore mondik ma duto koriw kanyachiel to loso weche manie BBI ma doho nong'ado ni ok owinjore gi katiba.
They explained that before the Bill came into being, the 14 member BBI Taskforce led by the late Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji engaged deeply and widely including meeting over 400 elected leaders, present and past, prominent local voices from the community and youth and and the 755 handwritten submissions during public forums in the counties	Ne gilero ni ka ne pok olos BBI kendo dwaro mondo opwodhe obed e Chik, ji 14 ma ne oyier mondo olos BBI kotelnegi gi seneta mosenindo mar Garisa miluongo ni Yusuf Haji, ne oromo kendo wuoyo ahinya gi jotelo mokalo 400 mantie sani kod mane nitie chon, ne giwuoyo bende gi jotelo ma nigi huma e gwenge kendo ne giyudo weche mondik mopogore opogore maromo 755 koa kuom raia e romo mane gitimo gi oganda e lela.
They said the Haji-led taskforce received presentations from 123 individuals representing major institutions, including constitutional bodies and major stakeholders in the civil and private sector spaces and 261 individuals and organisations who emailed memoranda.	Ne giwacho ni jotelo mane omi tij loso BBI kotelnegi gi Haji ne oyudo ripode mowuok kuom ji 123 ma ne ochung'ne riwruoge moko madongo, moriwo riwruoge molos gi chik kod joma nigi migepe madongo e ofise sirkal kod mag oganda. Bende ne nitie ji 261 kod riwruoge moko mane ooro ripot mekgi e wi wachno.
"""Due care was taken to ensure that the face of Kenya was captured in this process: The Taskforce consulted more than 7,000 citizens from all ethnic groups, genders, cultural and religious practices and different social and economic sectors,"" read their statement."	"Ne giwacho kama e ripodgi, ""Chenro mar loso BBI ne otemo matek ahinya mondo gine pach ji duto e piny Kenya owinj.

The BBI secretariat said details of all individuals and groups that participated either in person or through written memoranda are at pages 134 to 154 of the taskforce report.	Jotelo mag BBI ne owacho ni weche e wi ji duto kod grube mane okonyo e chiwo pachgi aching' kata kokalo kuom weche mondik yudore e ite mar 134 nyaka 154 e ripot ma ne ochiw gi jogo mane oyier mondo olos BBI.
And to prove further wide consultation, the team said the BBI Steering committee was subsequently appointed to validate the report of the taskforce and once again met Kenyans from all walks of life and those who contributed were captured in pages 161 to 173 of the Steering Committee’s Report.	Kae to mondo ginyis ni kuom adier ne giwinjo pach ji mang'eny, ne giwacho ni ne olos Komiti mar BBI mondo onon ripot ma ne ochiw gi joma ne oyier mondo olos BBI, to komitino bende ne ochako oromo gi Jo-Kenya mopogore opogore mondo ochiw pachgi to jok ma ne giwuoyogo ondik nyingegi e ite mar 161 nyaka 173 e Ripod Komiti mar BBI.
"""The validation exercise was conducted through the following content and report implementation, national Stakeholder Validation Fora. The Steering Committee held a total of 93 stakeholder consultation meetings at the KICC, Laico Regency hotel and at its offices in Nairobi,"" the statement added."	"Ne gimedo wacho kama, ""Nonro mane otim mondo opwodh ripot notim kokalo kuom romo mitimo gi ji e galamoro miluongo ni Stakeholder Validation Fora.

The foras, they explained, were attended by representatives from civil society, faith-based organisations, women’s groups, youth groups, persons with disability (PWD) groups, cultural leaders and Government and regional meetings took place across the country to discuss and validate the taskforce report.	Ne gilero ni joma ne biro e romogo ne oriwo joma tiyo e ofise sirkal, riwruoge mag din, grube mag joma mine, grube mag rowere, grube mochung'ne joma ong'ol, jotend gweng' kod Sirkal kendo romo mane gitimogo ne gibedego kuonde mopogore opogore e piny mondo giwuo kendo gipwodh ripot mane ondik gi joma ne oyier mondo olos BBI.
On Friday, Junet said they respect the High Court's decision, but they do not agree with it and they will explore all options to ensure people-driven review of the 2010 Constitution.	Junet nowcho chieng' Tich Abich ni gimiyo luor bura ma ne doho mamalo ong'ado, kata kamano, ok giyie gi burano kendo gibiro dhi nyime manyo yore duto manyalo konyo e neno ji onono kendo weche manie Katiba ma ne olos 2010.
"""As law abiding leaders, we respect the decision of the court. But we don’t agree with it. Consequently, we are setting up a legal team to look into and appeal the ruling. We assure all Kenyans who believe in the BBI and it’s promise, not to give up. It’s is not over yet. We will fight to the bitter end for that dream to be realised,"" said Junet."	"Junet nowacho kama, ""Wan jotelo maluwo gima chik wacho kendo wamiyo luor bura ma doho nong'ado. Kata kamano, ok wayie ni nong'ad burano e yo makare.

Waweru said the BBI process was people driven and Kenyans are will to change the Constitution to improve governance and take more resources to the grassroots.	Waweru nowacho ni chenro ma ne otigo e loso BBI ne oriwo jopiny kendo Jo-Kenya gombo loko Katiba mondo gibed gi joloch mabeyo kendo mwandu mag piny oyudre ne ji mayot e gweng'.
"""The proposed additional 70 constituencies will ensure more money is taken to the grassroots and improve the economic situation across the country.

ODM party leader Raila Odinga (pictured) may have disliked the court’s outcome on the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) judgement, but still intends to appeal the decision.	Jatend duond bura mar ODM, Raila Odinga (en e picha) ne ok omor gi bura mane doho ong'ado e wi BBI, kata kamano ochano mar kwayo mondo owinj burano kendo.
In a party statement on Saturday, Raila avowed: “We will calmly and respectfully move to the Court of Appeal to present our case as to why we think the High Court did not render the right verdict. We will do so with sobriety and with respect for our judges and courts.”	"Kane owuoyo e lo duond bura mar ODM, Raila nowacho niya, ""Wadwaro kwayo apil gi muolo mondo owinj kes marwa kendo nikech waneno ni doho mamalo ne ok ong'adonwa bura makare. Wabiro timo kamano ka wachiwo luor matut ne jong'ad bura mekwa kod doho."""
His sentiments breaking a two-day long silence on High Court’s ruling declaring the BBI process as unlawful, null, and void.	Raila nowacho wechego bang' bedo moling' kuom odiechienge ariyo chakre ne doho mamalo ng'ado ni yo ma ne otigo e loso BBI ne ok owinjore gi chik kendo ok ginyal tiyo.
The former Premier however called for restraint from personalised attacks on the court and its members, especially the five judge-bench that delivered the Thursday ruling.	Raila bende nokwayo ji mondo kik gimonj doho kod joma tiyo kuno, ahinya ahinya jong'ad bura abich ma nong'ado bura e wi BBI chieng' Tich Ang'wen.
He stated: “We may disagree with the court but we must respect its ruling and its freedom to exercise its judgment as it understands the legal and constitutional matters before it.”	"Nowacho kama, ""Nyalo bedo bura ma doho ong'ado ok morwa, kata kamano, nyaka wamiye luor nikech doho temo matek mondo ong'ad bura kaluwore gi chik kod weche motenore kuom chik mokelne mondo onon."""
Raila's team will be heading to the Appellate Court to seek a second opinion, in hopes that it shall revive ‘Reggae’.	Raila gi lange biro dhi e doho mar apil mondo owinj kes margi kendo ka gigeno ni mano biro chiero 'Reggae'
Other BBI proponents including BBI Secretariat co-chair Junet Mohammed also vowed to appeal the decision.	Jomamoko moriwo nyaka jakom mar bura matayo BBI, Junet Mohammed bende osingore ni gibiro ng'ado apil mondo owinj kesno kendo.
"In a televised address yesterday, Junet is quoted as saying: ""We respect the decision of the court but we don't agree with it. It is not over yet; We will fight to the bitter end until a new Kenya is realised.”"	"Nyoro ka ne Junet wuoyo e tv ne owacho kama, ""Wachiwo luor ne bura ma ne doho ong'ado, kata kamano ok wayie gi burano. Ma ok e giko, wabiro dhi nyime kedo nyaka walos Kenya manyien."""
Top legal minds including Bobby Mkangi, Charles Kanjama, Steve Ogolla and Elias Mutuma, however, believe the petitioners would have a low chance of success, while another section led by Prof. Ben Sihanya and Tom Joseph Kajwang, believe the lower court’s ruling would be overturned at the Appellate court.

Raila, an avid promoter of the BBI has in the past expressed that it must be subjected to a referendum.	Raila ma osebedo ka jiwo ahinya wach BBI osewacho e kinde mokalo ni ji onego ogo kura ne BBI e referendum.
“We agreed that the BBI must be subjected to a referendum because it entails a fundamental reorganization of the architecture of the Executive and Kenyans need to have a say in the reorganization,” he said in March.	"Raila nowacho kama e dwe mar Mach, ""Ne wawinjore ni oter BBI e referendum nikech oting'o lokruoge madongo e wi chenro mar loch omiyo Jo-Kenya nyaka chiw pachgi e yor ombulu ka be gidwaro lokruogego."""
Victim or villain? Wajir governor's long journey in corridors of justice	Nokethne koso en e Jaketho? Kes moyware mar Gavana ma Wajir
Wajir Governor Mohamud Abdi (left) and his Lawyer Paul Nyamodi during the impeachment debate at Senate chambers, bunge buildings, Nairobi.	Gavana ma Wajir miluongo ni Mohamud Abud (koracham) kod okil mare ma nyinge Paul Nyamondi ka gin e Senate mantie e bunge Nairobi sama niyalo dwaro ma ji nigo ni mondo ogole oko e loch.
The Senate select committee hearing impeachment proceedings against Wajir Governor Abdi Mohamud declined to summon family members after Members of the County Assembly accused them of graft.	Komiti mar Senate ma ne oyier mondo owinj kes mar golo e loch Gavana ma Wajir, Abdi Mohamud, notamore luongo joode bang' ka jood bura e kaonti ma Wajir wacho ni joode noriwore kode kwalo pesa.
Nyamira Senator Okong’o Omogeni-led team had been told by the MCAs through lawyer Ahmednasir Mohamed that the wife and children had some serious explaining to do about skewed payments made by the county government, which the county assembly believes were kickbacks running into millions of shillings.	Seneta ma Nyamira, Okong'o Omogeni ma ne otelone komitino ne onyis gi MCA moko kokalo kuom okil Ahmednasir Mohamed ni chi gavana kaachiel gi nyithinde ne onego ler tiend pesa moko madongo ma sirkand kaonti ne chulogi, pesa ma wachore ni nyalo bedo milionde modhuro.
So weighty are the MCAs' accusations against the Mohamud family that they claimed the county first lady was akin to the “Supreme Leader,” upon whose discretion lay the survival of senior technocrats in the county government.	"Weche ma MCA-go odonjonego jood Mohamud gin weche mapek ahinya nikech giwacho chi gavana ne ng'ama chiegni ahinya gi ""Jatelo Maduong' Mogik"" ma ne tayo joma nigi migepe madongo ahinya e sirkand kaonti."
"“It is an open secret in Wajir County and far beyond that Mrs Kheira Omar is the supreme leader and it's always her way or the highway,"" Elnur-Tulatula MCA Abdullahi Issack told the Senate."	"MCA ma Elnur- Tulatula, Abdullahi Issack nonyiso Senate ni, ""Ok en gima opondo e kaonti mar Wajir kod alworane ni Mrs Kheira Omar en jatelo maduong' ma ka ok itimo kaka odwaro to onyalo riembi e tiji."""
For Mohamud though, it is not just his integrity and career on the line – his family has been dragged into the murky world of politics – with his wife Kheria Omar, son Yusuf Mohammed Abdi and Daughter Ferhiya Mohammed key persons of interest.	Kes momako Mohamud ok dhi ketho mana nyinge kod tije kende, kar mano, joode bende wachni okwako nikech chiege miluongo ni Kheria Omar, wuode Yusuf Mohammed Abdi kod nyare ma nyinge Ferhiya Mohammed bende inono.
As a reprieve, in its ruling on Wednesday, the House team declined to summon the family members but ordered that a fourth witness – businessman Osman Jibale – appear before the committee to shed more light on suspect payments to several of his companies and remittances allegedly made to the Mohamud family.	E bura ma ne ging'ado Tich Adek, komiti mar Senate ne oweyo ma ok giluongo jood Mohamud to kar mano ne giwacho ni gidwaro janeno mar ang'wen ma ne jalok ohala miluongo ni Osman Jibale. Ne onego obi e nyim komiti mondo mondo oler ane pesa ma kembege ne chulo jood Mohamud.
Jibale was, however, no show on Thursday, and was also unreachable on phone, when the assembly legal team attempted to call him.	Kata kamano, Jibale ne ok obiro chieng' Tich Ang'wen to bende ne ok oyudre e simo kane otem manye.
Jibale, the MCAs claim is a distant nephew of the first lady – adding to governor Mohamud’s tribulations – as the 11-member team retreated to draft a report this weekend ahead of a likely tabling before the House tomorrow (Sunday).	Jood bura mar county assembly wacho ni Jibale en wat chi gavana, to mano medo ketho weche ne Mohamud sama grup moting'o ji 11 nowuok mondo gindik ripot ka pok gichiwe ne Senate kiny chieng' Jumapil.
Mohamud was impeached in a vote backed by 37 MCAs against 10. 	Ne ogol Mohamud e loch gi kura mag MCA 37 ka apar kende ema ne oriwe lwedo.
Among the charges facing the governor is a gross violation of the Constitution, corruption, abuse of office, poor service and gross misconduct.

Ji apar gachiel manie komiti mar Senate oriwo Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi), Mwangi Githiomi (Nyandarua), Susan Kihika (Nakuru), Godana Hargura (Marsabit) kod Okong’o Omogeni (Nyamira).

Jomamoko gin Mithika Linturi (Meru), Fred Outa (Kisumu), Agnes Muthama (Machakos), Issa Juma (Kwale) kod  seneta mogwel gi duond bura Petronilla Were kod Christine Zawadi.
Mohamud has been in and out of court for the last three years having had his election challenged all the way to the Doho Maduong' Mogik.	Osebed kiyalo Mohamud kuom higni adek mokalo chakre ne donjne e doho mamalo mogik (Doho Maduong' Mogik) ni ne ok oyombo maber e ombulu.
The tumultuous start of Mohamud’s tenure as governor, would ironically, however, come to define his slightly over three years in power – fighting at the courts, and in the county assembly to remain in power – the climax of which is his current impeachment battle at the Senate.	Mohamud ne ochak tije kaka gavana gi pek mang'eny to kuom higni adek ma osebedego e loch osebedo kodich kiyale e doho, okedo e county assembly mondo odong' e loch to gikone okedo e Senate mondo kik thiche oko e loch.
When Justice Fred Mabeya quashed his election on January 12, 2018, there was a mix of celebration and uproar loaded in the clan and political undertones.	Ka ne Jang'ad Bura Moluor Fred Mabeya ong'ado ni ok oyombo e yo mowinjore tarik 12 Januar, 2018 ji mang'eny ne omor gi wachno to jomoko be igi nowang'.
At the time, immediate former Governor Ahmed Abdulahi had petitioned the election on among other grounds electoral malpractice and Mohamud’s then alleged lack of a university degree, a requirement for all gubernatorial aspirants.	E kindeno, gavana ma nitie chon Ahmed Abdulahi ne odhi e doho kotamore ni Mohamud noyombe mana nikech nokwalo kura kod weche mamoko kae to e kindeno ne wachore ni Mohamud onge digri moro amora mar yunivasiti, to mano en gima dwarore kuom ji duto ma dwaro bedo gavana.
The Court of Appeal subsequently affirmed the nullification but at the Doho Maduong' Mogik, Mohamud recouped his seat.	Doho mar Apil ne owacho ni Mohamud ok oyombo e yo mowinjore kata kamano, Doho Maduong' Mogik bang'e noduogo omiyo Mohamud loch.
Curiously – like classic echoes from the past, lawyer Ahmednassir Abdulahi was the same man that tormented his legal team up to the Doho Maduong' Mogik, while representing the former governor.	Gimiwuoro en ni Ahmednassir Abdullahi e ng'at achiel achiel ma ne otelone tero wach e Doho Maduong' Mogik ndalocha e lo gavana machon.
This week, Governor Mohamud told the Senate team: “I believe this impeachment is politically motivated with malice and witch-hunt.”  	"Gavana Mohamud nowachone Senate kama jumani: ""An gadier ni jogo madwaro gola oko e loch gin josiasa ma dwaro mana ketho nyinga to onge gima rach ma asetimo."""
Among critical defense witnesses, the governor called to the stand, was Wajir county acting secretary Abdulahi Hassan Maalim, who also accused the assembly of a political witch-hunts.	Achiel kuom joneno ma gavana ne oluongo mondo okonye ne en jagoro ma kaonti mar Wajir Abdulahi Hassan Maalim ma bende nowacho ni jood bura ma kaonti ohero ketho nyinge josiasa.
Maalim told the Senate team that Mohamud had worked extremely hard to improve service delivery in the county and denied claims of vacating his decision-making powers to his wife.	Maalim ne onyiso jood bura mar Senate ni Mohamud notiyo matek ahinya mondo gik moko otimre maber e kaonti kendo nokwedo gima ji wacho ni gavana nomiyo chiego teko mar timo yiero madongo.
“I am not aware of the first lady being a member of the Executive Committee chairing any meetings. From 2018 to date, there is nowhere we have met the first faddy to discuss substantive matters of the county,” Maalim said.	"Maalim nowacho niya, ""Ok apar ka nitie romo moro amora mosega ta gi chi gavana kata ka be en jakanyo mar Komiti Matayo.

The absence of a law to guide the referendum process was among the many issues that sank the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill 2020 on Thursday.	Nikech onge chik matayo kaka inyalo tim referendum, mano en achiel kuom gik momiyo ne ok opwodh Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill ma 2020 chieng' Tich Ang'wen.
In their ruling, the five High Court judges found that the Bill birthed by the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) was launched when there was no legislation governing the process leading to and the conduct of a referendum.	Jong'ad bura abich mag doho mamalo nofwenyo ni lokruok midwaro ni otim ne chikno en gima Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) ema okelo kendo onge chik moro amora matayo kaka onego otim referendum.
“A declaration is issued that in the absence of the legislation or legal framework to govern the collection, presentation and verification of signatures and conduct of a referendum in the circumstances of this case renders the attempt to amend the Constitution of Kenya through the amendment Bill 2020 flawed,” presiding judge Joel Ngugi read the court’s decision.	"Jang'ad bura matayo Joel Ngugi nosomo bura ma ne ging'ado mawacho ni: ""Oseng'ad wach ni ka onge chik matayo kaka ibiro chok sei, chiwogi kendo nono sei-go sama itimo referendum mana kaka e kes ma wan-go sani, mano miyo gik mitimo mondo olok Katiba kata Chik mar Kenya kokalo kuom amendment Bill ma 2020 obed ma otim e yo ma ok kare."""
The judges noted that bunge had acknowledged the apparent vacuum and had moved to propose the required legislation to address the gaps.	Jong'ad bura nofwenyo ni bunge ong'eyo ni nitie gik maonge e chik kendo ne gisechako luwo chenro ma ne dhi miyo gik maonge e chikgo obed mantie.
This was in reference to the separate versions of a Referendum Bill sponsored by two National Assembly Committees	Mano en kaluwore gi Referendum Bill ariyo mopogore ma ne ochiw gi Komiti mag National Assembly.
The Constitutional Implementation Oversight Committee (CIOC), which is chaired by Ndaragwa MP Jeremiah Kioni, fronted the Referendum Bill, 2020 in June last year.	Komiti miluongo ni Constitutional Implementation Oversight Committee (CIOC) ma jakom mare en MP ma Ndaragwa, Jeremiah Kioni, ema ne okwongo pedho Referendum Bill ma 2020 e dwe mar Jun higa mokalo
The Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC), currently chaired by Kangema MP Muturi Kigano, has its version – the Referendum (No. 2) Bill, 2020 – which was tabled in bunge by Baringo North MP William Cheptumo.	Komiti machielo miluongo ni Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) ma jakom mare en MP ma Kangema, Muturi Kigano bende nigi margi miluongo ni Referendum (No. 2) Bill ma 2020 ma ne opedh e nyim bunge gi Jaod Bura ma Baringo North William Cheptumo.
At the moment, the JLAC version, which was tabled first, is at the committee stage, with CIOC Bill still at the First Reading stage.	Gie sani, Bill mar JLAC osechopo e kidieny ma inone gi komiti nikech en ema nokwongo to Bill mar CIOC eka nie kidieny michakogo ma e some mokwongo.
The National Assembly speaker Justin Muturi ruled that the JLAC proposal be given priority after the CIOC and JLAC failed to develop a consolidated Bill as advised by the speaker.	Spika mar National Assembly, Justin Muturi,  nong'ado ni Bill mar JLAC ema okwong ochakgo nikech CIOC kod JLAC ne ok oriwo Bill margi kanyachiel kaka spika nonyisogi ni gitim.
In his ruling issued in February this year, Muturi found that the JLAC proposal had resulted from a consultative process between the committee and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) dating back to 2015.	E bura ma nong'ado Februar higani, Muturi nofwenyo ni kwayo mar JLAC ne obetie nikech komitino ne obet piny ma gigudo paro gi IEBC (Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission) e higa mar 2015.
“Should the Bill sponsored by JLAC be withdrawn by the mover or get lost at any stage, the House will result to considering the Bill sponsored by the CIOC in the published form. This would be a last resort,” ruled Muturi.	"Muturi nowacho kama, ""Po nono ni Bill mar JLAC ogol gi ng'ama nokele kata olal e ma ok osudo e kidieny moro, mano biro chunowa ni wanon Bill mar CIOC kaka osegoye e otas. Mano biro timore mana ka onge yo machielo."""
As the dust settles on Thursday's ruling, Kioni faults the courts and bunge, to some extent, for the current state of affairs.	Kioni neno doho kod bunge ema onego osiem kaluwore gi kaka ji biro kaka yiero ma ne otim Tich Ang'wen.
Kioni believes that bunge dragged its feet in enacting a referendum law.	Kioni neno ni bunge nodeko goyiem e pwodho chik mar referendum.
"“We should have processed this Bill much earlier. As a committee, we thought of a framework as the BBI Bill was processed. The House Business Committee should explain why it did not prioritise our Bill earlier,"" Kioni said."	"Kioni nowacho kama, ""Nonego bed ni wacho nono Bill-no chon ahinya. Kaka komiti nitie paro mane wabedego sama waloso BBI Bill. Komiti miluongo ni House Business Committee onego oleronwa gimomiyo ne gichako nono Bill marwa chon."""
He, however, said Thursday’s court ruling disregarded to the prevailing realities.	Nowacho bende ni gima doho nong'ado Tich Ang'wen ne ok odewo chal ma nitiere sani.
“The Constitution lists the necessary principles for conducting a referendum and it is the nitty-gritty that needs to be tidied up,” he said, terming the BBI process as one that captured the imagination of Kenyans.	"Kioni medo wacho ni, ""Chik oting'o weche madwarore e tayo kaka onego otimo referendum en mana ni nitie weche moko madondore matindo tindo ma onego onon."" Nowacho ni yo ma ne olosgo BBI ne en kaluwore gi gombo mag Jo-Kenya."
"""Kenyans must know that they have the sovereign right to say how they want things to be done. The judges should have cautioned the applicants for going to court too late. You cannot sit on your rights.” "	"""Jo-Kenya onego ong'e ni gin gi ratiro mar wacho kaka gidwaro ni gik moko otimre. Jong'ad bura ne onego osiem ji ka pok gidhi e kot molewo. Ok nyal bet abeta ka iketho ratiro ma un-go."""
Both the JLAC and CIOC Bills prescribe the process of conducting a referendum, even as the CIOC proposal restricted itself to amendments resulting from a popular initiative.	Bill mag JLAC kod CIOC duto lero chenro monego luw kitimo referendum kata obedo CIOC to nodich mana gi weche monego olok e chik kaluwore gi dwaro mag ji mang'eny.
As stipulated in the Constitution, both Bills state that a popular initiative shall be backed by at least a million registered voters.	Mana kaka Chik be wacho, Bill ariyogo duto bende wacho lokruok midwaro gi ji mang'eny onego obed ji ma ogone ombulu ma ok tinne milion achiel.
As ruled on Thursday, IEBC will be required to verify the signatures through a proper framework.	Mana kaka nowach Tich Ang'wen, IEBC biro nono sei ma ne ochok ka gitiyo gi yo mowinjore.
The JLAC Bill further proposes that not more than a third of those who sign up shall be from one county.	Bill mar JLAC dhi nyime wacho ni e wi kwan mag sei duto mochok, ok onego oyudre ni kaonti achiel ogolo sei mokalo achiel e wi adek mag seigo.
Proposed amendment	Lokruok Midwaro Ket e Chik
“Voters in at least 24 counties shall be represented,” reads the JLAC referendum Bill in part, which also makes it mandatory to publish the names and signatures of those who support a draft Bill.	"Referendum Bill mar JLAC wacho ni ""Jogo ombulu biro wuok e kaonti ma ok tinne 24."" To mano nyiso ni biro chuno ni nyaka ndik nyinge kod sei mag ji duto ma siro Bill mikelono."
Both Bills had seemingly foreseen the likelihood of a multi-choice referendum.	Bill-go duto nenore ni nowacho ni e referendum ne idhi mi ji thuolo mar timo yiero mopogore opogore.
“Each question to be determined during a referendum shall require the voter to select an answer that is either “yes” or “no”,” reads the Kioni Bill	"Bill ma ne Kioni osomo ne wacho kama: ""Penjo duto ma ibiro penj sa referendum biro dwaro ni oyier dwoko ma wacho ni ""Ee"" kata ""Ooyo""."""
The JLAC Bill, however, falls short of the judges’ verdict that each proposed amendment would be a separate question as it only allows that a proposed initiative may be challenged by another in the form of separate draft Bills.   	Bill mar JLAC ok chop e rang'iny ma jong'ad bura ne dwaro ka ne giwacho ni moro ka moro kuom lokruok midwaro ni otim e chik onego onego oket kaka penjo mopog tenge gi penjo mamoko to mano ne dhi miyo bedo mayot pimo bill-no gi bill mamoko ma bende idwaro los e chik.
High Court ruling on BBI sets stage for challenging key government decisions	Bura ma ne doho mamalo ong'ado e wi BBI dhi bedo chakruok mar nono yiero moko madongo ma sirkal timo.
Justices Teresia Matheka, George Odunga, Joel Ngugi, Jairus Ngaah and Chacha Mwita at a Court in Milimani on Thursday, May 13, 2021, delivering the judgement on eight consolidated petitions challenging the BBI Referendum.	Jong'ad bura Teresia Matheka, George Odunga, Joel Ngugi, Jairus Ngaah kod Chacha Mwita ka gin e doho ma Milimani chieng' Tich Ang'wen tarik 13 Mei, 2021 sama ne ging'ado bura e wi kwayo aboro mopogore moriw mag joma ne kwedo wach timo referendum ne BBI.
The landmark decision by the High Court to scuttle the Building Bridges Initiative has drawn sharp reactions from constitutional lawyers over its implication to the country.	Bura makende ma ne ong'ad gi Doho Mamalo ma ne ok osiro BBI ochwanyo okinde mang'eny maneno ni burano ok bero weche maber kuom jopiny.
Whereas some lawyers celebrated the decision as a bold statement by the Judiciary to stop an illegal process, other legal experts argued that the decision was illegal as the judges themselves violated the Constitution by failing to correctly apply the law in determining the issues raised.	Kata obedo ni okinde moko to mor ahinya ni doho nobedo gi chir ma chungo gima ketho chik, jomoko ma bende olony e weche chik to neno ni bura ma ne ong'adno ne ok owinjore gi chik nikech jong'ad burago giwegi ne giketho chik ka ne ok gilwuwo chik e yo mowinjore sama ne ging'ado bura.
According to lawyer Duncan Okatch, the judges opened a Pandora’s Box where we are likely to see several cases of people challenging some decisions that has been taken by President Uhuru Kenyatta and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).	Kaluwore gi okil Duncan Okatch, gima jong'ad bura notimo chalo gi yawo box mar Pandora, tiende ni ji mang'eny koro biro dhi doho ka gidonjone gik ker Uhuru Kenyatta osetimon kaachiel kod IEBC.
“The judges seemed to have even gone against decisions of other judges from the same court on interpretation of the Constitution on some of the issues raised. The implication is that we are likely to see several litigations against actions that have been taken by some institutions,” said Okatch.	"Okatch nowacho kama, ""Nenore ni bura ma ne jong'ad bura ong'ado opogore gi buche moko ma gisega ng'ado e doho achiel achielno e wi kaka ilero Chik e kes moko mane giyalo. Gima mano dhi kelo en samoro koro kwan mag kes dhi medore mag joma donjo ne jomoko e wi gik mane gitimo chon."""
From their final orders, which contained 23 declarations, legal experts said Justices Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Chacha Mwita and Teresia Matheka judgements could be summarised into four broad sections which have far reaching consequences.	"E wechegi mogik moting'o buche 23 ma ne ging'ado, joma olony e chik wacho ni bura ma ne ochiw gi jong'ad bura Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Chacha Mwita kod Teresia Matheka inyalo pog e grube ang'wen madongo ma moro ka moro nyalo nyuolo weche madongo bang'e."""
Top on the list was the declaration that President Kenyatta violated the Constitution and that he has no powers to initiate changes to the Constitution.	Wach mokwongo e list ma ne gindikono en ni Ker Uhuru Kenyatta noketho Chik kendo ni oonge gi teko mar timo lokruoge e chik.
The judges also ruled that civil court proceedings can be instituted against the president or a person performing the functions of the Office of President during their tenure of office and that the steering Committee on the Implementation of the Building Bridges to a United Kenya Taskforce Report established by the president is an unconstitutional and unlawful entity.	Jong'ad bura bende nowacho ni ng'ato ang'ato nyalo donjo ne ker e doho gi ketho motimo kata mar ng'at matiyo tij ker e kinde ma ker pod nie loch, kendo Komiti mar BBI mane ker owuon ema oloso mondo ochiw ripot mar nonro margi e gima nyalo riwo Jo-Kenya, en komiti ma owinjore gi chik.
Law Society of Kenya (LSK) President Nelson Havi says that the judgment is an indictment on President Kenyatta. He was of the view that the breach of the Constitution is a serious matter that he can be personally held accountable for.	Ker mar Law Society of Kenya (LSK) ma nyinge Nelson Havi nowacho ni bura ma ne ong'adno ne oketho nying Ker Uhuru Kenyatta. Havi wacho ni ketho Chik en gima duong' ahinya ma ng'ato otimo to ok onego oweye aweya.
According to him, the judge’s reference to the president as a Mr Uhuru amounts to stripping him of his status as a Head of State.	En oneno ni kane jong'ad bura oluongo ker ni Mr Uhuru, mano ne chalo ka gima gimaye duong' ma en go kaka Ker mar piny.
“There is no decision of the High Court that is clear on the misconduct of the president as this one. If it were in Israel or India, he would have resigned. You realised they have referred to him as a Mr Kenyatta; they have stripped him of the stature of a president,” said Havi.	"Havi nowacho niya, ""Mae kende e bura ma doho mamalo oseng'ado manyiso ayanga ni ker notimo ketho. Dine bed ni pinywa en Israel kata India, dine oweyo bedo ker owuon. Nifwenyo ni giluonge ni Mr Kenyatta, tiende ni giweyo miye luor monego mi ker."""
Constitutional lawyer Kibe Mungai, however, said it will be a Herculean task as the president enjoys majority support in both houses of bunge owing to his Handshake partner Raila Odinga.	Kibe Mungai ma en okil molony ahinya e weche Chik, wacho ni ok bi bedo mayot donjo ne ker e doho nikech en gi ji mang'eny masire e bunge chakre nobed gi winjruok gi Raila Odinga.
“It is not very new, it is a clarification that they are doing that to show the president can be sued in his personal capacity and not about his functions, for example, if a president is to rob a bank, he will be sued as an individual and not as the president,” said Mungai.	"Mungai nowacho kama, ""Ma ok eg gima wendo, kar mano imedo mana ler tiend gima nitiega ni inyalo donj ne ker e doho e wi ketho moro motimo ma ok otudore gi tije kaka ker. Kuom ranyisi, ka ker omonjo bengi mokwalo pesa, ibiro make kaka jakuo moro amora to donjne kaka ker."""
Secondly, the lawyers said the judgement revolved around the process used by President Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga on promoting the BBI.	Wach mar ariyo en ni okindego wacho ni bura ma ne ong'ad lworore mana kuom chenro ma ne Ker Uhuru Kenyatta kod Prime Minister machon Raila Odinga otiyogo e lando ote mar BBI.
The judges had ruled that the entire constitutional change process promoted by the BBI Steering Committee is unconstitutional, null and void.	Jong'ad bura nowacho ni chenro miluwo kitimo lokruoge e Chik kaka Komiti mar BBI dwaro en chenro ma ok owinjore gi chik kendo ok onyal tiyo.
According to lawyer Duncan Savwa, the judges’ decision meant the BBI process was built on quicksand, and the promoters have to go back to the drawing board.	Duncan Savwa ma be en okil molony e Chik, wacho ni bura mane ong'and e wi BBI odwoko chien joma ne riwo BBI lwedo kendo chuno ni gichak manyien.
“The implication of the pronouncement on the changes proposed in the BBI is that there is nothing in it that can be implemented given that the whole process was a nullity from the beginning when they started collecting signatures,” said Savwa.	"Savwa nowacho kama, ""Bura ma ne ong'ad nyiso ni lokruoge ma BBI oting'o ma ne onego otim e Chik koro ok nyal tiyo kata matin nikech chenro ma ne otigo e loso BBI ne oluwore gi Chik chakre chakruok mar choko sei."""
On the composition of the IEBC, Okatch stated that the judges got it wrong in declaring that the IEBC is not properly constituted.	Okatch nowacho ni jong'ad bura ne ni kare kane giwacho ni IEBC ok oting'o joma owinjore.
He said although the judges meant to say that their decision is only limited to the BBI case, the interpretation will mean that so many decisions that have been made by the commission from the time there were only three commissioners are null and void.	Okatch wacho ni kata obedo ni jong'ad bura temo wacho ni buchgi ne en mana e wi BBI, koyar tiend bura ma ne ging'ado biro nyiso ni yiero moko mang'eny ma ne otim gi commissioners mag IEBC e kinde ma ne gin mana ji adek kende koro ibiro kwan kaka yiero ma ok nyal tiyo.
“It means that even all the by-elections, which have been conducted by the commission are illegal and that they have no capacity to carry out any other election,” said Okatch.	"Okatch nowacho niya, ""Mano tiende ni yiero moko matindo (by-election) ma ne otim gi IEBC e kinde mokalo ne ok oluwore gi chik kendo IEBC ok nyal tayo ji e timo yiero machielo."""
Members of bunge allied to the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) say they are not interested in initiating an impeachment process despite Thursday's scathing court verdict for President Uhuru Kenyatta.	Jood bura mag bunge manie duond bura mar UDA (United Democratic Aliance) wacho ni ok gidhi kwayo mondo ogol ker e loch kata obedo bura ma ne ong'ad Tich Ang'wen ne ok odhi maber gi Ker Uhuru Kenyatta.
The High Court, while upholding a consolidated case by eight petitioners, said the 14-member Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) steering committee, which was gazetted by President Uhuru, and led by the late Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji, was unconstitutional. 	Doho Mamalo kang'ado bura e kes ma ne okel gi ji aboro nowacho ni Komiti mar BBI moting'o ji 14 ok owinjore gi chik. Komitino ne opwodh gi Ker Uhuru kendo nitaye gi Seneta mosenindo mar Garissa, Yusuf Haji.
The bench, led by Justice Joel Ngugi, said the president erred in initiating a process to change the constitution through a popular initiative. 	Jong'ad bura kotelnegi gi Jang'ad Bura Joel Ngugi nowacho ni ker ne ok otimo gimaber ka ne opwodho mondo olok Chik kokalo kuom choko sei kuom ji mang'eny.
The court also observed that Uhuru was in breach of the constitution - an impeachable offence.	Doho nong'ado ni ker noketho Chik, to mano en ketho mowinjore gi gole e loch.
On Friday, MPs Alice Wahome (Kandara) and Sylvanus Osoro (South Mugirango) said the judgement was a big win for the constitution and sovereignty of the people of Kenya.	Chieng Tich Abich, Jood Bura mag bunge Alice Wahome (Kandara) kod Sylvanus Osoro (South Mugirango), nowacho ni bura ma ne ong'adno ne en gima owinjore ahinya gi Chik kendo en bura ma ne omoro chuny jopiny.
“We celebrate the judiciary. They have redeemed the nation from the shackles of dictatorship.  You cannot make the constitution-making process your own bid. The document belongs to Kenyans. Ordinary Kenyans have been talking about all these issues,” said Wahome.	"Wahome nowacho kama: ""Wamor ahinya gi bura ma doho ong'ado. Giresowa wuok e loch ma ne chiegni lokore loch mar agoko. Ng'ato ok nyal bukore owuon ni odwa loko Chik. Chik en mar Jo-Kenya. Raia mapile osebedo ka wuoyo e wechegi duto."""
Wahome said the Head of State should make amends after threatening the constitution by first approving the appointment of 41 new judges who were forwarded to him in mid-2019.	Wahome nowacho ni ker onego okwong orie yorene kokalo kuom pwodho miyo tich jong'ad bura manyien 41 ma ne ochiw nyingegi e kor higa mar 2019.
“Our team is not interested in the impeachment process but we need President Uhuru Kenyatta to come out clear on some issues. The president was found to have breached the integrity and provisions of chapter six of the constitution. The Head of State has violated the constitution. Let him start by appointing judges. He has failed an honorary duty,” Wahome added.	"Wahome nomedo wacho niya, ""Jogo ma riwowa lwedo ok odich gi temo golo Ker Uhuru Kenyatta e loch, kata kamano wadware ni owuog olernwa weche moko. Noyudore ni ker ne oketho weche manie sula mar auchiel mar Chik. Jatend Piny noketho Chik. We ochak rieyo yorene kuom miyo tich jong'ad bura. Oserem e timo tich malong'o."""
According to Osoro, the Bill was gazetted against the wishes of ordinary citizens.	Osoro wacho ni ker nopwodho Bill mopogore gi dwach raia.
“We are on record in bunge that we wanted to know who gave the president powers to initiate such a process. They have wasted public resources to change the law illegally, “said Osoro.	"Osoro nowacho ni, ""Ne wawacho e bunge ni wadwaro ng'eyo ni e ng'a ma ne omiyo ker teko mar timo gimanotimono. Gitiyo marach gi mwandu sirkal e temo loko Chik e yo ma ok oluwore gi chik."""
Osoro said the president should explain how monies spent in the process will be recovered, and provide an outline on how the court’s concerns shall be resolved.	Osoro ne owacho ni ker onego ler kaka ibiro dwok pesa ma ne otigo e temo loko Chik, kendo owach kaka ibiro tim e weche ma doho nong'ado.
Any Kenyan can push the motion to impeach the president, but for now we have better things to do.	Ja-Kenya moro amora nyalo kwayo mondo ogol ker e loch, en mana ni sani wan gi weche mamoko madongo moloyo monego watim.
“The arrogance by some leaders, surrounding the president, has been put on hold. The blame is squarely on the country’s Attorney General. The brave judges have given this country time to celebrate. This is a jurisprudence across the world. Give people options on what they want to change,” added Osoro.	"Osoro nomedo wacho niya, ""Jotelo mamoko ma ne bayo ne ker wach koro osekue mos.

Bonchari, Juja by-elections in limbo as AG heads to Court of Appeal	Yiero matindo ma itimo Bonchari kod Juja obagni sama Attorney General dhi e Doho mar Apil
Two by-elections that are to be conducted next week may not happen following yesterday's High Court’s verdict that Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has no quorum.	Yiero matindo ariyo ma onego otim juma manyien samoro ok bi timore ka luwore gi bura ma ne Doho Mamalo ong'ado nyoro ni IEBC onge gi commissioners moromo.
While pleading with the High Court judges to suspend their finding on the IEBC’s quorum for at least 14 days, IEBC lawyer Eric Gumbo argued that the electoral agency was handicapped and that the by-elections in Bonchari and Juja constituencies may not happen next week.	Okil mar IEBC Eric Gumbo nosayo jong'ad bura mag Doho Mamalo mondo giwe bura ma ging'adone IEBC kuom ndalo 14, kendo nowacho ni IEBC nigi ng'ikruok moko ma dhi miyo kik tim yiero matindo juma manyien e constituency mar Bonchari kod Juja.
“On behalf of the IEBC, we have a unique concern that cannot wait. Because the court has touched on the quorum of the IEBC, the IEBC is put in an awkward position because of a by-election slated for Monday in Juja and another by-election in Bonchari,” the lawyer argued. He added that the Constitution required the commission to conduct a by-election within 90 days.	"Nowacho kama: ""E lo IEBC, wan gi kwayo makende ma wanyal dhi nyime rito. Doho oseng'ado wach e wi kwan mar ji monego ta IEBC, to mano ketowa e akere keke nikech nitie yiero matindo mane osachan motelo ni ibiro tim Juja Wuok Tich kod machielo Bonchari."" Nomedo lero ni Chik dwaro ni otim yiero matindo ka pok ndalo 90 okadho."
“The timelines within which the by-elections must be conducted have been defiled and are cast on stone. Because of that unique concern, if we will wait for the formal application, substantial prejudice will be prejudiced,” he said.	"Nowacho niya, ""Kinde moket monego timie yiero matindo osekadho to ok nyal lokgi. Nikech gima kende motimoreno, ka wadhi nyime rito mondo watim gik moko kaka ondiki, wabiro ketho chik."""
The decision by the five-judge bench not only affects the two by-elections, but they also have an implication on other by-elections conducted by the current commissioners.	Bura ma ne ong'ad gi jong'ad bura abichgo ok mul mana yiero matindo ariyogo kende, to bende gimulo yiero mamoko ma ne ota gi commissioners ma nitie sani.
Meanwhile, Attorney General Kihara Kairuki vowed to challenge the verdict on the Building Bridges Initiative before the Court of Appeal.	Attorney General Kihara Kairuki osingore ni obiro dhi e Doho mar Apil mondo okwed bura ma ne ong'ad e wi BBI.
In his application seeking to have the five-judge bench suspend the implementation of its judgment to allow him to appeal, Justice Kihara explained that he was aggrieved with the court’s decision that the process was illegal, adding that public interest on the matter needed an interpretation by a higher court.	Ka ne Kihara kwayo jong'ad bura abichgo mondo girit ka pok buchgi otiyo mondo oti gi thuolono e apil, nolero ni nochwanyore ka ne doho owacho ni chenro ma ne giluwo ok owinjore gi chik kae to nomedo ni dwach jopiny e wi wachno dwarore ni oler doho machielo maduong' moloyo.
According to him, the Amendment Bill, which was challenged before Justices Prof Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Teresiah Matheka and Chacha Mwita, was validated by 3 million Kenyans, passed by more than 24 counties, and subsequently passed by National Assembly and the Senate.	Owacho ni Amendment Bill ma ne opedh e nyim jong'ad bura Profesa Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Teresiah Matheka kod Chacha Mwita, ne opwodh gi Jo-Kenya milion adek e kaonti mokalo 24, kendo nopwodhe bende gi National Assembly kod Senate.
“It is in the public interest that pending the filing of the Appeal and to enable him to exercise his right of appeal, an interim stay of execution of the judgment be hereby stayed. It is critical to take judicial notice of the fact that the BBI process has been undertaken extensively, over 3 million signatures have been collected, to the critical constitutional processes such as consideration of the Bill by the county assemblies have been undertaken, the Amendment Bill has been passed by the majority members of the National Assembly and the Senate,” argued Solicitor General Ken Ogeto.	"Solicitor General Ken Ogeto nowacho kama: ""En gima owinjore gi dwach jopiny ni mondo okwa apil nikech mano en ratiro ma en go kendo onego owe kinde machuok okal ka pok bura ma ne ong'ad ochako tiyo.

“Second relates to that the judgment you have just rendered raises fundamental questions with far-reaching implications.

Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro kicked out of bunge for four days over claims of bribery	Ndindi Nyoro, Jaod Bura ma Kiharu, ogol oko mar bunge kuom ndalo ang'wen nikech weche asoya
Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro was on Thursday suspended from the National Assembly for four days for claiming that MPs were bribed to vote for the Building Bridges Initiatives (BBI) Bill.	Jaod Bura ma Kiharu, Ndindi Nyoro ne onyis chieng' Tich Ang'wen ni kik obi bunge kuom odiechinge ang'wen bang' hango wach ni ne omi jood bura asoya eka gigo ombulu ne BBI Bill.
National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi had summoned Nyoro and Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria to substantiate claims that some MPs were induced before they voted for the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020.	Spika mar National Assembly, Justin Muturi, noluongo Nyoro kod jaod bura ma Gatundu South, Moses Kuria mondo giler tiend wach ma wachore ni nitie jood bura moko ma ne omi asoya ka ne pok giyoyo ombulu ne Amendment Bill ma 2020.
The Speaker asked the Kiharu MP if he indeed called members conmen, cowards, sell outs and traitors.	Spika ne openjo jaod bura ma Kiharu ka be kuom adier ne oluongo jood bura ni jokuoge, ngoche kod jo-andhoga.
"""Did you make those allegations or not?"" Posed Muturi."	"Muturi nopenjo kama: ""Be ne iwacho wechego koso ooyo?"""
The MP said some members used their stomachs and were cowards, traitors and sell outs who bought and some voted because of the directives from their party leaders.	Jaod burano nowacho ni nitie jood bura moko ma igi lach kendo gin ngoche, noluongogi bende ni jo-andhoga ma ne ong'iew mondo ogo ombulu to moko notimo kamano nikech jotend duond bura mekgi nochiko kaka gigo ombulu.
"After protests by MPs, Muturi ruled to suspend Nyoro from the precincts of bunge for the next four days. ""Ndindi Nyoro is going to be suspended from this House including his office for the period of four days,"" he said."	"Bang' ka jood bura nong'ur, Muturi nowacho ni Nyoro ok onego onyon alwora mar bunge kuom ndalo ang'wen manoluwo. Nowacho kama, ""Ndindi Nyoro koro ok oyiene biro e bunge kae kata dhi e ofise kuom ndalo ang'wen."""
This means that the Kiharu MP will not be allowed to visit his office at the continental House.	Mano tiende ni ok bi yiene Jaod Bura ma Kiharu dhi e ofise mantie continental House.
Ruaraka MP TJ Kajwang said that Nyoro was putting the integrity of members at risk.  	Jaod Bura ma Ruaraka, TJ Kajwang' nowacho ni Nyoro ne ketho nying jood bura mamoko.
Earlier, the Gatundu MP had sensationally admitted in an interview with the BBC that he was induced with a bribe to vote for Majority Leader Amos Kimunya.	Noyudo ka Jaod Bura ma Gatundu owacho ka ne owuoyo e BBC ni ne omiye asoya mondo ogo ombulu ne jatend Majority Amos Kimunya.
Kuria told the BBC that inducement especially to pass government business was a normal affair in the National Assembly.	Kuria ne onyiso Jo-BBC ni kinde mang'eny ichunoga jood bura mondo opwodh wach moro ma sirkal dwaro kendo mano gimapile e National Assembly.
“It is not uncommon in Kenya for Members of bunge to be paid or compensated to vote in a particular way, especially when the government has an interest in a matter,” said Kuria	"Kuria nowacho niya, ""Ok en gima wendo Kenya winjo ni ochul Jood Bura mondo ogo ombulu e yo moro, to ahinya ahinya ichulogiga sama mana wach motudore gi sirkal."""
He claimed that he received Sh100,000 to vote for Kimunya, to take over from former Majority Leader and Garissa Township legislator Aden Duale in June last year.	Owacho ni nochule pesa maromo siling' 100,000 mondo ogone Kimunya ombulu, mondo okaw kar jatend Majority machon kendo Jaod Bura ma Garissa Aden Duale e dwe mar Jun higa mokalo.
“When the new Majority Leader was appointed because they were not elected, we went to the Majority Leader’s office and received a USD 1000 gift, this is common in bunge,” Kuria claimed.	"Kuria wacho niya, ""Ka ne oket Jatend Majority manyien nikech ne ok ogone ombulu, ne wadhi e ofis Jatend Majority kendo ne wayudo mich mar dola 1000, to mano gima jatimorega e bunge."""

Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi, cronies accused of squandering Covid-19 funds	Joma Gavana ma Wajir Mohamed Abdi noyiero wachore ni ochamo pesa mar Covid-19
Wajir County Assembly has accused the embattled Governor Mohamed Abdi of running down healthcare in the devolved unit.	County Assembly ma Wajir odonjone Gavana Mohamed Abdi ni ok ota maber migawo mar thieth e kaonti.
In his submission, Habaswein Ward MCA Abdirahman Dahir told a senatorial impeachment committee that money allocated for the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic was misappropriated, exposing the locals to a dilapidated healthcare system.	E barua ma ne ondiko ne komiti mar Senate mawinjo kwayo mar thicho oko gavana, MCA mar Habaswein Ward, Abdirahman Dahir nowacho ni pesa mane oket tenge ne mondo otigo e weche mag Covid-19 ne ok otigo e yo maber to mano hinyo raia nikech gionge gi gige thieth mowinjore.
The witness swore that the county boss and his cronies conspired to squander all the money allocated to the health docket.	Janeno ma ne wuoyo ne owacho ni gavana kaachiel gi joma noyiero nochamo pesa ma ne oket tenge ne weche thieth.
The submissions were made as the impeachment hearing entered its second day.	E odiechieng' mar ariyo mar winjo kwayo mar thicho oko gavana, ema nosome baruano.
“They did not spare a dime even during the time the county is faced with Covid-19. The money allocated for health care has been mismanaged with basic services such as free county ambulances in Eldas Constituency being available for those who can pay for it, money allocated for fuel and maintenance services also found its way to personal pockets,” claimed the witness.	"Janeno ma ne wuoyo ne owacho ni "" Ne ok giweyo kata pesa matin mondo okony e kinde Covid-19. Pesa ma ne oket tenge ne weche thieth osetigo marach kuom ranyisi, ambulance mag kaonti ma onego oti nono konyo mana jogo manyalo chulo pesa, to bende osecham pesa mane oket ni inyiewogo mo ne gechego kaachiel gi ritigo."""
But Lawyer Ndegwa Njiru, representing the governor, moved to dismantle some of the claims describing the witness as “having nothing useful to add other than lies presented in the affidavit”.	Kata kamano, okil mar gavana, Ndegwa Njiru nowacho ni weche ma janenono wacho gin miriambo kendo ni onge gima janenono wacho manyalo konyo.
He questioned the witness qualifications to determine if healthcare was not being managed as required after Dahir claimed that he has been visiting various public hospitals in the county to establish their status.	Nowacho ni janenono ok olony e weche thieth omiyo oonge gi ratiro mar wacho ni gik moko ok timre e yo malong'o e thieth bang' ka Dahir nowacho ni osewuothoe e osiptende mopogore opogore mag sirkal mondo onon kaka gichalo.
The witness could also not provide documentation to prove that money allocated for the department was squandered by the executive.	Bende, janenono ne onge gi otese moro amora ma ne nyalo siro gima nowacho ni gavana kaachiel gi lange nochamo pesa mar thieth.
The MCA claimed that it was an open secret that Wajir County’s health care system is at its worse since independence.	MCA nowacho ni yore thieth e kaonti mar Wajir sani rach moloyo kinde moro amora.
“The people of Habaswein Ward have not been spared by the greed and insatiable urge for money from the team of the governor and his cronies. The Habaswein Sub County Referral Hospital has been dragged into a crisis,” he alleged.	"Nowacho kama, ""Jogo manie Habaswein Ward hinyore nikech ich lach kod kuwo mar pesa mitimo gi gavane gi lange. Giserwako e chandruok osiptal mar Habaswein Sub County Referral Hospital."""
He claimed that the Griftu Sub-County Referral Hospital was shut down after its casual laborer’s downed their tools citing poor working conditions and delayed payment of their wages.	Nowacho ni ne olor Griftu Sub-County Referral Hospital bang' ka jotich ma ne tiyo kuno noweyo tich nikech ok omi alwora maber mar tich to bende osara margi ne lewo.
He added that most public hospitals in the county suffer from an acute lack of medical supplies and equipment needed for the day-to-day running of the facilities.	Nomedo wacho ni osiptende mang'eny mag sirkal e kaontino onge gi yedhe kod masinde moromo manyalo konyogi odiechieng' kodiechieng'.
He said that despite the county government receiving funds from various sources in the fight against Covid-19 pandemic, there was little to show for the mobilised resources.	Nowacho bende ni kata obedo ni sirkand kaonti noyudo pesa koa kuonde mopogore opogre mondo okony e masira mar Covid-19, onge gima long'o manyiso kaka pesago notiyo.
The monies included Sh5 billion conditional grant; funds from the ministry of health allocated for Covid-19 emergency allowance for frontline health care workers; Sh9,450,000 from the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA); and Sh194,000,00 appropriated from the Wajir County Supplementary Budget 2019/2020.	Pesago oriwo siling' bilion abich ma sirkal chiwoga ne kaonti, pesa moa e ministry mar thieth moket mondo okony jogo makonyo e thiedho Covid-19, Sh 9,450,000 moa kuom Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), kod Sh 194,000,000 moa e balang' ma ne odong' e bajet ma 2019/2020 mar kaonti mar Wajir.
The witness claimed that the county government embarked on a shopping spree and began the journey for the creation of Covid-19 billionaires by squandering money it had received to combat the disease.	Janeneno ne owacho ni sirkand kaonti ma Wajir ne ochako ng'iewo gik moko ohel-ohel  to mano ne omiyo e kinde mar Covid-19 joma ne chamo pesa monego tigo e thieth obedo momewo ahinya.
“This was done in blatant disregard of the guidelines and caps set by the Constitution of Kenya 2010, the County Government Act, the Public Finance Act and the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act No. 33 of 2015 and the Records Disposal Act Chapter 14 of the Laws of Kenya,” he added.	"Nomedo niya, ""Gik ma ne gitimogo ok oluwore gi chike moket e Chik mar Kenya 2010, County Government Act, Public Finance Act kod Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act Na. 33 mar higa 2015 kaachiel gi Records Disposal Act Sula mar 14 e Chike mag Kenya."""
Earlier, the defense lawyers sought to discount submission by Diff Ward MCA Shueb Bare Ahmed, who linked the family to several companies that traded with the county government.	Noyudo ka chien kanyo okinde osetemo kwedo weche mane Diff Ward MCA Shueb Bare Ahmed owacho kane owacho ni jood gavana nigi tudruok gi kembe ma ne timo ohala gi sirkand kaonti.
Lawyer Njiru pushed the witness to provide any documentation linking the said firms to the family members of the governor. The witness could not provide form CR12 to prove directorship.	Okil Njiru ne okwayo janeno mondo ochiw otese manyiso ni nitie tudruok e kind kembego kod jood gavana. Janeno ne ok nyal chiwo fom miluongo ni CR12 ma ne dhi wacho gadier ng'ama tayo kembego.
The defense team also sought to know the source of bank statements that the witness used to demonstrate how the companies wired kickbacks to the governor’s wife, Khaire Omar, immediately after they received payments.	Okinde mag gavanda nokwayo mondo onyisgi kama janeno noyudoe otese mag bengi manyiso ni kembego ne ochulo pesa chi gavana, Khaire Omar bang' ka kembego noyudo pesa.
“It is your evidence that the first lady has been running affairs of the county. Which department of the county; the executive or the assembly? You have said that for you to be paid you have to seek the blessings of the first lady, what kind of blessings?” posed the lawyer.	"Okilno ne openjo kama, ""Iwacho ni chi gavana ema ne tayo gik matimore e kaonti. Nyiswa ane migawo mane otayo, executive koso od bura? Iwacho bende ni mondo ne chul ng'ato pesa ne nyaka chi gavana guedhe komondi, mago ne gueth mage?"""
“I want you to take us to that particular accounts that you said have received the monies. How did you get hold of the bank statement?’ he went on.	"Nohi nyime penjo kama: ""Adwaro ni inyiswa akaont sie mar bengi miwacho ni noyudo pesa. Ere kaka niyudo otese mag bengi moting'o akaontno?"""
The MCA said he obtained the documents from a whistleblower, who he could not name.	MCA nodwko ni ne oyudo otesego kuom ng'at ma ne dwa nyenyo e lela mibadhi matimore kata kamano ne ok ofulo nyinge.
The witness could also not provide documentary evidence that the governor’s spouse chaired several meetings of the executive.	Janenono bende ne ok nyal chiwo otese manyiso ni chi gavana ema ne otayo romo ma ne itimoga gi executive.
When pressed, he said some of the meetings were informal as they took place at the governor’s private home.	Ka ne ochune mondo owuo, ne owacho ni moko kuom romo ma ne gitimo ne gibedego e od gavana.
The committee suggested that they may consider writing to banks named in the transactions to authenticate bank statements provided by the county assembly.	Komiti nowacho ni samoro gibiro oro kwayo margi ne bengi ma ne oluong nyinggi mondo giwach ane ka be otese mag bengi ma ne ochiwgo ni kare.
“There has been question on the source of documents. I want to be on record that if we compel the said institutions to provide the documents, is it what you have attached that we will get?’ Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja posed.	"Seneta ma Nairobi, Johnson Sakaja nopenjo kama, ""Jomoko osepenjo kama igole otese mag bengi. Daher penjo ni ka wapenjo bengi miwachogo mondo ochiw otese mekgi, be gibiro chalo gi ma imiyowagi?"""
Navakholo MP Emmanuel Wangwe has said the BBI proposals will change Kenya's political structure and secure everybody's interests.	Jaod Bura ma Navakholo Emmanuel Wangwe nowacho ni BBI biro loko siasa ma Kenya kendo obiro kelo ber ne jopiny.
Wangwe said the overwhelming endorsement of the BBI Bill in both houses of bunge demonstrates that the president is fully in charge and his ‘foot soldiers’ are keen to deliver on his agenda.	Wangwe nowacho ni nikech ji mang'eny nosiro BBI e bunge, mano nyiso ni kuom adier ker tiyo tije kendo 'jolweny' meke oikore lando otene.
“By garnering a rare more than two-thirds in the National Assembly and the Senate, President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga have flexed their political muscle and showed they are the real heavyweights,” he said.	"Nowacho kama: ""Ker Uhuru Kenyatta kod Jatend duond bura mar ODM Raila Odinga onyiso adier kaka gin gi teko mang'eny ahinya e siasa kokalo kuom yudo ombulo mokalo 2/3 e National Assembly kod Senate."""
The legislator who doubles up as the Majority Chief Whip said proposals in the BBI Bill will be a game-changer in Kenyan politics.	Jaod Burano ma bende en Majority Chief Whip nowacho ni weche manie BBI biro kelo lokruoge madongo e siasa ma Kenya.
“The proposed sharing of power in the Executive and strengthened oversight roles will alter governance in a big way and the winner will be the common man. The new structure will also promote inclusivity and make more communities feel represented in the highest offices,” he said.	"Nowacho ni, ""Paro midwaro kel mondo joloch obed mang'eny kendo medo migepe mag joloch biro kelo lokruok maduong' ahiniya to raia ema biro yudo ber. Lokruok manyienno biro miyo ji duto thuolo kendo ji ma wuok e oganda mopogore opogore biro yudo tich e ofise mag loch madongo."""
His sentiments come as the High Court is set to rule on the BBI process today.	Nowacho wechego sama Doho Mamalo ikore mar chiwo buchgi e wi BBI kawuono.
Wangwe said after the verdict, BBI proponents will go to mwananchi and convince them to support the draft ahead of the referendum.	Wangwe nowacho bang' ka noseng'ad bura ni jogo mariwo BBI lwedo onego odhi owuo gi raia mondo gisir BBI ka pok referendum ochopo.
“We are ready to campaign for the BBI proposals and bring more Kenyans on our side. We must continue the pursuit of a more progressive society. More money is being taken to the ground through the BBI proposals, hence our support,” he said.	"Nowacho ni, ""Waseikore timo kampen mar BBI mondo Jo-Kenya mang'eny oriwwa lwedo. Nyaka wadhi nyime kedo mondo wabed oganda matimo dongruok. Pesa mang'eny sani dhi ne raia nikech BBI to mano emomiyo giriwowa lwedo."""
He said politics is about numbers where leaders stand to be counted on a particular issue.	Nowacho ni siasa en mar nono ng'at ma nigi ji mang'eny kama jatelo chung' mondo okwan ni ji adi maluwe e wi wach moro.
“Before the vote in both houses, there was talk of resistance to the BBI Bill, but when the lawmakers were called to vote, they endorsed the proposed constitutional amendments overwhelmingly. This also shows Kenyans are ready to improve the 2010 Constitution for a more just and progressive future,”  he said.	"Nowacho kama: ""Ka ne pok wagoyo ombulu e National Assembly kod Senate, nitie ji mang'eny ma ne kwedo Bill mar BBI. Kata kamano, ka ne oluong jood bura mondo gigo ombulu, ji mang'eny ahinya kuomgi ne opwodhe. Mano nyiso ni Jo-Kenya oikore loko Chik ma 2010 mondo gibed gi dongruoge mabeyo e kinde mabiro."""
The approval of  the referendum bill by lawmakers allied to Deputy President William Ruto has  brought to the fore the reality of politics as a competition for allocation and retention of resources.	Nikech jood bura ma ne omakore Jalup Ker William Ruto ne ogoyo ombulu ne BBI, mano okonyo ji fwenyo ni siasa en aena piem e wi yudo mwandu.
By voting in support of the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill 2020 – after opposing the document for more than a year – a section of Ruto-supporting MPs and Senators gave the strongest indication that they can easily switch camps ahead of the 2022 elections based on personal and regional interests.	Seneta kod jood bura ma omakore gi Ruto osebedo ka kwedo BBI kuom higa achiel, kata kamano, kane gigoyo ombulu ne Amendment Bill 2020, mano ne onyiso ni ginyalo weyo riwo Ruto lwedo ka pok yiero ma 2022 ochopo ka giluwo dwachgi kod mag raia maggi.
Some key DP allies in Coast, North Eastern, Mt Kenya, Western and Kisii voted in support of the Bill, a rude awakening likely to send the DP back to the drawing board to identify dependable foot soldiers ahead of the succession battle.	Moko kuom joma nigi huma mane omakore gi Ruto ne wuok Coast, North Eastern, Mt Kenya, Western kod Kisii to ne gigoyo ombulu ne Bill mar BBI. Gima notimoreno onego oyaw wang' Ruto mondo ochak manyo manyien jogo manyalo makore kode kolaro bedo ker e yiero ma higa manyien.
Of the 320 MPs who voted in the second reading, 235 voted in support, 83 voted against while two abstained.	Ka ne Bill nie kidieny misome mar ariyo, jood bura 320 ne ogoyo ombulu kendo jood bura 235 noriwe lwedo, 83 nokwedo to ariyo ne ok oyiero moro amora.
On Wednesday, a section of Ruto allies described their colleagues who voted in support of the BBI as political flip-floppers and cowards, who cannot be relied on for the 2022 battle.	Chieng' Tich Adek, grup moro momakore gi Ruto noluongo jowetegi ma ne ogoyone BBI ombulu ni gin joma bagni kendo jomoluor, ma ok nyal keto geno kuomgi e yiero mabiro 2022.
But others claimed that fear of backlash forced some MPs to back the Bill since their counties were benefiting from additional resources and constituencies while others claimed state intimidation.	Jomoko to wacho ni Jood Bura moko nogoyo ombulu ne Bill mar BBI nikech kaonti ma giwuokie kod constituency mekgi ne yudo kony mowuok kuom sirkal ma dine ok gigoyo ombulu dine giweyo yudo kony.
But allies of President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga said the vote was a lesson to Ruto that he cannot win votes outside Rift Valley without working with regional kingpins.	Kata kamano, jogo momakore gi Ker Uhuru Kenyatta kaachiel kod Jatend duond bura mar ODM, Raila Odinga wacho ni okang' ma ne giyombogo onego opuonj Ruto ni onyal yuda kura oko mar Rift Valley ka ok makore gi Raila kata ker.
They claimed that Ruto had been relying on political lightweights, who can not stand up against their regional supremos to deliver votes.	Ne giwacho ni joma Ruto nomakore gin joma onge mbi mar siasa kendo kata mana joma nie gweng'gi ne nyalo chung' ma yombgi e ombulu.
“Definitely both camps will undergo some political realignments ahead of the polls. I was not surprised by some of my colleagues. But it is good to have a stand; because if you have been singing anti-BBI songs but when it comes to voting, you go YES; people will say you do not have a stand,” said Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa, a Ruto ally.	"Jaod Bura ma Kimilimili, Didmus Barasa ma omakore gi Ruto nowacho kama, ""Onge kiawa ni grube ariyogo duto biro bedo gi lokruoge moko ka pok yiero ochopo. Gima jowetena notimo ne ok okawa gi wuoro.

“Voting YES means you agree with the document. They have weakened themselves and are people who cannot be depended on. You cannot be saying any all this time and when it comes to voting you say YES. That was cowardice of them,” he added.	"Nomedo niya, ""Goyo ombulu ne BBI tiende en ni iyie gi gik mondik e iye. Ginyiso ni gin joma yomyom ma ok nyal gen.

Garissa Township MP Aden Duale said some MPs, who were opposed to the Bill but voted in support of it, were scared of political backlash from their backyard as they stand to benefit from the additional constituencies.	Aden Duale ma en Jaod Bura ma Garissa Township nowacho ni jood bura moko mane kwedo BBI to pod nogoyone ombulu, ne oluor ni gik mabeyo ne dhi bayogi nikech ne idhi mednegi constituency.
Duale was one of the few MPs from North Eastern, who voted against the Bill last week on Thursday.	Duale en achiel kuom joma nok mawuok North Eastern ma ne ok ogoyo ne Bill mar BBI ombulu chieng' Tich Ang'wen.
“When the rubber meets the road, I will not think twice on my political affiliation, political formation or personal interest; I will think of the interest of Muslim community and by extension Somali community,” said Duale.	"Duale ne owacho niya, ""Sama weche ochopo kama tek, ok abi ng'iyo ni an ja-duond bura mane kata ng'iyo dwacha awuon, kar mano abiro rango dwaro mag Jo-Islam kod Jo-Somali modak e alworana."""
“I have been consistent in defending the right of the people and I will not think about my political affiliation even if I am the only one standing. Without any contradiction, among the things in BBI that I do not agree with is on the issue of representation and resources.  If my region gained in terms of resources, I would have voted yes,”  he added.	"Nomedo wacho niya, ""Asebedo kakedo gi kinda ne ratiro mag raia kendo ok ang'iyo ni an e duond bura mane kata ka adong' kenda kuno.

Duale disclosed that MPs backing Ruto were told to make independent decisions based on how their regions were going to be affected by the document.	Duale wacho Jood Bura momakore gi Ruto ne onyis mondo giyier kaka gigoyo ombulu kaluwore gi kaka BBI wacho ni ibiro pog ne alwora margi mwandu.
Aldai MP Cornelly Serem said that it was the creation of the media that Ruto was opposed to the BBI Bill.	Jaod Bura ma Aldai, Cornelly Serem nowacho ni gige fwambo gi keyo ema ne omiyo ji obedo gi paro ni Ruto kwedo BBI.
Serem noted that Ruto and his allies only raised issues with certain clauses and did not ask MPs to vote against the document.	Serem nowacho ni Ruto kod joge ne kwedo mana moko kuom weche manie  BBI kendo ne onyiso Jood Bura mondo kik gigo ombulu.
“We did not tell people to vote in a certain way. We told our people to look at their regional interests. It was never a contest. There was no time we said we were going to vote No,” said the MP who voted against the Bill.	"Jaod Bura ma ne ok ogoyone Bill mar BBI ombulu wacho kama: ""Ne ok wanyiso ji kaka onego gigo ombulu.

Some of the notable Ruto allies that voted in support of the Bill include Kimani Ngunjiri (Bahati), Feisal Bader (Msambweni), Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga), David Sankok (nominated), Kareke Mbiuki (Maara), Joash Nyamoko (North Mugirango), William Chepkut (Ainabkoi), Purity Kathambi (Njoro), David Gikaria (Nakuru East) and Malulu Injendi.

Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu said that the DP was depending on the wrong people for his 2022 presidential bid. He claimed that most of the MPs cannot sacrifice for Ruto and were only with him for personal benefit.	Jaod Bura mar Nyeri Town, Ngunjiru Wambugu nowacho ni Jalup Ker ne oketo kuom joma ok owinjore mondo okonye bedo ker 2022.

“What they did means that they can switch camps at any moment. Very few people are ready to sacrifice for standing with Ruto, they will all vanish if their survival is threatened,” said Mr Wambugu.	"Wambugu nowacho niya, ""Gima ne gitimono nyiso ni ginyalo lokore sa asaya. Ji matin ahinya ema oyie chiwore mondo gimakre gi Ruto, jomoko to biro ringo ka gineno ka weche ok dhi negi maber."""
“The people the DP has are not committed to his course. The vote shows that the DP does not have a hold of people outside Rift Valley. He will have to go to the regional kingpins that he has been avoiding if he is serious with his bid. The vote has essentially made him realise that politics is local,” he added.	"Nomedo niya, ""Jogo ma luwo Jalup Ker ok omakore kode gadier. Ombulu ma ne ogono ne onyiso Jalup Ker onge gi joma omakore kode e oko mar Rift Valley.

The Uhuru ally said that Ruto can only bank on Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichungwa and Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira) from Mt Kenya.	Jalno ma en ng'at ma riwo lwedo Uhuru, ne owacho ni Ruto nyalo mana geno kuom Jaod Bura ma Kikuyu, Kimani Ichungwa kod Jaod Bura ma Mathira, Rigathi Gachagua e alwora mar Mt Kenya.
Cotu boss Francis Atwoli, a proponent of BBI, said the vote reduced the DP to a community leader, who has no support outside his Rift Valley turf.	Jatend COTU, Francis Atwoli, ma riwo lwedo BBI, ne owacho ni ombulu ma ne ogono ne onyiso ni Ruto en jasiasa ma onge gi mbi kendo onge joma sire oko mar Rift Valley.
Mr Atwoli said that those who do not believe in the BBI will be reduced to political spectators in Uhuru’s succession.	Atwoli bende nowacho ni jogo ma ok riw lwedo BBI biro bedo maonge teko mar siasa bang' ka Uhuru osewuok e loch.
“Politics is like a heavy downpour, when it rains the water will always find its natural course. That is exactly what happened in the National Assembly. If you don’t believe in the handshake you will be a spectator in the succession politics,” he said.	"Nowacho kama, ""Siasa chalo gi kodh ohula machwe matek, ohulano yudoga kende yo moringe. Mano e gima notimore e Od Bura. Ka ok riw lwedo winjruok mantie e kind Uhuru gi Raila, ibiro dong' ma onge teko siasa bang' ka oselok loch."""
“The landscape of 2022 is now taking shape and the vote shows that he has no committed political allies; after this vote he was reduced a community leader. Political realignments are out there for everyone to see,” added Atwoli.	"Atwoli nomedo niya, ""Piny osekawo kore e wi kaka weche biro chalo 2022 kendo ombulu ma ne ogo nyiso ni Ruto onge gi joma omakore kode, ombuluno oweye kodong' jasiasa moluor mana e alwora mowukie kende.

He said that those who rely on huge political rallies as a sign of popularity will be shocked when the people cast the ballot for the next president.	Nowacho ni jogo ma paro ni jasiasa mogeno e chokruork mag siasa madongo kaka gima nyiso ni gin gi jolup mang'eny biro bwok sama ji goyo ombulu ne ker maluwo.
National Assembly Minority Whip Junet Mohammed said that Ruto has been banking on the wrong people for his political bid.	Junet Mohamed ma en Minority Whip e Od Bura, ne owacho ni Ruto osebedo kogeno kuom josiasa ma ok owinjore mondo osire bedo ker.
Junet claimed that some of the MPs were with the DP for “tokens” but will leave him when elections are called.	Junet nowacho ni moko kuom Jood Bura ma ne riwo lwedo Ruto ne omakore kode mana nikech pesa mimiyogi, kata kamano gibiro weye sama itimo yiero.
“These are people who are with him because of his money, at the end of it all they will go back to supporting the Handshake. Look at the total number of MPs in Central; only 10 per cent are with him based on the vote,” he said.	"Nowacho kama, ""Jogi nomokore kode mana nikech pesa momiyogi, to bang'e gibiro weye mondo gimakre gi Uhuru gi Raila. Kaluwore gi kwan ombulu mag Jood Bura mawuok Central, pasent apar kende ema omakore kode."""
Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju said he was not surprised by the turn of events.	Jagoror maduong' mar duond bura  mar Jubilee, Raphael Tuju, ne owacho en ok obwok gi weche notimore.
“A politician can change anytime. Very few politicians can be relied on,” said Tuju.	"Tuju nowacho kama: ""Jasiasa nyalo lokore sa asaya. Mana josiasa manok ema inyalo gen."""
The powerful Jubilee Party organ has endorsed the purge of three MPs for opposing the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) and supporting the ideals of other parties.	Joduond bura mar Jubilee dwaro ni oriemb oko Jood Bura adek ma ne okwedo BBI kendo riwo lwedo dwaro mag duond bura mamoko.
The National Management Committee (NMC) yesterday directed the party’s disciplinary committee to begin the process that could lead to the expulsion of Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria, Nominated MP Cecily Mbarire and Nominated Senator Millicent Omanga.	Komiti miluongo ni National Management Committee (NMC) nowacho nyoro ni komiti ma kumo ji e duond bura onego ochak chenro ma gikone biro golo oko e duond bura Jaod Bura ma Gatundu South, Moses Kuria, Jaod Bura Moyier gi duond bura Cecily Mbarire kod Seneta Moyier gi duond bura, Milicent Omanga.
In yesterday’s meeting at Jubilee headquarters, the NMC noted that the Gatundu South MP has been espousing the ideals of the People’s Empowerment Party (PEP) in contravention of the Political Parties Act.	E romo ma ne otim nyoro e ofis maduong' mar Jubilee, NMC ne owacho ni Jaod Bura ma Gatundu South osebedo ka riwo lwedo weche mag duond bura mar People's Empowerment Party (PEP), to mano opogore gi gima chik wacho e Political Parties Act.
Jubilee vice chair David Murathe said they had zeroed in on Mr Kuria for supporting George Koimburi, a PEP candidate, for the Juja by-election yet Jubilee has a candidate.	Jakony mar jakom mar Jubilee, David Murathe, nowacho ni gisefwenyo ni Mr Kuria ne siro George Koimburi, ma ne omi otiko gi duond bura mar PEP to Jubilee be nigi ng'at ma gimiyo otiko mondo olargo kom e yiero matin ma idhi tim Juja.
The by-election in Juja was occasioned by the demise of MP Francis Waititu popularly know as Wakapee on February 22 and Jubilee fronted his widow, Susan Njeri Waititu. 	Yiero matin ma dhi timore Juja dhi bedoe nikech tho mar Jaod Bura Francis Waititu mane ong'ere kaka Wakapee. Ne otho tarik 22, Februar kae to Jubilee ne oyiero chiege, Susan Njeri Waititu mondo okaw kare.
The by-election is scheduled for May 18.	Yier matin dhi timore e dwe mar Mei tarik 18.
Mr Murathe said the MP has been actively campaigning for Mr Koimburi.	Murathe nowacho ni Jaod Burano osebedo ka kampen gi kinda ne Koimburi.
“We have asked the Jubilee disciplinary committee to take up the matter and summon him to answer to the accusations. If he is culpable, we will remove him from the party through expulsion; we must retain discipline in our party,” said Murathe.	"Murathe nowacho niya, ""Wasenyiso komiti machiwo kum e Jubilee mondo onon ane wachno kendo giluonge mondo giwinj gima owacho e weche modonjne godogo. Koyude ni en gi ketho, wabiro riembe owuog e duond bura marwa. Ji nyaka rit chik marwa mar duond bura."""
He said Ms Omanga and Ms Mbarire will face the disciplinary committee for voting against the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2020.	Nowacho ni Omanga kaachiel gi Mbarire biro romo gi komiti machiwo kum nikech ne ok gigoyo ombulu ne Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2020.
Murathe said support for BBI was a party position and therefore those who voted against it did so in disregard of the same.	Murathe nowacho ni riwo lwedo BBI ne en gima giwonjoree kaka duond bura, omiyo jogo ma ne otimo kamano ne onyiso achaya ne duond bura.
During debate preceding the voting at the National Assembly, Mbarire was among the MPs who passionately spoke out against the BBI Bill, arguing it clawed back the gains of the 2010 Constitution.	E romo ma ne otim ka pok ogo ombulu e Od Bura, Mbarire en achiel kuom jood bura ma ne okwedo mager Bill mar BBI kowacho ni BBI dhi mayo ji ber ma waseyudo nikech Chik ma 2010.
“The minute we have the Executive be the head of bunge and the Judiciary, then this would be the beginning of the end of democracy. This Bill takes away the gains we fought for with our lives and sweat and blood and should it pass, one day we will regret our decision,” she said.	"Nowacho kama, ""Ka wayie mondo ker obed gi teko e wi Od Bura kaachiel Chenro mag Doho, mano biro bedo chakruok mar giko demokrasi. Bill  mar BBI dhi mayowa gik mabeyo masekedo mwayudo to ka wapwodhe, chieng' moro wabiro ywago ang'e."""
She added, “Where will we get justice if a judge knows that they could easily lose their job?” 	"Nomedo ni, ""Wabiro yudo kanye bura makare ka jang'ad bura oluor ni onyalo lalo tije?"""
Senator Omanga opposed the Bill, saying it would put more pressure on the ‘hustlers’ who were already suffering because of the poor economic situation.	Seneta Omanga nokwedo Bill mar BBI kowacho ni gino biro medo hinyo jogo ma sani onge tich kendo ma yuto margi ni piny to ngima tek.
“The Bill will see over-taxation of the hustlers. I oppose it,” said Omanga.	"Omanga nowacho niya, ""Bill mar BBI biro medo osuru ne joma yuto margi ni piny. An akwedo BBI."""
For their opposition to the Bill, Mbarire and Omanga will have a date with the Lumatete Muchai-led Jubilee disciplinary committee.	Mbarire kod Omanga biro romo gi komiti machiwo kum mitayo gi Lumatete Muchai nikech ne gikwedo bill mar BBI
This will not be the first time Omanga is facing the committee. 	Ma ok dhi bedo kinde mokwongo ma Omanga romoe gi komiti.
Last year, she was among five other nominated senators who were accused of openly defying their party leader during the Senate leadership purge.	Higa mokalo, ne en achiel kuom seneta moyier gi duond bura ma ne otamore e lela luwo gima jatend duond bura margi nyisogi.
The others were Mary Seneta, Falhada Iman, Naomi Waqo, Alice Milgo and Isaac Mwaura.	Jomamoko ma ne oromo gi komiti e kindeno ne gin Mary Seneta, Falhada Iman, Naomi Waqo, Alice Milgo kod Isaac Mwaura.
The National Executive Council had endorsed their removal, but the Political Parties and Dispute Tribunal saved them.	Migawo mar National Executive Council ne dwaro riembogi, kata kamano, migawo mar Political Parties and Dispute Tribunal noresogi.
The six were accused of snubbing a State House meeting last year where President Kenyatta had sought to ratify removal of Deputy President William Ruto’s allies, Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and his Nakuru counterpart Susan Kihika from Leader of Majority and Majority Whip positions, respectively.	Ne odonj ne ji auchielgo gi ketho mar tamruok biro e romo ma ne otim State House higa mokalo kama Ker Kenyatta ne dwaro mondo ogol oko e migepegi jogo ma omakore gi Jalup Ker William Ruto, ma ne gin Seneta Kipchumba Murkomen ma en Jatend Majority kod Seneta ma Nakuru Susan Kihika ma en Majority Whip.

Also targeted for removal is UDA Secretary-General Veronica Maina, who Jubilee has accused of serving in positions of two political outfits.	Ng'at machielo ma ne idwaro ma migawo ma ne en go ne en Secretary General mar UDA, Veronica Maina ma duond bura mar Jubilee ne odonjone ni en gi migepe e duond bura ariyo mag siasa.
Before joining UDA, Ms Maina held a senior position in Jubilee.	Maina ne nigi migawo maduong' e duond bura mar Jubilee ka ne pok oriwore gi UDA.
Murathe said they had also agreed as NMC that they were interested in the party resolution mechanism that UDA had sought for after they wrote to the Registrar of Political Parties seeking dissolution of a 2018 partial coalition pact with PDR, now UDA.	Murathe nowacho ni ne giwonjore kaka NMC ni ne gidwaro ng'eyo gima duond bura mar UDA oyiero bang' ka ne gisekwayo mondo Registrar mar duond bura mag Siasa ogol winjruok ma ne gitimo 2018 gi PDR ma sani en UDA.

“As provided for in the coalition agreement deposited in your office on May 30, 2018, in compliance with Section 10 (4) of the Political Parties Act No 11 of 2012 Schedule 3 thereof, and further pursuant to provisions of Article 6 of the said Coalition agreement, we have therefore declared dispute,” Maina said.	"Maina nowacho kama, ""E barua mane wakwayogo donjo e winjruok tarik 30 Mei, 2018, kaluwore gi weche manie paragraf mar ang'wen e kidieny mar 10 e Chik duond bura mag Siasa Na 11 Chenro mar 3, to kendo kaluwore gi weche moket e Sula mar 6 e barua ma mane wadonjogo e winjruok, sani koro wakwayo pogore kik wabed e winjruok."""
Last year, the party removed MPs allied to Ruto from plum positions in bunge, including former National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale, Senate Deputy Speaker Kithure Kindiki and Meru Senator Mithika Linturi. 	Higa mokalo, duond bura mar Jubilee nomayo Jood Bura momakore gi Ruto migepe ma gin-go e Od Bura, to jogo noriwo Jatend Majority machon Aden Duale, Jalup Spika mar Senate, Kithure Kindiki kod Seneta ma Meru, Mithika Linturi.

Garissa MCAs have started the process of removing Speaker Ahmed Ibrahim Abass from office over alleged gross misconduct.	MCA ma Garissa osechako luwo chenro mar golo oko e tich Spika Ahmed Ibrahim nikech gik mane otimo ma ok owinjore.
About 36 ward reps have already signed the motion accusing the speaker of gross violation of the Constitution.	Chiegni MCA 36 oseketo sei margi ka giwacho ni spika ne oketho Chik e okang' marach ahinya.
Led by Maalimin MCA Mohamud Aden, the mover of the motion, the MCAs said yesterday they were waiting for the assembly clerk to officially notify the speaker of their intention to impeach him.	MCA mar Maalimin, Mohamud Aden, ma otelone wach mar golo spika oko, nowacho nyoro en kaachiel gi MCA mamoko ni girito mondo klak mar od bura mar kaonti onyis spika ni gidwaro thiche oko.
“We have officially filed a notice of motion by way of impeachment motion in accordance with the Constitution,” said the statement read by Aden on behalf of his colleagues.	"Aden ne owacho kama e lo MCA wetene, ""Ka luwore gi Chik dwaro, waseoro kwayo marwa mondo wabed piny e od bura wagol spika oko."""
"The MCAs also accused the speaker of incompetence and gross misconduct, saying he has been running the House like a ""kiosk"" in total disregard of the procedures."	MCA-go bende ne owacho ni spika osebedo ka timo tije o yo malong'o ka giwacho ni spika tayo od bura ka ng'at mauso e duka nikech oluw weche manie chik.
At the same time, Dadaab MCA Mohamed Abdi said the motion was not about clan or politics.	MCA ma Dadaab, Mohamed Abdi nowacho ni gidwar golo spika mana nikech weche anyuola kata siasa.
“We would like to assure members of the public and the executive that there will be no interruption of services as we execute the legislative process,” he said.	"Nowacho kama, ""Dwaher nyiso raia ni kod joma nie bura mar executive ni gik moko biro dhi nyime timore kaka pile sama waluwo chenro mar golo spika e ofis."""
This is not the first time the speaker is facing an impeachment motion. Early last year, a group of MCAs started the impeachment process, but it flopped after they failed to reach the threshold required.	Ma ok e kinde mokwongo ma gitemo golo spika e ofis. E chak higa mokalo, nitie grup moo mar MCA ma ne ochako luwo chenro mar golo spika kata kamano, ne girem nikech ne ok gichopo kwan madwarore.
The speaker, who is the former Ijara MP, is a close confidant of Governor Ali Korane.	Spikano ma en Jaod Bura machon mar Ijara, en osiep machiegni ahinya mar Gavana Ali Korane.

The Frenchman, whose pace-notes will be called out by compatriot Julien Ingrassia is hungry for an eighth title which he wants to accomplish in a Yaris brand.	Japiemno ma wuok e piny Ufaransa biro riembo kanyachiel gi Julien Ingrassia kendo odwaro ni ma obed lochne mar aboro kotiyo gi nying kambi mar Yaris.
"""The Toyota Yaris is a car for the super-boys, it's a masterpiece of Japanese engineering,” WRC Safari Rally CEO Phineas Kimathi noted when the machine, to be steered by Ogier at the gruelling Safari, was unveiled in Kenya last week."	"Jatend WRC Safari Rally nowacho kama chieng' ma ne otang' ne Jo-Kenya gari ma Ogier ne dhi piemgo, ""Toyota Yaris en gari makende ma iriembo mana gi chwo motegno ahinya, en masin molos majaber gi Jo-Japan."""
To make his intention known, Ogier has already won two legs of the 2021 WRC; the Rallye Monte Carlo and the Croatia Rally.	Mondo onere ni Ogier dwaro ahinya locho e piem midh tim Kenya, ne oselocho e piem ariyo mane ochakgo 2021 WRC ma gin Rally Monte Carlo kod Croatia Rally.
Ogier is also out for an eighth WRC Driver's Championship title following his victories in the category in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2020.	Mae dhi bedo locho mar aboro e piem mag WRC nikech nolocho e piem manotim 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 kod 2020.

Other drivers in the star-studded Toyota mix are Elfyin Evans of Wales to be navigated by Scott Martin of the United Kingdom, Kalle Rovanpera of Finland to be assisted by compatriot Jonne Halttunen and Katsuta Takamoto of Japan who will be guided by Dan Barritt of Great Britain behind the wheel.

Rovanpera is son of Hari Rovanpera, who finished second in the last WRC Safari in 2002.	Rovanpera en wuod Hari Rovanpera mane obed namba ariyo e piem mogik mar WRC Safari e higa mar 2002.
The Toyota lineup comes just days after South Korean manufacturer Hyundai announced their list for the Safari.	Tim mar Toyota ne olos mana ndalo machuok bang' ka kambi mawuok South Korea miluongo ni Hyundai lando list margi mar joma dhi piem e Safari.
The Hyundai Shell Mobis World Rally Team (i20) will be spearheaded by Estonian speed merchant Tanak.	Tim mar Hyundai Shell Mobis World Rally (i20) ibiro ta gi dereba mawuok Estonia miluongo ni Tanak.
Tanak, who won his WRC maiden title in 2019 has gone toe to toe with Ogier this season.	Tanak ema noyombo e piem mar WRC 2019 ka mano bedo lochne mokwongo to obiro dhi nyime piem gi Ogier higani.
He has already won the second leg of the 2021 WRC in Finland.	Bende, Tanak ema nolocho e tielo mar ariyo mar piem mar WRC 2021 e piny Finland.

Derepe mamoko manie tim mar Hyundai oriwo Thierry Neuville mawuok Belgium to ibiro konye gi Martijn Wydaeghe, kod Dani Sordo mawuok Spain to en ibiro konye riembo gi Borja Rozada.
Rally purists believe the rocky Sleeping Warrior stage in Naivasha will determine who goes home with the Safari title.	Johera mag piem mag geche wacho ni stej mopong'ga gi kite kama iluongo ni Sleeping Warrior, Naivasha, ema biro fwenyo ng'at madhi locho.
From the ARC championship held at the venue last month, it was evident that anyone who wanted to conquer the tough, muddy, rocky terrains needed considerable time to focus before launching the ferocious attack like a lion.

Arguably, many local fans will throw their weight behind Ogier since Kenya is a Toyota nation, owing to the availability of the brand spare parts.	Thoth Jo-Kenya oketo geno kuom Ogier nikech Kenya en piny mopong' gi geche Toyota kendo gige geche gechego yudore mayot e dukni.
Local drivers including Carl Tundo, Onkar Rai, Tejveer Rai and Karan Patel are expected to give the global drivers a run for their money if not the bragging rights.

Why climate action is at the heart of Eldoret City Marathon	Gimomiyo itimo kinda mar bero kor lwasi sama Eldoret City Marathon timore
When at least 600 athletes line up at the third edition of Eldoret City Marathon on Sunday, one race, which is tree planting will be climaxing.	Sama jong'wech 600 ikore ne tielo mar adek Eldoret City Marathon chieng' Jumapil, nitie ng'wech machielo ma be ochopo e ng'iende ma en pidho yiende.
Since the inaugural edition in 2018, the race has lived to its Climate Action theme.	Chakre ng'wejno bedie 2018, gisemakore ahinya gi temo bero kor lwasi.
This year alone, three million tree seedlings are expected to be planted prior to and after the race, in areas around Eldoret, the athletics town christened the ‘The City of Champions’ because a majority of world-beaters live and train there.	E higani kende, yiende matindo milion adek igeno ni idhi pidh ka pok ng'wech ochakore kod bang' ng'wech e alwora mar Eldoret, ma en taon ma jong'weny luongo ni 'Taond Joloch' nikech thoth joma osegalocho e piem mar ng'wech moriwo piny ngima odak kendo tiegore kuno.
But why Climate Action?	Ang'o momiyo gijiwo wach bero kor lwasi?
The Local Organising Committee (LOC) says the millions of trees will be planted in areas where athletes train increasing oxygen supply, a key component in running.	Komiti machano tijno miluongo ni Local Organising Committee (LOC) wacho ni gibiro pidho yiende mang'eny ahinya e alwora ma jong'wech tiegore mondo omed muya mar oxygen ma en gima dwarore ahinya sama ng'ato ringo.
LOC chairman Andrew Chelogoi said the tree planting events are aimed at sustaining fresh air in Eldoret town in areas near major training bases.	Jakom mar LOC, Andrew Chelogoi, nowacho gitimoga nyasi majiwo pidho yiende mondo muya maler obedie Eldoret  e alwora madongo ma ji tiegorega.
Chelogoi said for the last three years, the race’s management, with support from its key sponsors, has consistently sustained the Climate Action theme.	Chelogoi nowacho ni kuom higni adek mosekalo, jogo matayo ng'weye mitimo osebedo ka bero kor lwasi kikonyogi gi jogo mochiwore miyogi pesa.
“It is not only about the race. Our athletes should train in conserved environments and Eldoret City Marathon is aiming at planting three million trees this year alone,” the LOC chairman said.	"Jakom mar LOC nowacho kama, ""Ng'wejni en aena ringo kende. Jong'wech onego otiegre e alwora morit maber kendo Eldoret City Marathon chano mar pidho yiende milion adek e higani kende."""
Last year, the race was cancelled but was marked by tree planting at Kapseret forest, which is one of the key training bases in Uasin Gishu.	Higa mokalo, piem mag ng'wech ne ok otimore kata kamano, ne opidh yiende mang'eny e bungu mar Kapseret ma en achiel kuom kar tiegruok madongo Uasin Gishu.
Kaptagat, Burnt Forest, Kipchoge Keino Stadium, Moi University grounds and the University of Eldoret are among key training areas in the town where the country’s athletes train.	Moko kuom kuonde madongo ma jong'weny dhiga tiegore ringo gin Kaptagat, Burnt Forest, Kipchoge Keino Stadium, pewe mag Moi Yunivasiti kod Yunivasiti mar Eldoret.
The neighbouring counties of Elgeyo Marakwet and Nandi are known for producing the finest talents.	Moko kuom jong'wech mang'ula wuokga e kaonti mokiewo gi Eldoret ma gin Elgeyo Marakwet kod Nandi.
Retired athlete Daniel Komen told Standard Sport in a recent interview that training in Eldoret and other towns was becoming a health risk thanks to pollution.	Daniel Komen ma chon ne en-ga jang'wech, nonyiso gaset mar The Standard ni tiegruok Eldoret kod taonde mamoko ne chako hinyo ngimagi nikech alwora okethore.
“I urge athletes to train in areas away from town. It is risky to train in places with polluted air,” he warned.	"Nowacho kama, ""Akwayo jong'wech ni gidhi gitiegre mabor gi taon. Ok ber tiegruok kama muya mantie ok ler."""
Uasin Gishu Kenya Forest Service ecosystem conservator Thomas Kiptoo said at least one million trees will be planted on Saturday, just hours to the race.	Thomas Kiptoo ma en ofisa mochung'ne rito bunge e Uasin Gishu nowacho ni ibiro pidh yiende milion achiel chieng' Ngeso mana kodong' seche matin to ng'wech chakore.
“The one million trees will be planted in all streets of Eldoret town on Saturday as part of the official opening ceremony of the marathon,” Kiptoo said.	"Kiptoo nowacho niya, ""Ibiro pidh yiende milion achiel e nderni duto mag Eldoret chieng' Ngeso mondo mano ema obedo kaka gima yawo pap ne ng'wech mar marathon."""
On Saturday, as preparations for the race entered the home stretch and as focus shifted to management of crowds at the finish line, Joseph Chemuren, representing Athletics Kenya in the LOC said Anti-Doping of Kenya (ADAK) officials will play a central role in the race.	Chieng' Ngeso ka ne ji ikore ne piem mag ng'wech kendo nigoyo kwano kaka ibiro geng' oganda ma ne dhi chokore e kar tol mitiekogo, Joseph Chemuren mochung'ne Jong'wech mag Kenya manie LOC, nowacho ni jomatiyo gi Anti-Doping of Kenya (ADAK) biro mako kama duong' ahinya sama ng'wech dhi nyime.
Chemuren said open grounds at the TAC Centre, near the finish line, will be utilised for the VIP podium, athletes resting area and as space for race officials whose services will not be necessary at the finish line.	Chemuren nowacho ni pap mantie TAC Centre, machiegni gi kama itieko ng'wech, ema ibiro ketie kama welo modhial (VIP) betie, kanyoero be ema jong'wech biro yueyoe kendo be obiro bedo kama jotich betie ma tijgi ok dwarre e tol kama itiekogo ng'wech.

No soul under the sun can match –with precision and class –the hard work and determination Amos Kipruto summoned to excel in marathons.	Amos Kipruto nomimo kinda ahinya moloyo ng'ato ang'ato to mano emomiyo notimo maber e marathon.
Kipruto, the world marathon bronze medalist, is not your typical Kenyan athlete.	Kipruto ma ne oloyo mich mar okombe molos gi mula opogore gi Jo-Kenya mamoko ma jong'wech.
From childhood, Kipruto nursed lofty dreams: to stage excellent shows in athletics. And it has come to pass.	Chakre tinne, Kipruto osebedo ka gombo timo gik madongo kaka locho e piem mag ng'wech to koro lek mareno osechopo.
Kipruto, who put on hold his athletics desires to concentrate on academics, seems to follow in the counsel of American author Les Brown who once said: “Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss it, you will still land among the stars.”	Kipruto ne oweyo ringo mondo oket pache e somo, to nenore ni oluwo gima jandiko moro mawuok Amerka nowacho niya, 'Dwachi onego bed chopo e dwe, mondo kata ka bed ni mano ok onyalore to pod ibedo ni ichopo e sulwe mamoko.'
The 2016 Rome Marathon winner still draws inspiration from former world marathon record holder Paul Tergat.	Jang'wejno mane oyombo e ng'wech mar marathon manotim Rome, 2016, ohero luwo ranyisi mar jaloch machon mar marathon e piny, Paul Tergat.

He said he picked his running skills from Tergat and former Olympic marathon champion, the late Samuel Wanjiru.	Owacho ni nopuonjore ringo kuom Tergat kod jaloch machon mar marathon e piem mag Olimpik, mosenindo Samuel Wanjiru.
The 28-year-old athlete said he watches their clips online especially ahead of major races.	Jang'wechno ma jahigni 28 wacho ni orangago vidio mag jong'wech machon-go kapok odhi e piem madongo mag ng'wech.
“I love their fighting spirit especially in the final stages of races. They produced unexpected victories. In most cases, I watch their clips to pick some tactical skills,” said Kipruto, a runner up at the 2018 Berlin Marathon.	"Kipruto wacho kama, ""Ahero kaka gikedo matek e kare mogik mar ng'wech. Ne gilocho e yo ma ji ne ok par ni nyalore. Kinde mang'eny, ajarango vidio maggi mondo ayudo puonj moko mabeyo manyalo konya locho."""
His memorable clip is that of Wanjiru battling Ethiopia’s Tsegaye Kabede at the 2010 Chicago Marathon.	"Vidio mohero ahinya neno en ma Wanjiru piem gi Jang'wech mawuok Ethiopia, Tsegaye Kabede e ng'wech mar marathon ma ne otim Chicago."""
“In that clip, Wanjiru was behind at 35km to 40km but he produced a powerful kick in the last two kilometres.  It clearly shows that while competing in a marathon, you must have courage and stamina to run faster than expected,” he said.	"Owacho kama, ""E vidiono, Wanjiru ne chien e kilomita manie kind 35 nyaka 40, kata kamano, ne oringo matek ka ne odong' kilomita ariyo mogik. Mano nyiso ni sama ng'ato piem e marathon, nyaka ibed gi chir kod teko mar ringo matek moloyo kaka ji paro."""
Positive lessons he learned from the late Sammy Wanjiru, former Olympic marathon winner.	Weche mabeyo mane opuonjore kuom Sammy Wanjiru, ma ne en jaloch machon mar marathon e piem mag Olimpik.
While I was a young boy, Kipruto said he used to compete in inter-school games lining up in 5000m. 	E kinde ma pod ne an rawera matin, Kipruto ne japiem e tuke moriwo skunde koringo e ng'weye mag 5000m.
“By then, the late Sammy Wanjiru was at the top level. I loved watching him compete. His videos are being watched by many people up to now. His running style was wonderful. And luckily, the coach who trained him is now my coach,” he said.	"Owacho ni, ""E kindeno, Sammy Wanjiru ne piem e ng'wech madongo. Nahero neno kaka oringo. E kindegi be pod ji mang'eny neno vidio meke.Yo ma ne oringogo ne ber ahinya. To gimamora en ni ng'at ma ne otiege ema tiega sani."""
Kipruto, who finished second when Eliud Kipchoge set the world marathon record at the 2018 Berlin Marathon, said his training runs smoothly.	Kipruto, ma ne obet namba ariyo e kinde ma ne Eliud Kipchoge ofunjo rekod manyien marathon ma Berlin 2018, wacho ni tiegruok mare dhi nyime e yo maber.
“My body is responding well. I am ready for the Olympic Games. I started preparing it in April and all has been well.	"Nowacho niya, ""Denda dhi maber. Aikora ne tuke mag Olimpik. Nachako tiego denda e dwe mar April kendo weche dhi maber."
“My coach and my management follow every step I make in my training. I am under no pressure at the moment. I decided to put training a priority first and then plan for the race day. Preparations will determine the results.	Jal ma tiega kod jomataya luwo okang' moro amora ma agoyo e tiegruok. Onge luoro ma an-go sani.

Mercy Cherono gears up to make a strong return	Mercy Cherono ikore duogo e ng'wech

The 29-year-old, who finished fourth at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games in the 5000m event behind her compatriots – gold medalist Vivian Cheruiyot and Hellen Obiri, and Ethiopian Almaz Ayana – will battle for the prized ticket to the Olympic Games that run in Tokyo, Japan, from July 23 to August 8.

“After the Rio Olympics, I had a frightening foot fracture that made me miss out on the 2017 and 2018 seasons. I had to lay back from competitions and I decided to start a family and in the process, I had a baby girl,” Cherono said. “Immediately after the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak last year, I retreated back and continue training.	"Cherono nowacho kama, ""Bang' tuke mag Rio Olimpik, tienda ne ong'ikore to mano ne omiyo ok aringo e tuke ma 2017 kod 2018. Ne koro ne ok apiem, ne adwaro bedo gi joot kendo nanyuolo nyathi manyako.

"She added: “We are now training well and our focus is on the national trials. Training at home in Kericho and Kapsabet is good for me.

But her beautiful looks and the latest hairdo will no doubt make a statement about her off-the-track lifestyle, just as she did when she won 5000m gold at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland – without much fuss.	Kata kamano, kaka sani en nyako majaber kod kaka okado yie wiye biro nyiso maonge kiawa kaka osebudho ne ngima mar jong'wech-kuom ranyisi kaka nochalo ka ne oloyo mich mar okombe mar dhahabu e ng'wej 5000m e tuke mag Commonwealth mane otim Glasgow, Scotland.

She is gorgeous in her running kit and absolutely stunning in an evening gown!	Lepe mag ng'wech ondise kendo ojaber moloyo sama orwako lewni mag dhi e wuoth!
When she threw down the gauntlet to the Commonwealth nations’ participants, one point came out clearly inside Hampden Park in Glasgow: the world’s male sporting enthusiasts cooed with envy as the beauty queen headed to the start line.

Weightlifting: Kenyans Langat and Oduor strike silver as Achieng bags bronze	Ting'o Chuma: Langat kod Oduor ma gin Jo-Kenya obedo namba ariyo Achieng' obedo namba adek e piem
Triple Africa silver medallist Winny Langat (women 59kg) and new entrant Janet Oduor (45kg) bagged silver medals at the Africa Weightlifting Championships cum Olympic qualifiers in Nairobi last evening. 	Winny Langat (mine ma ting'o kilo 59) ma osebedo namba ariyo nyadidek kaachiel kod Janet Oduor (kilo 45) ne obedo namba ariyo e piem mag Africa Weightlifting Championships ma itimo Nairobi kiyierogo joma biro dhi e Olimpik.

The category was won by Ben Hnia of Tunisia who amassed 330 points.	Ng'ama ne oyombo e kidienyno en Ben Hnia ma wuok Tunisia ma noyudo alama 330.
At the same time, Africa Zone Two champion Wilkister Nadzuwah Nyiro will be in action this afternoon in the women 76kg.	Kawuono godiechieng, Wilkister Nadzuwah Nyiro biro piem ting'o kilo 76. Oselocho nyadiriyo e Afrika.
She longs to improve her Clean and Jerk personal best that currently stands at 82kg.	Ogombo ahinya kalo rekod mare mar ting'o miket e gok kilo 82.
Her personal best in Snatch is 70kg. “I am ready for the competition, it’s now or never. I want another gold,” she said. Nyiro has been training at Alpha Fit Gym in Nairobi and in Kitengela since returning from the 2019 African Games in Morocco where she finished seventh overall.	"Rekod mare e yudho chuma en kilo 70.

She believes she stands a great chance in the ongoing qualifier owing to the fact that she has been conducting her exercises under supervision of five weightlifting coaches and three others for strength and body conditioning.

No pressure for AFC Leopards coach Patrick Aussems ahead of Mathare United fixture	Koch mar AFC Leopards, Patrick Aussems ok oluoro tugo mochomogi gi Mathare United
AFC Leopards coach Patrick Aussems has urged his charges to remain focused as he aims to help the club end its 22-year Premier League title drought.	Koch mar AFC Leopards, Patrick Aussems dhi nyime timo kar monyalo mondo okony tim mare yudo okombe ma osetamgi yudo kuom higni 22.
According to the Belgian, he will not let anything block his vision, not even a temporary place at the top of the league standings for a day or two.	Kochno mawuok e piny Belgium ne owacho ni ok bi weyo mondo gimoro amora, kata mana loch ma gin-go sani ogeng' lek ma en godono mar loyo okombe.
Ingwe have a realistic chance of moving joint-top of the FKF Premier League table with KCB (36 points) today if they beat struggling Mathare United at Ruaraka Grounds.	Ingwe nowacho ni gin gi thuolo ma bedo namba achiel e list mar FKF Premier League kanyachiel gi KCB (ma nigi alama 36) ka giloyo tim mar Mathare United e tugo ma dhi timore e paw Ruaraka.
But Aussems has strongly cautioned against premature celebrations that might come with their temporary ascendency to the summit.	Aussems nosieme jotugo meke ni kik gibed mamor ahinya gi loch ma gin-go sani ma ketogi namba achiel kuom kinde.
A victory with a big margin (4 goals plus) at Ruaraka will see Ingwe lead the table for the first time in many months.	Ka tim mar Ingwe olocho mabor (gi gonde 4 kod mamoko) Ruaraka to ginyalo siko ka gin namba achiel kuom dweche mogwaro
However, the former Simba SC coach wants Ingwe players and fans to stick their eyes on the big prize which is to win the elusive title at the end of the season.	Kata kamano, koch machon mar Simba SC dwaro ni jotugo mag Ingwe ochom wang'gi kuom mich maduong' mondo omi gibi gilo okombe e giko tuke ma higani.
“If we win on Thursday, then we will be at the top, but (being at the) top is not important right now,” Aussems said after his side was held to a barren draw by Posta Rangers last weekend.	"Bang' wuok mar marom e tugo gi Posta Rangers juma mokalo, Aussems nowacho kama, ""Ka walocho e tugo ma dhi timore Tich Ang'wen, wabiro bedo namba achiel. Kata kamano, bedo namba achiel ok e gima duong' sani."""
And even as Aussems lamented poor officiating and the state of the pitch for their stalemate against the mailmen, he knows this is equally an important game for Mathare United, who are coming off a 2-2 draw with Nzoia Sugar.	Aussems noywagore ni noyaw tugo e yo ok ber to be pap mane gigoche gi Posta Rangers ne olos maber, kata kamano, ong'eyo ni Jo-Mathare United bende okawo mapek tugo ma gidhi bedogo bang wuok marom gi tim mar Nzoia Sugar (2-2).
But he believes their one game in hand gives them a chance to continue piling pressure on the leading pack as the race for the CAF Champions League qualification hots up.	Kata kamano, en gi yie ni tuko achiel ma gidong'go biro miyogi thuolo mar yudo alama momedore mamiyo gidong' namba achiel sama piem mag CAF Champions League dhi ka tedore.
Leopards are currently third on the log with 33 points, two behind second-placed Tusker.	Tim mar Leopards ema sani en namba adek gi alama 33 to giluwo bang' Tusker ma nigi alama 35.
On the other hand, Mathare, who recently acquired the services of former Harambee Stars assistant coach Frank Ouna, are rooted at the bottom of the table with a paltry eight points.	To komachielo, tim mar Mathare, ma nyocha oyudo jokony koch machon mar Harambee Stars, Frank Ouna, oywa goro gi alama aboro kende.
“Pressure is for the bears and wolves, so that’s not a problem. We still have one game remaining and if we win, we will be at the top. I know at the end of June there will be something special but after that, the league will finish in August,” said Aussems.	"Aussems nowacho niya, ""Dubu gi ondiegi ema weche oridorenegi, omiyo wan wachno ok chandwa. Pod wadong' gi tugo achiel, to ka walocho wadhi dong' namba achiel. Ang'eyo ni nitie gima kende ma dhi timore giko dwe mar Jun, kata kamano lig biro rumo e dwe mar Agost."""
“You need to know that we played 10 against 15 today (Saturday). Eleven players from Posta, the pitch and the three referees. I don’t like talking about the referees, but everything was against us. We need to have a good recovery because on Thursday we will be back in action, but I hope not on this pitch again.”	"Omedo niya, ""Onego ung'e ni wan gi jotugo 10 to joma ne wagochogo kawuono (Ngeso) ne nigi 15.

Coming from a community predominantly known for its athletics prowess, Fifa assistant referee Gilbert Cheruiyot wants to conquer greater heights in football.	Kata obedo ni owuok e oganda mong'ere ne ng'wech, Gilbert Cheruiyot ma en refari makonyo e Fifa wacho ni odwaro goyo okang' e tuk opira.
Cheruiyot, who is a Fifa accredited referee, has worked his way up to become one of the most respected match officials in the continent.	Cheruiyot osetiyo matek ahinya mondo obed achiel kuom refari momi luor Afrika.
Born and raised in Lembus Kiptoim, in Baringo County, Cheruiyot had a dream of playing professional football during his childhood but lack of support seemed to have dimmed his desire.	Ne onyuole Lembus Kiptoim, e kaonti mar Baringo, kendo ne en gi lek mar tugo opira ka ne pod otin, kata kamano, nikech ne onge joma nosire gomboneno ne olal.
He chose football instead of athletics, going against the norm in his community, something that did not go down well with his parents who insisted he should focus on his education or try athletics.	Ne oyier tugo opira kar ng'wech, mopogore gi kaka jo ogandagi jatimoga, to mano ne omoro jonyuolne ma ne dwaro ni oket pache e somo kata e ng'wech.
“Coming from a community that likes athletics more than any other sport was one of the main challenges. My community considers playing football a waste of time. And I could receive a beating from my parents whenever they saw me play with my peers,” said Cheruiyot.	"Cheruiyot wacho kama, ""Pek maduong' ma ne aromogo ne wuok e oganda mohero ng'wech moloyo tugo moro amora machielo. Ogandawa neno tugo opira kaka ketho sa. Jonyuolna ne chwadaga ka ne atugo opira gi mbesena."""
But despite being reprimanded by his parent, Cheruiyot never gave up on football.	To kata obedo ni jonyuolne ne oyie kode, Cheruiyot ne odhi nyime tugo opira.
After his secondary school education, in 2006, he decided to go for a refereeing course.	Bang' tieko skul mar sekondar e higa mar 2006, ne odhi tiegore bedo refari.
Since making up his mind of being a referee in 2008, Cheruiyot has never looked backed, rising from officiating local village football tournaments, Division Leagues, FKF Nationwide league to being a common face in the Football Kenya Federation Premier League matches.	Chakre ong'ad ni odwaro bedo refari e higa mar 2008, Cheruiyot pok oywago ang'e modok chien. Nochako gi tuke mitimo e gweng', modhi e Division Leagues, FKF Nationwide League to tinde ojanenore ding'eny e tuke mag FKF Premier League.
“Since 2008, I have developed from the lowest ranks through to the Kenyan Premier league and Confederation of African Football (Caf) matches,” said Cheruiyot.	"Cheruiyot nowacho kama, ""Chakre 2008, asetimo dongruok kachako gi tuke matindo madhi e tuke mag KPL kod mag CAF."""
Seven years later, the 37-year-old official bust into continental limelight as he oversaw several matches in different parts of Africa and there’s no slowing down for the lanky official.	Higni abiriyo bang'e, refarino ma jahigni 37 humbe nochako landore ka ne ochako dhi e tuke mopogore opogore e pinje mag Afrika.
And as Kenyans eagerly await the Tokyo Olympics showdown scheduled to be held from July 23 to August 8 this year in Tokyo, Japan, to witness their athlete’s battle for medals, their eyes will also be trained on the football fields as Cheruiyot makes those vital calls along the touchline.	Sama Jo-Kenya rito mondo Olympics ochakre Tokyo tarik 23 Julai nyaka tarik 8 Agost higani, mondo gine kaka jong'wech piem e yudo mich, girito bende neno kaka Cheruiyot biro bedo refari sa mitugo opira.
According to Cheruiyot, one of the challenges referees face mostly is language barrier.	Cheruiyot wacho ni achiel kuom pek madongo ma giyudo kaka refari en romo gi jotugo ma wacho dhok mopogore kodgi.
Cheruiyot and Mary Njoroge are part of the 99 officials selected by Fifa from 51 countries to officiate at the Olympic Games.	Cheruiyot kod Mary Njoroge gin moko kuom ji 99 moyier gi Fifa e pinje 51 mondo oyaw tuke mag Olimpik.
They will be in charge during the men and women’s football matches at the world games.	Gin ema gibiro tayo tuke opira mag mon kod chwo e tuke moriwo pinje.
Fifa appointed 25 centre referees, 50 assistant referees, 20 VAR officials and four support referees.	Fifa noyiero refari 25, jokony mag refari 50, afisa mag VAR 20 kod refari ma kojolo ang'wen.
Cheruiyot, who officiated at the Caf Confederation Cup between Orlando Pirates of South Africa and Raja Casablanca of Morrocco in south Africa on Sunday, said he feels honoured to be among the match officials selected for the Summer Games.	Cheruiyot ma ne omoko tuke mag Caf Confederation Cup e kind Orlando Pirates mar piny South Africa kod Raja Casablanca e piny Morrocco chieng' Jumapil ne owacho ni omor ahinya ni oyiere ne tuke madhi timorego.
“I don’t take this for granted; it is a big honour for me and the country. Out of the many referees, I am among the selected few,” he said.	"Nowacho kama, ""Ma ok en gima akawo mayot, en gima kende kuom kod ne pinywa. An achiel kuom refari manok moyier e kind refari mang'eny mantie."""
Cheruiyot, who was named the most improved assistant referee by Kenya Premier League in 2018, credits his refereeing journey to hard work and resilience.	Cheruiyot ma ne owach gi Kenya Premier League ni e jakony refari ma osetimo dongruok malach e higa mar 2018, wacho ni gima osekonye bedo refari maber en tiyo matek kod sinani.
“The climax in refereeing is being at the World Cup; it is every referee’s dream to officiate at that top level. Olympics is second after World Cup,” he said.	"Nowacho kama, ""Tij refari ma nigi nyadhi mogik en sa World Cup. Refari diuto nigi lek mar chopo e World Cup. Olimpik en namba ariyo bang' World Cup."""
Cheruiyot began his continental journey in 2015 when he officiated at the Caf Under-17 tournament in Niger before heading to Rwanda the following year for the 2016 Africa Nations Championships (CHAN).	Cheruiyot ne ochako tije moriwo pinje e higa mar 2015 kane oyawo tugo mr Caf Under-17 e piny Niger kae bang'e odhi Rwanda higa mane oluwo ne tugo mar 2016 Africa Nations Championships (CHAN).
In 2017, he was among the match officials who officiated the CAF Under-20 tournament in Zambia.	E higa mar 2017, en achiel kuom joma ne otayo tugo mar CAF Under-20 e piny Zambia.
Cheruiyot said one of the challenges referees face mostly is language barrier.	Cheruiyot nowacho ni achiel kuom pek madongo ma giyudo kaka refari en romo gi jotugo ma wacho dhok mopogore kodgi.
“When officiating especially international matches you normally meet with players and officials speaking different languages, you speaking English, players speaking Arabic others speak French, but we normally say refereeing is a universal language, when you blow the whistle or raise the flag the players should just follow instructions”, he said.	"Owacho kama, ""Sama in e tuke moriwo pinje iromo gi jotugo kod jomatayo mawacho dhok mopogore, iwacho Kisungu to jotugo wacho Dho-Arab, moko wacho French. Kata kamano, wawachoga ni rifari wacho dhok moriwo ji te nikech sama ikudho frimbi kata ting'o bendera malo, jotugo biro ng'eyo gima iwacho."""

After the final whistle, a section of Gor Mahia players confronted the referee, leading to a short but ugly scene.	Ka ne tugo orumo, jotugo moko mag Gor Mahia ne omonjo refari ma gigoye.
In a ruling by the CAF Disciplinary Committee, Oluoch and Muguna have each been handed Sh1.6 fine in addition to four-match bans.	Komiti machiwo Kum e CAF ne ogoyo Oluoch gi Muguna fain mar milion 1.6 kendo otamgi tugo opira e tuke ang'wen.

KCB capitalised on Tusker and AFC Leopards slip up to go on top of the FKF Premier League table after thrashing Bandari 3-0 at Utalii Grounds yesterday.	Nikech Tusker kod AFC Leopards ne ok otimo maber, KCB oidho ngas e FKF Premier League bang' loyo tim mar Bandari adek kuom ling' thi e pap mar Utalii nyoro.
Having watched Tusker and AFC Leopards drop two points each following their draws with Wazito (1-1) and Posta Rangers (0-0) respectively, the bankers needed a win to dislodge the brewers from the summit.	Tusker ne olalo alama ariyo kane oyudo gol marom gi Wazito (1-1), AFC Leopard be ne olalo alama ariyo bang' wuok hach hach gi Posta Rangers (0-0), omiyo ne dwarore ni KCB olo tugo achiel mondo gigol timbe mamoko e namba ma gin-go e lig.
And they did that in style with David Simiyu, Harun Thomas and substitute Derrick Otanga’s goals helping the bankers avenge last season’s double loss against the dockers and consequently return to the top of the table.	KCB ne olocho ma gibedo namba achiel e lig ka ne giyudo gonde adek moa kuom David Simiyu, Harun Thomas kod Derrick Otanga ma ne omi sab.
The emphatic victory saw Zedekiah ‘Zico’ Otieno’s boys take their points tally to 36, one ahead of Tusker and three more than third placed AFC as the race for CAF Champions League qualification hots up.	Loch ma ne giyudono ne omiyo jotugo mag Zedekiah 'Zico' Otieno obedo gi alama 36, ma ohingo mag Tusker gi achiel to ohingo alama mag AFC ma en namba adek sama weche tedore ka ji ikore ni CAF Champions League.
Though Otieno was pleased with his side’s performance, he played down their chances of securing their maiden Champions League ticket this season.	Kata obedo ni Oteno ne mor gi kaka tugo nobet, ne ok gikawo thuolo ma ne gin-go mar dhi hango tugo e Champions League.
“Even though we are focused on our next game against Sofapaka, it is our hope and prayer that we maintain the position until June 30. We are just taking one game at a time,” said Otieno.	"Otieno nowacho niya, ""Kata obedo ni sani waikore ni tugo mochomowa gi Sofapaka, walemo kendo wageno ni ok wabi wuok e namba ma wantie nyaka Jun 30. Wadwaro ni walo tugo achiel achiel ka wasudo."
“I’m satisfied with the result and proud of my players’ performance today. We stepped up against Bandari after a slow start in the Mathare United game. Winning 3-0 against a team of Bandari calibre at this point of league means we are a good team. The players know what’s at stake and I feel that’s a sweet revenge after Bandari took six points from us last season.”	"Amor ahinya gi kaka jotuga maga ne otugo kawuono.

It took only 15 minutes for David Simiyu to break the deadlock when he capitalised on the dockers’ defensive error to easily tap home Reagan Otieno’s delivery from the left flank before Henry Onyango missed a golden chance in the 21st minute.	David Simiyu ne oloyo gol mokwongo mana bang' dakika 15 ka ne oneno ka Jo Bandari ok ogeng'o gol margi mogweyo opira matek gi kama Reagan Otieno ne nitie gi koracham bende Henry Onyango ne olalo thuolo makende ahinya e dakika mar 21.
But five minutes later, Thomas Harun beat goalkeeper Justin Ndikumana from close range after the visitors’ defence failed to clear David Owino’s free kick.	Kata kamano, bang' dakika abich, Thomas Harun ne oloyo golkipa Justin Ndikumana ka ne Jo Bandari ok ogeng'o opira ma ne omi David Owino thuolo mar free kick.
Simiyu nearly bagged his second goal of the day when he pounced on a loose ball in the area only for the former Vihiga United man to feebly shoot straight at Bandari goalkeeper.	Simiyu ne chiegni loyo gonde mar ariyo ka ne oyudo opira machiegni gi golkipa en mana ne ogweyo opir tir modhi ne golkipa mar Bandari.
Sensing danger, Bandari coach Cassa Mbungo made a tactical change bringing on striker Umar Kasumba for centre half Brian Otieno on the half hour mark.

“Gor Mahia’s management called me seeking help on accommodation, and because I was aware of their match against Congo Boys, that was to give our coast boys the much-needed exposure, I thought it was only fair to help Gor Mahia honour this match as one way of supporting sports in this country,” Shahbal said.

Jatugo ma ma a German-no ma Chelsea notiyo gi pes mathoth nyiewo, a opie seche ma notugo to noringo matek mi okalo  jarit gol Ederson kae to opiko opira e gol ma koro nodong' nono e dakika mar 42 ka mano miyo tugo ma iye notuereno kendo ma none gi ji 16,500 mobet e e pap orumo gi gondno.
Premier League champions City were favourites ahead of the final but suffered a desperately disappointing night in their first Champions League showpiece match.	Tim mar City ma be e ma oloyo okombe mar Premier League champions e ma ne nenore ni nyalo locho ka pok tugo ma ne gitugie maberno ochakore maka mana ni nokuod wigi gi tukgi mar fainol mokwongo e laro okomber mar Champions League.
Despite winning three of the last four Premier League titles for City, Spaniard Guardiola failed to deliver the coveted European trophy he last won with Barcelona in 2011.	Kata obedo ni City oseloyo okombe Premier League adek e kind ang'en mosekalo, Guardiola ma a Spain ne ok omiyo timbe oloyo okombe moriwo timbe mag Europe ma timno osebedo ka gombo malich ka kinde mogik ma ne Guardiola oneno okombeno ne en higa mar 2011 kotiego tim mar Barcelona.
For Chelsea's German manager Thomas Tuchel the triumph comes after his Paris St Germain side suffered defeat in last season's final against Bayern Munich and just four months after he took over from Frank Lampard at the west London club.	Ne jatiek mar Chelsea Ja-German Thomas Tuchel loch biro bang' tim mar Paris St Germain nogo radar gi tim mar Bayern Munich e fainol mar e season mokalo. Olocho mana bang' dweche ang'wen bang' kawo telo kuom Frank Lampard e klab no ma imbo mar London.
"""To share it with everybody is incredible. We made it. Wow. I don't know what to feel,"" said Tuchel. ""I was so grateful to arrive a second time (in the final). I felt different."	"Tuchel nowacho kama: ""Mit ndi ni wan be wan gi okombeni. Walocho. Mayie. Akia kata kaka daler kaka awinjo. Amor ni achopo e fainol ariyo e piemni. Amor ma akia"""
The (players) were determined to win this. We wanted to be a stone in their (City's) shoe. 	Jotuka noramo ni nyaka gilochi. Ne wagombo ni wabed kidi e wuoch jo City.
We encouraged everybody to step up and step out, to be more brave.	Ne wajiwo ng'ato ka ng'ato kuomgi mondo othuthni matek.
While Tuchel got his approach spot on, Guardiola’s team selection was surprising with Raheem Sterling brought in on the left, neither regular holding midfielder, Fernandinho or Rodri, picked and Ilkay Gundogan left to protect the back line.	Kata obedo ni Tuchel nopango jotuke kaka ojatimo, Guardiola to notimo lokruoge moko kendo nodhiero ji kuom Raheem Sterling notugo e bath pap koracham, kendo ne ok oketo Fernandinho kata Rodri mondo otug e dier pap, mi ochweyo keto Ilkay Gundogan nodong' ka rito chien.
It quickly became apparent the move had left City’s defence exposed with Chelsea creating early chances, three of which fell to German Timo Werner who failed to capitalise - miskicking one, shooting softly at Ederson and then finding the side-netting.	Nonenore ayanga ni lokruogno nomiyo ne yot yoro jotuk City ma nodong' chien, to mano ne Chelsea mar temo loyo didhigra e tugono ne chakore ka mokwongo jatukgi ma Ja-German miluongo ni Timo Werner olalo thuolo mathoth mag locho ka mokwongo nofwayo boch, machielo ogoyo ne Ederson opira ma yom yom, to thuolo machielo ogoyo net mana gi bathe.
Gundogan’s already difficult task got harder when he was booked for a foul on Mason Mount in the 34th minute.	Tich matek ma Gundogan ne nigo nobedo ma ndwari moloyo bang' miye kad e dakika mar 34 nikech notugo ne Mason Mount e yo ma ok owinjore.
Chelsea also suffered a setback when their experienced Brazilian centre-back Thiago Silva went down awkwardly after a header and had to limp off six minutes before the break, being replaced by Andreas Christensen.	Chelsea be weche noridorenegi bang' jakutgi ma a Brazil miluongo ni Thiago Silva oruombore piny bang'  chikore malo kogoyo opira gi wiye to mano nochuno ni owuog kosuto kodong' mana dakika auchiel to gidhi e yueyo. Ne okaw kare gi Andreas Christensen.
However, three minutes later Chelsea struck. Midfielder Mount split the City defence with a superb through ball and Ederson rushed out of his goal but was unable to stop Havertz from skipping past him and slotting into the unguarded net.	Kata kamano, dakika adek bang' mano, Chelsea oyudo gol. Jatukgi ma diere miluongi ni Mount opisore gi opira e kind jotuk City ma chien to mano nomiyo Ederson owuok e dho gol kobiro mondo ores opira to Mount nodang'e mi odong' mana gi gol kendo nyumo opirano mayom.
City’s night got worse when key midfielder Kevin De Bruyne had to go off with a concussion injury after an accidental clash with Antonio Rudiger left him on the ground, with Guardiola throwing on Brazilian striker Gabriel Jesus in his place.	Weche nomedo bedo ndwari ne City bang' jatukgi ma diere Kevin De Bruyne rodhno gi Antonio Rudiger mi ohinyore mi odong' kombemore piny kendo mano nomiyo ogole e pap. Guardiola noketo Ja-Brazil Gabriel Jesus okaw kare.
Christian Pulisic came on for Chelsea to become the first American to play in a Champions League final and almost the first to score when he was slipped in by Havertz but then drifted his shot just wide of the post.	Christian Pulisic noduogo odonjo ne jo Chelsea ka mano miye thuolo mar bedo Ja-Amerka mokwongo tugo fainol e tuke Champions League kendo poth komedo ja pinyno mokwongo loyo e tugo ma kamano to Havertz nopoye mi ogoyo opira oko mar gol.
City gradually began to get the upper hand but their usual composure was lacking and it was not until deep into stoppage time that they went close with a hopeful effort from Riyad Mahrez that clipped the bar.	Weche nochako bedo maber ne City mosmos kata kamano, ne ok gitugo e yo ma gitugogago ka gipie
The final whistle set off wild celebrations for the Chelsea fans who had flown in for the game, while dejected City supporters headed off for the flights back to Manchester. 	Ka nogo firimbi mogik, joma pako timb Chelsea ma nobiro e tugono ne mor ma tamre gi nono ni gilocho, ka koni joma ne pako City chunygi a ojog kendo ne giwuok ka gichomo paw ndege mondo gidog Manchester korgi.
"""Decisions are always to try to win the game,"" said Guardiola, when asked to reflect on his team selection. "	"Ka nopenj Guardiolo gimomiyo noloko yo ma jotuke lochogo, nowacho kama: ""Kinde duto itimoga lokruok mana mondo tim olochi."""
"""I would like to say it was an exceptional season for us. Unfortunately we couldn’t win. We tried, but we couldn’t do it and will work harder from here,"" added the Spaniard, whose side won the League Cup to go with their Premier League crown."	"Nomedo wacho niya: ""Daher wacho ni ma ne en season ma ne ber kodwa ndi."
The way we played the game in the second half, they had one counter attack with Pulisic. 	Yo ma ne wagogo thuolo mar ariyo mar tugoni, ne gin gi counter attack achiel koa kuom Pulisic.
They’re a really good team, but we competed perfectly against them.	Gin tim ma tugo maber, to ne wapiem kodgi maber malich.
Tuchel has faced City three times in six weeks and won every time. Chelsea's Russian owner Roman Abramovich, watching from the stands, must have had a wry smile to himself as once again his ruthless approach to managerial changes has paid off. 	Tuchel oseromo gi City didek e thuolo mar jumbe auchiel kendo gisegoyo City didekgo te. Roman Abramovich ma a Russia kendo ma wuon tim mar Chelsea ni e kind ji ka timno tugo. Onge kiawa ni nowuoro awuoro kaka yo ma osebedogo kiwilo koch mage osekonyo timno.
In the second half we deserved to score one goal but we couldn’t do it.	E thuolo mar ariyo nonego walo gol mar ariyo to notamowa atama.
Football Kenya Federation (FKF) has announced the team that will be leading on the FKF Premier League standings by June 30 will represent Kenya in the 2021/22 CAF Champions League.

This is after a statement dated May 17, 2021, signed by FKF CEO, Barry Otieno required a name (representative) be submitted to CAF by Wednesday, June 30, 2021, which is the deadline for member associations to submit teams to its Interclub Competitions.

FKF says the decision to award the CAF Champions League spot to the team leading the league at the said date has been occasioned by the fact the league calendar (fixtures) will not have concluded.

The unavailability of Kasarani and Nyayo Stadiums is giving FKF Premier League bosses sleepless nights.	Bedo ni ok nyal ti gi pab Kasarani kod Nyayo Stadium baro wi jotend FKF Premier League malich.
Initially, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) had earmarked the two largest sporting facilities in the country as venues for the league which resumed on Friday (May 14) after almost a seven-week break.	Mokwongo okwongo Football Kenya Federation (FKF) nosechano tiyo gi pewe ariyo madongo e pacho kaego, kaka pewe ma idhi gochie ka tuke chakore Tich Abich Mei 14 bang' bedo e yueyo kuom jumbe ma dirom abiriyio.
But according to Sports Kenya Director General Pius Metto, Kasarani (Main and Annex) will be inaccessible for at least four months as it is being used as a bubble camp for Team Kenya preparing for the Tokyo Olympic Games.	To Kaluwore gi Pius Methho ma e director mar Sports Kenya Director General, Paw Kasarani (Pap maduong' kod machielo e bathe kanyo miluongo ni Annex) ok bi tigo kuom thuolo ma ok tinne dwech ang'wen nikech Team Kenya tiyo kodgi e timo ikruok ne tuke mag Tokyo Olympics Games.
Apart from acting as a bubble camp for the Olympic team whose first batch departs for Japan on July 5, Kasarani is scheduled to host the IAAF World U20 Championships on August 17-22.	Mopogore gi jotugo ma ikore ne Olympics ma bathgi mokwongo biro dhi Japan Julai 5, ichano ni ibiro ti gi paw Kasarani timo tuke mag IAAF World U20 Championships ma biro chakore Agost 17-22.
He further said that they are still in discussions with the Ministry of Sports on the availability of Nyayo Stadium.	Nodhi nyime wacho ni pod giwuoyo gi Migawo mar Tuke (Ministry of Sports) ka be inyalo ti gi pab Nyayo Stadium.
“Kasarani is locked for Olympics preparations. It is a bubble camp for Team Kenya and we are not allowing any other activities in the facility. In essence, the facility is inaccessible until after the World U20 Championships in August. That means, the FKF Premier League organisers will have to look for somewhere else to host their matches,” Metto told Standard Sports.	"Metto nonyiso Standard Sports niya: ""Kasarani ok nyal tigo sani nikech itiyo kode e ikruok ne piem mag Olympics. Team Kenya tiyo kode kendo ok wanyal yie mondo gimachielo odhi nyime kanyo. To chal ka gima pod ok nyal ti kode nyaka tuke mag World U20 Championships orum e dwe mar Agost. Ma e nyiso ni nochan FKF Primeier League biro manyo kamachielo mondo tukegi odhi nyime."""
"Asked about Nyayo’s availability, the official simply said: “I don’t want to comment about Nyayo Stadium because the facility was not supposed to host local games."""	"To ka nopenje ka be inyalo ti gi Nyayo Stadium, noko kama: ""Ok daher wuoyo e wi Nyayo Stadium nikech pabno ok onego otigo e goyo upiche ma pacho kae."""
But all the same we are still having a discussion with the Ministry and we will update them.	Kata kamano, pod wawuoyo gi Migawo mar Tuke kendo wabo nyisou kaka weche obet.

And that’s why I don’t want to comment further on the matter.	To mano e gimomiyo ok daher wuoyo e wi wachno.
And with the unavailability of the two largest sporting facilities in the country, the federation has been forced to relook for other alternative venues (Narok, World Hope, Utalii and Ruaraka Grounds) for Nairobi-based teams in this congested window that is set to conclude on July 14 two weeks after the deadline of submitting the league winners’ name to CAF (Champions League).	Bedo ni ok nyal ti gi pewe ariyo madongo e pacho kae, chuno ni riwruokno ochak manyo kuonde mamoko ma ginyalo tiyogo.

While FKF president Nick Mwendwa says they have no option but to continue playing, he feels the poor state of the venues that has been worsened by the rains will affect the quality of the game.	Kata obedo ni ker ma FKF Nick Mwendwa wacho ni onge kaka de gitim to nyaka tuke odhi mana nyime, oparo ni tukego ok bi bedo mong'ith ruok nikech pewe mitiyogo oketh gi koth ma dhi nyime chue.
“Football is under pressure after we were denied hosting the matches at Kasarani and Nyayo. We have been told none of the stadiums is available for us so we will have to make do with the venues we have,” said Mwendwa.	"Nowacho niya: ""Ka nosetuonwa tiyo gi pebe man Kasarani kod Nyayo Stadium, wach tuke mag adhula oridore malich. Nonyiswa ni ok wanyal tiyo gi pebe ariyogo, omiyo biro chunowa tiyo gi pebe ma wabiro yudo."""
“The other pitches will have a great impact on our game in terms of TV production and players’ output. It will be expensive to take the matches outside Nairobi.”	"Pebe mamokogo biro ng'uko rang'iny tukewa e yo ma jotugo biro tugogo ko ma inyisogigo e TV.

Kenyan legend Benjamin Ayimba was set to start an age grading rugby academy in Nyanza	Benjamin Ayimba ma omi luor ahinya e piny Kenya ne chano mar chako academy mar tugo rugby e alwora mar Nyanza.
As Kenyans are coming to terms with the sudden death of the former Kenya Sevens and rugby legend and coach Benjamin Ayimba, it has been revealed he had a great intention to build an age grading rugby academy in the Nyanza region.    	Seche ma Kenya pod odhier nono gi tho  Benjamin Ayimba ma chon ne tugo ne Kenya Sevens kendo koch mang'ula mar rugby, osenyeny e lela ni ne en gi gombo mar gero academy mar rugby ne joma tindo e gwenge mag Nyanza.
While revealing his (Ayimba) plans for Nyanza region in rugby development, Kenya Lionesses head coach Felix Oloo said the fallen hero had started engaging him to commence the inauguration of the academy that could tap talents at the grassroots from the home of rugby in Western Kenya.	Koch mar Kenya Lioness, Felix Oloo nowuoyo e wi gombo ma ne Ayimba nigono kowacho ni Ayimba nosechako sumo paro kuome mondo ochak tim mar joma tindo alwora mar Western kenya kendo mano ne nyalo miyo joma nigi talanta mar tugono oyudre kowuok e gwengego.
Oloo said Ayimba had the intention of having an academy in Western Kenya similar to the ones at Nakuru Athletic Club and Impala Club in Nairobi.	Oloo nowacho ni Ayimba ne gombo ni academy ma kamano obedie e alwora mar Western Kenya mana kaka Nakuru Athletic Club kod Impala Club ma ni  Nairobi nigi gima kamano.
“That was his aspiration and ambition soon after he retired from the national duties and we were to partner together in the whole process of having the matter come to fruition,” Oloo told The Standard Sports while mourning the fallen legend.  	"Nowuoyo gi The Standard Sports koywago Ayimba kendo kowacho niya: ""Mano e ma ne en gombo Ayimba bang' were gi ritaya e weche tuke ma pacho ka, kendo ne kendo nonego wariwre e timo kamano."""
“He was a real coach who faced issues head-on and had his own ways of solving matters within players that resulted in the playing unit playing for him,” Oloo who is a former Kenyan international said.	"Oloo ma bende kinde mokalo nogocho ne timb Kenya e pinje maoko nomedo wacho kama: ""Ne en koch maber ma ne rakore gi weche ka ok oluor, kendo ne en gi yore mag loso weche e kind jotuke ma ne miyo gitugone maber."""
As he leads Kenya Lionesses to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Oloo said he would like to emulate the fallen legend in his footsteps that led Kenya to win the first ever global sevens title in Singapore Sevens in 2016.

“He was my mentor and with my appointment at the national level, it is my desire to follow his footsteps to ensure the women’s team bags a global title under my armpit,” he stated.	"Ne owacho kama: ""Anene kaka ng'at moketona ranyisi maber monego aluw odamoge, to kaka sani ma oyiera mondo atiek timb pacho kae, en gombona atim kaka notimo ka akonyo timb wakeyni oyud mich milaro e piny ngima."""
Menengai Oilers head coach Gibson Weru said Ayimba elevated the sevens rugby from obscurity to the global level.	Koch mar Menengai Oilers, Gibson Weru nowacho ni Ayimba nomiyo tuk rugby ma pacho kae ong'ere e piny mangima.
He said he had the privilege to play alongside Ayimba at the national team at the global level before he later became his tactician years later.   	Nowacho ni noyudo thuolo mar tugo gi Ayimba ka gitugo ne tim ma pacho kae kinde ma ne gidhiga gocho gi timbe mag pinje mamoko, to higni moko bang'e Ayimba noidho ngas mobedo koch ma tiego tim ma ne entiere.

Ayimba (44) was battling cerebral malaria, which kept him away from the public eye since the start of 2021.	Ayimba ma notho ka jahigni 44 ne nigi tuwo maleria mager miluongo ni celebral malaria, kendo tuono nomiyo olal e wang' ji chakre chak 2021.

Ayimba was admitted to the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) Private Wing.	Ne oter Ayimba e Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) e kare ma Private Wing.
After leaving his brief role as Kenya 15's coach, Ayimba coached the Sevens team between 2006 and 2011, where they secured their first-ever World Series final in 2009 in Adelaide, Australia. In the same year, he led Shujaa to its maiden Rugby World Cup Sevens semi-final in Dubai.

E higa achielno, nochako okonyo tim mar Shujaa ohang ochop e semi fainol mar tuk Rugby World Cup Sevens  ma notim Dubai.
His second stint as Kenya Sevens head coach was between 2015-16, where he coached the team to its first-ever appearance at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.	Kinde mar ariyo ma nobedoe koch mar Kenya Sevens ne en e kind higa mar 2015-16 kendo nochwalo timno mi ochopo e Olympics ma 2016 ma notim Rio de Janeiro e piny Brazil, ka mano e kinde mokwongo ma timno nochopo e piemnoendo.
In 2016, Ayimba and the team made history when they won the World Series title after Kenya beat Fiji 30-7 in the 2016 Singapore Sevens final.	E higa mar 2016, Ayimba kod timno notimo gi ma pok notimorega nyaka nene ka ne giloyo okombe mar World Series bang' timb Kenya rodho timb  Fiji 30-7 e tuke fainal ma Singapore Sevens ma 2016.
Locally, he had coaching stints at Kenya Harlequins (Assistant coach), Mean Machine and Homeboyz.	E timbe ma tugo pacho kae, nojatiego Kenya Harlequins (ka en jalup coach), Mean Machine kod Homeboyz.
Ayimba will go down in history books as the man who won the 2016 Singapore Sevens after thrashing Fiji 30-7 to bring the coveted cup home.	Ayimba ibiro par e buge histori kaka jal ma noloyo okombe mar Singapore Sevens ma 2016 kuom rodho Fiji 30-7 to mano nomiyo okombe ma ji olap dhogi chuerneno odonjo e pacho kae.
It is no mean feat.	Mano gima tek timo.
But did you know that Ayimba’s rugby journey reads like that of the biblical Israelites when they left Egypt?	Be ing'eyo ni yo ma ne Ayimba otayogo tuke rugby inyalo pim gi yo ma Muma lerogo kaka Jo-Israel nowuokgo Misri?
Maybe not, as many Kenyans — save for his recent win in Singapore — remember him as a man who was fired as the Sevens coach in 2011.	Samoro ok ing'eyo mano. Gima Jo-Kenya mang'eny parogo Ayimba kiweyo lochne ma Singapore, en ni noteng' lwete mogo e higa mar 2011 koweyo bedo koch mar tim mar Sevens.
The former old boy of Olympic Primary School in Nairobi, according to one of his teachers, tried his hand (and legs) in anything sports.	Achiel koum jopuonj ma nopuonje nowacho ni Ayimba notemo tuke duto ma noriwo e nyime, kendo ne en nyathi skund Olympic Primary School man Nairobi.
After completing his studies at Olympic, Ayimba joined Maseno School in Nyanza, where he met a teacher, one Jeam Agutu, the then Deputy Principal at Maseno School.	Bang' tieko sombe Olympic, Ayimba nodhi Maseno School man Nyanza, kama noromoe gi japuonj miluongo ni Jeam Agutu ma e kindeno ne Deputy Principal ma Maseno School.
Ayimba had a polished demeanour and was easy to read.	Ayimbe ne en nyathi modimbore kendo ne yot fwenyo ni nodhi bedo ng'at maber.
He had the will and mettle to succeed against odds, traits he had built since his childhood days and later teenage years.	Ne en gi mijing'o kendo nochodore mar locho kata ang'o timre, ma gin kido ma ne en-go chakre tinne nyaka bang'e ka koro en rawera.
He received the all-important shot in the arm when Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) Chairman Richard Omwela reinstated him as coach to do what he loves and knows best. He did not disappoint as was evident in the Hong Kong and triumphant Singapore tours.	Ne en gi gik moko duto ma ne dwarore ka ne Richard Omwela ma ne en jakom mar Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) oduoke e tij bedo koch e tugo ma ne ohero kendo olonyie matek. Gima notimo Hong Kong kod loch ma ne giyudo Singapore nonyiso adier ni ong'eyo gima otimo.
During his days as a player, he had a winning mentality, especially after reaching similar finals in the late 1990s.	E kinde ma ne otugo, gima noketoga  e pache ne en locho, to ahinya ahinya ka ne ochopo e fainol ma kamago  e giko higni mag 1990.
The Kenyan rugby fraternity and the entire sporting world was in shock yesterday after Shujaa legend Benjamin Ayimba died of cerebral malaria on Friday night. He was 44.	Joma ohero tuke mag rugby e piny Kenya kaachiel kod jomamoko mohero weche tuke nyoro nobuok ahinya bang' winjo ni thuond Shujaa, Benjamin Ayimba tho okawo chieng' Tich Abich gotieno bang' bedo gi tuwo mar cerebral malaria kuom kinde. Notho kojahigni 44.
The news of Ayimba’s death, who was a national hero after establishing himself as one of the greatest rugby coaches in the country, brought an outpouring of mourning and remembrance on social media, headlining almost all the discussions.	Tho Ayimba, ma nothuthni mondo ong'ere  kaka koch mar rugby mosetimie maber mokalo e pacho kae, nomiyo ji dabal ochoro yuakgi ka gitiyo gi yor mbui (social media) ka mano en gima iwuoyie chiegni kamoro amora.
“Benjamin succumbed to the multiple complications he was being treated for over the past couple of months,” read a statement from family’s spokesman Oscar Osir.	"Ripod ma Oscar Osir, jal ma wuoyo e wi lo joodno, ne wacho kama: ""Weche ma korgi tek ma osebedo ka tuoyo Ayimba dweche matin mokalo, e ma onege."
The family and close friends would like to extend their deepest gratitude for the prayers and the overwhelming moral and financial support that you all have offered during Benjamin’s last days.	Joode kaachiel gi osiepe de her goyonu erokamano uduto ma usebedo kulemone kendo kusirogi gi jip kod omenda.
The former Kenya Sevens and fifteens captain’s legend grew into international reverence in 2016 when he masterminded Kenya’s Main Cup triumph at Singapore Sevens. 	Ayimba ma kinde mokalo nobedo kaptain mar Kenya Sevens kod Fifteens, ne humbe oduogo ong'ere e piny mangima e higa mar 2016 ka yo ma notiyogo nomiyo timbe olocho e laro okombe ma Singapore Sevens.
Shujaa pulled off a shocking 30-7 victory over Fiji to clinch their first ever World Sevens Series title on Ayimba’s second stint as the national team coach.	Shujaa nomako dho ji ka ne gidiemo Fiji aduwa (30-7) ka mano miyo piny Kenya loyo mich mar World Seven Series kinde mokwongo nyaka ne piny chakre. Mano notimore ka noduog Ayimba mondo obed koch mar timb pacho kae bang' ka noseriembe kinde mokalo.
And from President Uhuru Kenyatta to opposition leader Raila Odinga, Kenya Rugby Union chairman Oduor Gangla, Shujaa coach Innocent ‘Namcos’ Simiyu, captain Andrew Amonde and his former teacher cum rugby coach at Maseno School Milton Nyangaga, all described Ayimba as a true servant of the game.	Kochakore gi ker Uhuru Kenyatta nyaka jatend joma kwedo sirkal migosi Raila Odinga, kaachiel kod jakom Kenya Rugby Union Oduor Gangla, koch ma Shujaa Innocent 'Namcos' Simiyu, kaptein Andrew Amonde, kod japuonjne machon ma be notiege e tuke rugby e skund Maseno School Milton Nyangaga, jogi duto nowacho ni Ayimba nochodore ne tugono gadiera.
While paying tribute to his predecessor and former coach, who introduced him to international level, Simiyu urged the government to give Ayimba a state funeral.	Simiyu ma ne ochako tiego Shujaa bang' Ayimba kendo ma ne tugo e timb Ayimba, noyuage kojiwo sirkal ni oyike kaka iiko jotelo madongo e pacho kae.
“I’m saddened by the loss of Benja. He was a true rugby man who dedicated his life to the game. He was a national team player, a captain and a coach. It is a big loss not only to the rugby fraternity but the entire country,” Simiyu, who replaced Ayimba as Kenya 7s coach in 2016 told The Standard Sports.	"Simiyu ma ne ochako tiego Shujaa bang' Ayimba e higa mar 2016 nowuoyo gi Standard Sport kowacho kama: ""Litna ndi ni Benja otho. Nohero tuk rugby ahinya kendo nochodorega ne tugono. Ne en jatugo ma ne dhi tugoga oko mar pacho kae, ne en kaptain, kendo koch. Joher tuke rugby kod piny Kenya olalo ng'at maduong' miwuoro."
It is at this time that the government should come in and even give him a proper sendoff. 	Seche ma chal ka magi e ma sirkal onego ochiwre mondo oyik Ayimba e yo ma iikogo jotelo madongo ma pacho kae.
He actually deserves a state funeral or a sendoff that best befits him like someone who dedicated his whole life for Kenya. 	Kiwacho adier, mano e kit iko monego oikego, kata oike e yo ma nyiso ni nochiwore gi ngimane te tiyo ne Kenya.
He has been a true servant of the game.	Onge kiawa moro amoro ni nochodore ne tugoni.
President Uhuru Kenyatta excited after making a line out with the Kenyan 7s team at State House, shaking hands with the head coach Benjamin Ayimba in 2016.	Ker Uhuru Kenyatta mor bang' neno jotugo mag Kenya 7s kopangore e lain e State House kendo omosore gi koch Benjamin Ayimba e higa mar 2016.
"He continued: “I remember when I left High School and made it to the national team, Benja was the captain. He walked us through and introduced us to the international level."""	"Omedo kama, ""Aparo kaka bang' tieko skul sekondar ne ariwora gi tim mar piny, kendo Benja ema ne en kapten. Ne otiegowa kendo ne okonyowa chopo kama watugo gi pinje maoko."""
He was a very inspirational captain and even when he became the coach, I was his first captain.	Ne en kapten mong'eyo jiwo ji to ka ne obedo koch, an ema nabedo kapten mokwongo e bwoye.
We had a very good year in getting to the finals for the first time ever in Adelaide.	Higano ne watimo maber ahinya kendo ne wachopo e kidieny mogik mag tuke ma ne otim Adelaide.
He really mentored us to challenge the norm and renew our thinking and change our mindsets.	Ne okonyowa mondo kik watim gik moko kaka ji timo to kar mano wabed gi paro manyien.
There was that notion that we are the underdogs and that’s what he changed; we can compete with the big boys.	Ne nitie paro monya ni wan guogi mocha, to mano e paro ma noloko ka nomiyo wapiem gi jotugo madongo.
KRU chairman Oduor Gangla simply said: “A true servant of the game, Benjamin was an inspiration to many, on and off the pitch.”	"Jakom mar KRU, Oduor Gangla nowacho kama, ""Benjamin ne en jatugo madier, ne ojiwo ji e pap kod oko mar pap."""
But Ayimba also made friends and foes in equal measure with his perceived no nonsense approach and unflattering statements during his two coaching stints at Shujaa.	E kinde ariyo machuok ma Benjamin ne obedogo koch Shujaa, ne obedo gi osiepe kod joma kwede nikech ne ok ohero oyuma sa tugo.
Though Ayimba was portrayed as a coach who attracted both admiration and resentment in his line of duty winning himself love and loathe at the same time, Amonde considers him as a revolutionary.	Kata obedo ni Ayimba ne en koch jomoko ohero to jomoko be ne kwede, Amonde kwane kaka ng'at ma nokelo lokruok.
He clashed with KRU bosses in some occasions that mostly led to his sacking both in 2011 and 2016.	Nitie kinde ma ne ochwanyor gi jotend KRU to mano ne omiyo oriembe tich e higa mar 2011 kod 2016.
In 2011, Ayimba was fired after opposing the fielding of the team’s main players in the Safari Sevens tournament before he faced the same wrath in 2016 following the Rio Olympic Games fiasco.	E higa mar 2011, ne oriemb Ayimba tich bang' kwedo kaka nochan jotugo madongo e tim e tugo mar Safari Sevens tournament, to mano be e gima notimorene e higa mar 2016 bang' weche ma ne obagni e tuke Olimpiks ma ne otim Rio.
“Ayimba was a special person. He came through the Kenyan rugby system and he has been able to give us a road map that we will have to follow in the future. Ayimba did his part and showed us the way, and now it is up to us to make him proud in heaven. We are all mourning for having a legend gone too soon,” said Amonde.	"Amonde nowacho kama, ""Ayimba ne ng'at makende ahinya. Ne en jatuk rugby ne piny Kenya kendo oweyonwa ratiro ma nyisowa yo monego waluw e kinde mabiro. Ayimba ne otimo ma kore ma onyisowa yo, koro en ting'wa neno ni wamoro chunye ka en e polo. Waduto wakuyo ni ng'at maber otho ka ndalone podi."""
"""I feel Benja was more than a servant of the game. He gave it all. I think he is one mentor that has brought a different bit into the game. Rugby will forever remain indebted to Benja and his family because he brought us at a place where no one ever did and achieved a lot.” he addded."	"Odhi nyime wacho ni, ""Aparo ni Benja ne ok en aena jatugo. Ne ochiwo gike te ne tugo. Aparo ni en achiel kuom joma okelo lokruoge e tugo mar rugby. Jotugo mar rugby biro dhi nyime pare nyaka chieng' nikech ne omiyo gichopo kama onge ng'at ma ne osechope kodgi kendo ne otimo gik mang'eny mabeyo."""
Before the Singapore triumph, Ayimba had masterminded Kenya’s first ever World Series final in 2009 in Adelaide followed by a maiden semifinal appearance at the 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens in Dubai.	Ka ne pok gilocho e tugo e ma ne gidhi Singapore, ne oyudo ka Ayimba osetoleno tim mar Kenya e tugo ma ne gihango dhiye mar World seris finals ma ne otim Adelaide e higa mar 2009 kod semifinals mane otimore Dubai e higa mar 2009 e tugo miluongo ni Rugby World Cup Sevens.
But it is at the historic Singapore Sevens that Ayimba left an imprint in the game after literally killing three birds by one stone during his second short spell.	Ayimba ong'ere ahinya nikech tugo ma ne otimore Singapore kama ne ogoyoe winy adek gi kidi achiel e ndalo machuok ma ne obedogo koch.
First, he guided the team into booking its Olympics ticket in Rio before leaving a legacy of having introduced several youngsters on the World Rugby Sevens scene.	Mokwongo, ne otayo tim mar rugby mi giyudo otiko mar dhi Rio e Olimpiks kendo ibiro pare kaka ng'at ma ne omiyo rowere mang'eny oyudo thuolo mar tugo rugby e pinje maoko.
And it was after Ayimba’s reappointment following the departure of Felix Ochieng in 2015 that immediately turned around the team’s fortunes after a difficult 2014/2015 season, where they had flirted with relegation for the better part of the campaign.	Bende, ka ne Felix Ochieng' owuok e higa mar 2015, Ayimba ne okawo kare to mano ne okelo gueth ne tim bang' bedo gi chandruoge e tuke ma ne otimore 2014/2015 ma ne ok gitimoe maber ahinya.
But his return in the dugout ended on a relatively low note after disappointing outing in 2016 Rio Olympics Games, where Kenya finished eleventh on overall before guiding the team to reclaim the Safari Sevens.	Kata kamano, duoke ne ok orumo maber ruok nikech ne ok odhi e tuke Olimpiks mane otim Rio, 2016 kama Kenya ne obedoe namba apar gachiel, kata kamano, ne oduogo otayo timno e bedo joloch mag Safari Sevens.
The multi-talented Ayimba, who tried his hands and legs in nearly all sports while at Olympic Primary School, Nairobi, began his rugby career at Maseno School.  	Ayimba ma ne jatugo mang'ula, ne otemo chiegni tuke te ka ne pod en Olympic Primary School, Nairobi, to bang'e ne ochako tugo rugby ka en Maseno School.
And for Nyangaga, a man who honed Ayimba’s rugby skills at Maseno between 1991 and 1994, his student outdid him in coaching.	Nyangaga ema nopuonjo Ayimba tugo rugby ka en Maseno e higa mar 1991 nyaka 1994, to bang'e japuonjrene ne obedo koch maber moloye.
“I’m the one who introduced Benjamin to rugby. He was not a good player, but as a coach he did much better than me. It is unfortunate to hear of his demise. We have lost a great man,” said Nyangaga.	"Nyangaga wacho kama, ""An ema ne apuonjo Benjamin tugo rugby. Ne ok ong'eyo tugo rugby maber, kata kamano, ne en koch maber moloya. En gimarach ahinya ni otho. Walalo ng'at maduong'."""
However, Ayimba is credited for laying the foundation of Kenyan rugby after scouting and nurturing many players before eventually introducing some of them to the global scene.	Kata kamano, ibopar Ayimba kaka ng'at ma ne oloso mise mar rugby e piny Kenya bang' tiego jotugo mang'eny ma moko kuomgi nodhi kata mana e tuke moriwo pinje.
Samuel Oliech, Donald Aluoch, Robert Aringo, Nelson Oyoo, Jeffrey Oluoch, Alvin Otieno, Samuel Motari, Alex Olaba and Frank Wanyama were all handed their World Series debuts by Ayimba in the 2015/2016 season.	Samuel Oliech, Donald Aluoch, Robert Aringo, Nelson Oyoo, Jeffrey Oluoch, Alvin Otieno, Samuel Motari, Alex Olaba kod Frank Wanyama gin joma Ayimba ne omiyo gidhi e tukegi mokwongo moriwo pinje e higa 2015/2016.
By doing so, Ayimba was preparing for a smooth transition in Shujaa when the time comes for the likes of Humphrey Khayange, Collins Injera, Dennis Ombachi and Andrew Amonde to exit the field.	Kuom timo kamano, Ayimba ne omiyo obedo mayot wilo jotugo ka gin Shujaa sama ne kinde ochopo mondo ji kaka Humphrey Khayange, Collins Injera, Dennis Ombachi kod Andrew Amonde owe tugo rugby.
While Ayimba was critically ill and fighting for his life in a city hospital, the family was struggling to raise funds to offset an estimated medical bill of Sh 1.7 million.	Sama Ayimba ne tuo marach kendo kedo ne ngimane e osiptal, joode ne thuthni choko pesa mar chulo bill mar osiptal ma ne iwacho ni nyalo romo milion 1.7.
He had not been seen in public since the beginning of the year.	Ne ji pok onene kowuotho e lela chakre higa chakre.
Ayimba played for Impala as a rookie (backrow) in 1995 after completing his school studies and went on to captain the Red Shirts to two Kenya Cups, Enterprise Cups and Floodlit tournaments in 2000 and 2001.	Ayimba ne otugo ne tim mar Impala kaka ng'at ma mako chien e higa mar 1995 bang' tieko somo kendo nodhi bedo kapten mar Red Shirts mi giloyo Okombe Kenya ariyo, Enterprise Cups kod Floodlit tournaments ma ne otimore higa mar 2000 kod 2001.
He also inspired the team to three National Sevens Circuit titles between 1999 and 2001.	Bende ne okonyo tim loyo  National Sevens Circuit e kind higni mag 1999 kod 2001.
He then moved to record Kenyan champions Nondescripts in 2002 before joining English side Cornish Pirates the following year.	Bang'e ne omiyo Jo-Kenya olocho e Nondescripts e higa mar 2002 kae to ne e higa ma ne oluwo, ne oriwore gi Cornish Pirates mar jo Ingresa.
Before venturing into coaching, Ayimba had featured for Shujaa at the 1998,2002 and 2006 Commonwealth Games as well as the 2001 and 2005 Rugby World Cup Sevens tournaments in Argentina and Hong Kong respectively.	Ka ne pok obedo koch, Ayimba ne otugo ne Shujaa e Tuke Commonwealth mane otim e higa mar 1998, 2002 kod 2006, bende ne otugo e tuke mag Rugby Wold Cup Sevens ma ne otimore Argentina e higa mar 2001 kod Hong Kong e higa mar 2005.
He then had a short coach/player role for the Simbas before serving as Shujaa coach between 2006 and 2011 after succeeding his Impala coach Bill Githinji.	Bende, ne obed koch kod jatugo ne tim mar Simbas kuom kinde machuok eka bang'e obedo koch mar Shujaa e kind higa mar 2006 nyaka 2011 kokawo kar Bill Githinji ma ne en koch mare ka en Impala.
His achievements didn’t go unnoticed as he was awarded the Order of the Grand Warrior (OGW) by former President Mwai Kibaki.	Ker machon Mwai Kibaki ne omiye mich miluongo ni Order of the Grand Warrior (OGW) nikech gik mabeyo ma ne otimo.
Ayimba is also credited for being part of the team that introduced popular tournaments like Masaku7s, Meru 7s and Kitui 7s in the country.	Bende, iparo Ayimba kaka achiel kuom joma nokelo e pinywa tuke mong'ere kaka Masaku 7s, Meru7s, kod Kitui 7s.
Inside Paul Odera’s plan to take Kenya Simbas to first Rugby World Cup	Chenro ma Paul Odera nigo mar tero tim mar Kenya Simbas e tukgi mokwongo mar Rugby World Cup
Kenya Simbas head coach Paul Odera remains optimistic that Kenya can qualify for their first Rugby World Cup to be held in France in 2022.	Paul Odera, ma en koch maduong' mar Kenya Simbas, nigi geno ni Kenya nyalo dhi e tukgi mokwongo mar Rugby World Cup ma idhi tim France e higa mar 2022.
Despite Covid-19 restrictions restricting the currently 102 players that were called up to the national 15s rugby squad to virtual trainings, Odera believes nothing can stop them if they implement a core set of values he created ahead of their qualifying journey.	Kata obedo ni chike moket mag Covid-19 chuno ni jotugo 102 mane oyier mondo otug e tim ma oting'o jotuk rugby 15 mondo otiegre e yor vidio, Odera pod paro ni onge gima nyalo geng'ogi po nono ni gi gichako tiyo gi paro moko mane oloso mondo okonyogi locho.
Odera believes protection, respect, honesty, perseverance, leadership and warrior-ship can assist the Simbas in their quest to reach France 2023.	Odera neno ni ka giritore, gibedo gi luor, joratiro, sinani, telo ma maber kod chuny mar kedo, mano biro konyo tim mar Simbas chopo France e higa mar 2023.
“Making the World Cup in France is something much bigger than just rugby for us,” Odera told World Rugby.	"Odera nonyiso World Rugby kama, ""Tugo e World Cupe piny France en gima lich ahinya kuomwa moloyo tugo atuga rugby."""
“To us, it's to bring the country together, to bring all the different races, tribes, ethnic groups and disparate social groups together for the country to start believing in the men.”	"Odhi nyime wacho ni, ""Wan wakawo tugono kaka gima riwo piny, ma kelo ogendni duto, dhoudi, kod ji moa e grube mopogore opogore kanyachiel mondo piny ochak bedo gi yie kuom ji."""
“What's driving me is my passion and that passion is what I'm trying to get into the players, into my coaching staff, into the Kenya Rugby Union as an organisation.”	"""Gima chwala en hera ma aherogo tugo to herano ema adwaro ni jotugo obedgo kod joma tiyo koda kaka koch e Kenya Rugby Union kaka riwruok."""
“We are transforming this country through the game of rugby and we're going to get success on the field and we're going to get success off the field,” he said.	"Nowacho kama, ""Waloko pinyni kokalo kuom tugo mar rugby kendo wadhi locho e pap kod oko mar pap."""
The Simbas are scheduled to host Senegal and Zambia in Nairobi in July in Pool B of the second round of African qualification for RWC 2023.	Simbas dhi tugo gi tugo gi Senegal kod Zambia e dwe mar Julai Nairobi e Pool B e kare mar ariyo mar African qualification for RWC 2023.
Kenya have won both of their previous test meetings with Senegal, while their only defeat to Zambia came 41 years ago.	Kenya osebedo ka locho e tuke ma gisebedego gi Senegal to Zambia noloyogi mana dichiel higni 41 mokalo.
However, the Simbas have not played a competitive test since their Victoria Cup win over Zimbabwe in September 2019, while the country’s domestic competition was suspended in March due to the pandemic.	Kata kamano, Simba pok opiem e tugo moro amora chakre ne giloch e Victoria Cup kama ne giloyo Zimbabwe Septemba higa mar 2019, to tuke mag piem mitimo ei Kenya ne ochung e dwe mar Mach nikech tuo mokwako piny.
And, although two of the three teams will progress to the next round, Odera is still worried that a lack of match practice and conditioning could hurt his side.	To kata obedo ni ariyo kuom timbe adekgo biro dhi e okang' mar ariyo mar piem, Odera wacho ni tim mare biro hinyore ka ok gitugo tuke mitiegruokgo.
Kenya came closer than they ever have done to realising their Rugby World Cup dream three years ago when the team qualified for the tournament in Marseille as Africa 2.	Lek ma Kenya nigago mar tugo rugby e World Cup ne chiegni timore higni adek mokalo ka ne timno olocho kaka Afrika 2 e tugo ma ne otim Marseille.
However, it turned into a sobering experience as the Simbas lost each of their three matches in the south of France to Canada, Hong Kong and Germany.	Kata kamano, lekno ne olal nono ka ne Simbas orem e tuke adek ma ne gitimo milambo mar France ma ne ologi gi Canada, Hong Kong kod Germany.
Odera and Kenya know how hard it is to navigate the repechage, and the coach is, therefore, keen to secure the team’s return to France as Africa 1, an ambition he thinks is achievable.	Odera kaachiel gi Jo Kenya ong'eyo kaka en gima yot locho kendo omiyo koch temo matek monod tim odhi otug France kaka Afrika 1, to mano lek ma oparo ni ginyalo chopo.
Taking heart from the win his Kenya U20 team recorded over Namibia to qualify for the World Rugby U20 Trophy 2019, Odera believes the Simbas can do similar if they improve their success rate in key areas of the game, including the lineout, kicking and tackling.	Locho mane tim mar Kenya U20 oloyogo Namibia mondo gidhi e piem mar World Rugby U20 Trophy 2019, ne ojiwo ahinya Odera kendo koro oneno ni Simbas nyalo locho kamano ka gitimo dongruok e kuonde madongo ahinya mag tugo kaka gipangore, gweyo opira kod mecho.
“We want to transform our country, leadership and our identity; inspiring pride and love for the people of Kenya through rugby,” he said.	"Nowacho kama, ""Wadwaro loko pinywa, yo ma jotelo lochogo kod kaka ji nenowa, kendo jiwo hera manie kind Jo Kenya kokalo kuom tugo mar rugby."""
Innocent Simiyu: We are ready for Olympics scrum down	Innocent Simiyu ne owacho kama: Waikore ne tuke Olimpiks
Kenya Sevens head coach Innocent Simiyu is confident Shujaa will be ready for the Tokyo Olympics when the global games begin on July 23.	Koch maduong' mar Kenya Sevens nigadier ni Shujaa biro bedo moikore ne tuke Olimpiks e piny Tokyo ka tukego ochakore Julai 23.
Speaking after guiding the national rugby Sevens team to a second-place finish at the two-week Rugby Africa Solidarity Camp mini-friendly tournaments in South Africa, Simiyu is optimistic the team would have worked out all their errors and team chemistry before heading to Tokyo.

“We are happy with the performance of the team so far in the last three pre-Olympic invitational tournaments. Getting match fitness has been our key agenda especially after a long layoff due to Covid-19 pandemic,” said Simiyu.	"Simiyu nowacho ni, ""Wamor gi kaka tim osetugo e tuke adek mitiegruokgo ne Olimpiks. Dwach maduong' osebedo ikore ne tugo nikech ne wakawo ndalo mogwaro ka ok watug nikech Covid-19."""

Shujaa, who were using the tournament as part of their preparations for the Tokyo Olympic Games, lost 31-5 to South Africa 1 in the final of the two-day event.

This was Kenya’s fourth consecutive loss against the Blitzboks in the tournament. 	Koro mae en tieng' mar ang'wen moluwore ma Blitzboks oloyo jo Kenya e tugo.
The coach said their focus turns to their last pre-Olympic tournament in USA next month.	Koch nowacho ni pachgi sani nitie kuom tuke miikruogo ne Olimpiks ma dhi timore USA dwe manyien.
With the Tokyo Olympic Games quickly approaching, Quest for Gold Sevens has confirmed international men’s and women’s teams to compete in an exhibition tournament at Dignity Health Sports Park in Los Angeles from June 25-26.

Having catapulted Nakuru High School to become regional champions in East Africa Schools Games, three ace rugby players scored straight As (KCSE 2020) in different subjects and want to become top professionals.

As much as they were top players in the first school team, they are out to emerge as top professionals in their respective academic professions at the universities.	Kata obedo ni ne gin jotugo madongo e tim margi mar skul, gin e yo mar bedo gi tije madongo ka luwore gi gik ma gisomo e yunivasiti ma gintiere.
Brian Njoroge (eighthman), Michael Denga (centre) and scrum-half Moses Furore are ready to begin a new chapter in their academic lives after a marvellous performance in the recently released KCSE examinations, a move that has prompted regional rugby tactician and the school's principal Mike Yator to appeal to national selectors to focus on the trio as potential future star players.	Brian Njoroge (ng'at mar aboro), Michael Denga (diere) kod Moses Furore oikore chako ngima manyien e sombgi bang' kalo maber penj mar KCSE, to mano ne omiyo jatend skundgi, Mike Yator ma be en en jatelo mar rugby e alworano, okwayo joma yiero jotuk rugby mar piny mondo opar ji adekgo kaka joma nyalo bedo jotugo e kinde mabiro.
"""They excelled in the pitch and as well in their academics. I appeal to national coaches to give them a chance at the national teams while pursuing their studies at the universities,” said Yator."	"Yotor ne owacho niya, ""Ne gitimo maber e pap kod penj. Daher kwayo koch mar tim mar piny mondo omigi thuolo mar bedo e tim sama gisomo e yunivasiti."""
The trio of Njoroge, Denga and Furore, who all are aged 18 years, scored Mean Grades of A (81 points), A- (76 points) and B+ (68 points) want to study Civil Engineering, Marine Engineering and Law respectively.	Ji adekgo ma gin Njoroge, Denga kod Furore, duto johigni 18 to ne giyudo alama mar A (81 points), A- (76 points) kod B+ (68 points) to gidwaro somo Civil Engineering, Marine Engineering and Chik.
Interestingly, the trio had scored over 300 marks in their KCPE Examinations with Njoroge scoring 380, Denga 368 and Furore 351 marks.	Gimiwuoro en ni giduto ne giyudo maks mokalo 300 e penj mar KCPE ka Njoroge noyudo 380, Denga 368 to Furore 351.
Besides their academic excellence, none of them is ready to stop playing rugby.	Kata obedo ni giduto ne gitimo maber e penj, giduto ok gidwar weyo tugo rugby.
They hope to proceed with it at the university with an eye of hoping to be selected into the National Sevens and Fifteens teams.	Gigeno ni gibiro dhi nyime tugo ka gin e yunivasiti kendo gigombo ni oyiergi gidonj e tim mar National Sevens kod tim mar Fifteens.
"""Rugby is part of my diet and it will remain so at the university,"" said Njoroge who scored five straight As in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Geography and Art and Designs."	"Njoroge mane ne oyudo As abich e Kwano, Physics, Chemistry, Geography kod Art and Designs, wacho kama: ""Rugby en chiemba ma odiechieng' kodiechieng' to obiro siko kamano nyaka ka an e yunivasiti."""
Denga, who is the first school rugby captain in the institution's history, said the sport had inspired his academic progress.	Denga ma kapten mokwongo e skundno, wacho ni tugono ema nokonye timo maber e penj.
"""Had it not been rugby and the discipline it carries with it, I believe my performance in this exam would have been different today."	"Owacho kama, ""Dine bed ni ok atug rugby, ok apar ka dine ayudo alama ma ne ayudo e penjni."
"""This is because the inspiration instilled in us during our training sessions was carried to the classroom in equal measure and it motivated me to catch up with the rest in the class to emerge as the best ever school rugby captain,""  a confident Denga stated."	Mano en nikech ne atiyo gi weche ma ne ijiwowago e rugby sama an e klas to mano ne konya mondo atem matek kik adong' chien gi kama ji osesomo e klas, to mano emomiyo abedo kapten mokwongo timo maber e penj.
On his part, Furore who wants to study Law at the University of Nairobi, thanked Kenya Lionesses Head Coach Felix Oloo for his inspiration and skills learnt in the training sessions at Nakuru RFC Development Program while still at New Life School Academy in Nakuru Municipality.	Furore ma dwaro somo Chik e Yunivasiti mar Nairobi, nogoyo erokamano ne Felix Oloo ma en koch mar Kenya Lionesses nikech ne otiegogi kendo puonjogi sama ne gitiegore e Nakuru RFC Development Program ndalo ma pod ne en New Life School Academy mantie Nakuru Municipality.
"""That is where I started my rugby career as a junior player while still in primary school and rose through the ranks in development sides to become a refined player for my school team,"" Furore told The Standard Sports."	"Furore nonyiso The Standard Sports ni, ""Mano e kama ne achokoe tugo rugby katin kapod an en e skund praimari kendo natimo dongruok ma abedo jatugo maber ne tim mar skundwa."""
The trio was in the Nakuru RFC development side that toured United Kingdom in 2015, Kigali, Rwanda in 2018 and Jinja, Uganda in 2019 in junior rugby championships.	Ji adekgo ne nie Nakuru RFC development ma ne olimo United Kingdom e higa mar 2015, Kigali, Rwanda e higa mar 2018 kod Jinja, Uganda e higa mar 2019 e tuke mag junior rugby championships.
In the United Kingdom where they participated in the Festivals of Rugby, Nakuru RFC III finished runners up, won the Rwanda Connect to Africa Rugby Championships in 2018 and also finished runners up in Jinja Connect to Africa Rugby Championships the following year (2019).	E piny United Kingdom kama ne gintie e Nyasi mag Rugby, Nakuru RFC III ne obedo namba ariyo, ne gilocho e tuke mag Rwanda Connect to Africa Rugby Championships e higa mar 2018, kae to higa manoluwo (2019), ne gibedo namba ariyo e tuke mag Jinja Connect to Africa Rugby Championships.
While thanking their principal Yator and school coach Reynold Kaunda, the trio said in unison that experiences shaped their life in general.	Ne giwacho ni gik ma ne gineno ne omiyo puonj moko mokonyo ngimagi kendo ne gigoyo erokamano ne japuonjgi maduong', Yator kod koch margi Reynold Kaunda.
Yator said the record set by the trio is a precedent that will go a long way in being emulated by many players who will pass through different coaches in the school's rugby history.	Yator ne owacho ni ji adekgo oweyo rekod ma ibiro luw gi jotugo mang'eny e kinde mabiro e bwo koch mopogore opogore.
"""This is a rich rugby history mixed with rich academic records that will live to be remembered to inspire more players who'll aspire to emulate them,"" Yator, who is also a qualified athletics and rugby coach, said."

Shujaa, who were using the tournament as part of their preparations for the Tokyo Olympic Games, suffered a 31-5 defeat to South Africa 1 in the finals of the two-day event. This was Kenya's fourth consecutive loss against the Blitzboks in the tournament. 	Shujaa ma ne tiyo tugono kaka yorgi mar ikruok ne tuke Olimpiks ma dhi Tokyo, ne olo gi South Africa ma ne oyudo alama 31 to gin 5 e tugo mogik mane okawo ndalo ariyo.

Kenya took an early 5-0 lead after a missed conversion in the opening minutes of the match after Odhiambo touchdown in the left corner from a quick restart by Humwa after overturning possession on a Ugandan attack.	Kenya nomondo telo gi alama 5 e dakika mokwongo okwongo mag tugo sama Odhiambo noringo gi opira e kona koracham kae to Humwa okawo opira motamo jo Uganda maye.
Odhiambo soon made it 12-0 after Tony Omondi’s conversion. Collins Injera’s clever pass of the rack found an unmarked Odhiambo who raced to the try line to dot Kenya’s second try of the match.

Maseno School rugby players qualify for university after passing KCSE exams	Jotugo mag rugby ma ne somo Maseno School oyudo thuolo mar dhi e yunivasiti bang' kalo penj mar KCSE.
Kenya National Secondary School Rugby heavyweights Maseno School have sent all their rugby players to the university.	Maseno School ma ema gin ga joloch mag rugby e piem mag skunde e piny Kenya, okowo jotugoge te e yunivasiti.
This is after all 21 players from the Kisumu based secondary school scored C+ and above in the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) that were released on Monday.	Jotugo 21 e skul ma nitie Kisumuno ne oyudo alama mar C+ e penj mar KCSE ma ne ochiw dwokogi Wuok Tich.
Speaking to The Standard Sports, Maseno School rugby coach Paul Nyamita said he is proud of all his 21 players who featured in both 7s and 15s school teams.	Paul Nyamita ma en koch mar rugby e Maseno School, ne onyiso The Standard Sports ni omor ahinya gi jotugoge 21 mane nie tim mag 7s kod 15s mar skul.
“Covid-19 spoiled the game but we won academic battle. All my smart rugby players are joining university. I am very proud and humbled to be part of this amazing school,” said Nyamita who doubles as Maseno School’s English teacher.	"Nyamita ne owacho kama, ""Covid-19 ne okethnwa tugo, penj to ne wakalo.

Five time national rugby 7s champions Maseno School had just qualified for the Nyanza Regional Secondary School Games when the coronavirus pandemic struck, blowing away the schools dream of lifting the 2020 Kenya National Secondary School rugby 7s and 15s title.	Maseno School oselocho nyadi bich national rugby 7s champions kendo ne giikore ne tuke mag Nyanza Regional Secondary School Games ka ne tuo mar korona osieko ma miyo okombe ma 2020 obayogi.
However, Nyamita said he called upon his players to forget about rugby and turn their attention to academics, a move that played out to be successful.	Kata kamano, Nyamita ne onyiso jotugo mage ni gigol pachgi e rugby to kar mano gichak somo, to mano nokelo nyak maber.
“I told my rugby players to quickly shift focus to academic after learning that Covid-19 will interfere with sports not only in Kenya but globally. They didn't disappoint. I can’t even describe how I am feeling right now,” said Nyamita, an author of English Demystified Revision Paper 1,2 and 3 series.	"Nyamita ma ondiko buge mag English Demystified Revision Paper 1,2 and 3 nowacho niya, ""Bang' fwenyo ni Covid-19 dhi chocho tuko e Kenya kod piny mangima, ne anyiso jotuga maga mondo giket pachgi e somo.

Otieno was impressed by his appointment to officiate in Russia and promised to give his best at a time Confederation of African Boxing((CAB) is equally shopping for officials from the continent to officiate in Japan.

The female players who lost in the opening matches were Commonwealth Games flyweight bronze medalist Christine Ongare and national welterweight champion Elizabeth Akinyi.

Ongare was beaten on unanimous points’ decision by Diana Gorishnaya of Estonia while Akinyi lost to Maria Moronto of Dominican Republic also on points.	Ongare ne olo gi Diana Gorishnaya ma wuok Estonia, to Akinyi ne olo gi Maria Moronto mawuok Dominican Republic.
Benjamin said their prime objective in Russia was to give the four players exposure against refined opponents ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.	Benjamin ne owacho gima duong' ma ne oterogi Russia ne en miyo jotugogo thuolo mar neno joma gibiro kedogo molony ka pok gidhi e Olimpiks ma dhi timore Tokyo e higa mar 2020.
“This tournament came at the right time to prepare players for the big games after a long lay-off due to Coronavirus pandemic. It is giving us exposure on possibilities of meeting the same opponents in preliminary matches at the Olympics,” Benjamin told The Standard Sports.	"Benjamin ne owache ne Standard Sport, ""Tuke mag piem gi nobiro e sa ma owinjore mondo oik jotugo ne tuke maduong ma ne oyudo oket tenge kuom kinde malach nikech midhusi mar korona.

Ongare blamed her defeat on temper after she was severally held and pushed by her opponent without the intervention of the referee.	Ongare ne oseyo loch mane oloyego kowacho ni ne oloye nikech mirima bang' rifari rem kawo okang' ne jatugo wadgi mane osiko ka make kendo dhire nyadinuoya
“My opponent kept on holding on me as she pushed me around, which made me lose temper and control of the game against Gorishnaya without intervention of the referee who instead penalized me,” Ongare told The Standard Sports from Russia.	"""Jatugo wadwa ne siko tweyore kuoma kendo dhira kinde duto, gino mane omiyo mirima omaka kendo nayudo chochni e tukwa gi Gorishnaya bang' rifari rem kawo okang' moro amora ne jatugo no kendo miya kum"".

However, she said the standards in Europe were far ahead of Africa as it gave her the experience required to take part in the Olympics.	Kata kamano, ne owacho ni okange mag piny Yurop ni nyime ahinya moloyo Afrika kendo ne omiye lony ma dwarore mar bedo e tuke mag Olimpik.
On her part, Akinyi was not aggressive against Moronto (Maria) in the first two rounds only to recover in the third one but by then it was too late to catch up with her opponent.	Kor ka kore Akinyi ne ok onyiso thuone ne Moronto (Maria) e tielo ariyo motelo mag tugo eka bang'e ochiero tekre e tielo mar adek, to kata kamano mano ne ose deko  kendo ne ok onyal juko jatugo wadgi no.
Benjamin said a cut sustained by Akinyi in her mouth also contributed to her defeat as she kept on backpedalling in the last two rounds.	Benjamin bende ne owacho ni hinyruok mane Akinyi oyudo e dhoge bende ochwalo loch mane oloyego nikech ne osiko odok chien ahinya e tielo ariyo mogik mag tugo no.
“It was too late for her to beat her in the third round with the cut,” said Benjamin.	"""Ne osedeko ahinya ma ne ok onyal loyo e tielo mar adek kaluwore gi ng'at mane dhoge ong'adore go,"" Benjamin nowacho."
Out of the four boxers, it is only two-time Olympian and Africa Zone Three super heavyweight champion Elly Ajowi who is yet to take the ring.

Kenya's hope of featuring in the Euro/Africa Group 2 tournament later in September this year were shattered in March after Ismael Changawa and Ibrahim Kibet lost 6-7, 7-6, 7-6 to Christopher Rungkat and David Susanto of Indonesia in the best-of-five Euro/Africa Group 2 playoffs at the Gelora Bung Karno tennis court in Jarkarta.

Growing up, I learned the fundamentals from the various teams that I played on.	Ka adongo, ne apuojora gik mochuno kuom kidienje duto mane atugo e.
The coaches would teach you the basics of passing, dribbling, shooting, etc.	Jopuonj ne nyalo puonji diro ne ngato, minruok e kind ji gi loyo kod ma moko.

He was a very good basketball player himself, so he would always help me practice and teach me things about how to be a successful player. 	Ne en jatugo maber mar opich okapu en owuon, koro ne oja puonja ga tugo, kod kaka anyalo bedo jatugo ma dhi maber.

Honestly, representing Kenya and upsetting Angola has been the most memorable moment in my career to date.	Adier chung e lo Kenya kod kuodo wi Angola osebedo kinde moko mag rapar madongo e tijani nyaka kawuono.
To be able to be a part of history and help guide the country back to Afrobasket for the first time in nearly 30 years, there’s nothing else in a career that can top that feeling currently.

What are some of your experiences playing basketball? Lessons learnt?	Ango gini ma iseromo go e tugo mar opich okapu? Puonj mage misesomo?
There are many parallels in basketball, or any sport, and life. 	Nitie gik moko ma ok nyal romo e opich okapu kata tuke ma moko e ngima.
Sports are a powerful tool which can help to teach valuable life lessons in a way that most other things can’t.	Tuke gin gik ma rateke ma inyalo tigo e chiwo puonj puonjo man gi nengo e ngima e yo ma gik ma moko ok nyal.
For me personally, I’ve learned from basketball about determination, sacrifice, and battling through adversity.	Ne an awuon asesomo kowuok kuom opich okapu weche mag geno, chiwruok, gi kedo ei chandruok.
I was ranked as the 17th best player in my senior class in the state of New Mexico, which isn’t known for producing high level basketball talent. 	Ne orieda kaka jatuo maber e thuolo mar 17 ekidieny mar joma otegno e piny mar New Mexico ma bende ok onge e golo jotugo mabeyo man gi were ma malo e opich okapu.
Hardly anyone thought that I was good enough to play in college, and I used that to motivate me to work that much harder and prove them wrong. 	Ngang' ne onge ngama ne ong'eyo ni anyalo bedo maber moromo tugo e Kolej, to natiyo gi mano mar miyora mijing'o mar tiyo matek mondo akwed paro gi no.

After my two years at TSJC, I only had one scholarship offer which was to Norfolk State University (NSU). 	Bang' higni maga ariyo e TSJC, ne ayudo mana sir achiel mar somo ma ne dhi e Mbalariany mar Norfolk (NSU).
I was always determined to do what it took to play NCAA Division 1 basketball and God blessed me with that opportunity. 	Ne aikora ga mar timo gik moko duto ma ne dwarore mondo atug opich okapu e NCAA Division 1 to Nyasaye nonogwedha gi thuolo no.
I also learned that you have to be willing to sacrifice certain things to achieve your dreams. 	Bende ne asepuonjora ga ni nyaka ibed gi chuny mar tuonruok gik moko mondo ichop lek magi.
For me, I had to sacrifice time spent hanging out with my friends.	Anto ne ochuna atuonora seche ma abudho go gi osiepe.
While they were out partying and having fun, I was at the gym working on my craft and getting better. 	Kane gin oko kanyo ka giwinjo maber kendo gimor, ne an eod orako ka atiyo matek kendo ka amedo berora.
I had to really narrow down my circle of friends and prioritize my time with the ones who had the same mindset as me. 	Ne ochuna ni mondo adi aluora na mar osiepe kendo ne ayiero dong mana gi osiepe mani gi paro machal gi mara.
As far as adversity goes, I had to have a major operation that required 7 months of physical therapy. 	mna kaka chandruok dhi, ne nyaka adh e bero mane dwaro ni nyaka akaw dweche 7 mag thieth mar ringruok.
Initially, I was having to go 2 times a day 5 days a week so that I could regain the range of motion in my elbow, otherwise, it would’ve been permanently locked up and not straight. 	Chon ne chuna ni nyaka adhi diriyo ndalo abich e juma mando okumbo na onyal tiyo makare, ka ok kamano, dine omoko matek kendo ka ok oriere.
Mentally, going through the recovery process is very hard. 	Gi eparo, kalo e yor chang tek ahinya.
I couldn’t use my dominant arm for everyday tasks and I didn’t know how my shot would be once I finished the rehab process. 	Ne ok anayal tiyo gi lweta ma ongiyo, e tiyo tije na mapile ka pile kendo ne ok angeyo kaka loyo done obedo na ka asetieko kindenda mag kwo.
It’s also difficult sitting on the sidelines the whole season and watching your team take the floor every night without you. 	Bende en gima tek oko kinde duto mag tugo ka ing'iyo mana kaka jou tugo oyieno ka otieno ka into ionge kodgi.
I had to fight through the physical and mental pain of that injury and rehab process to get back to being the player that I knew I could be.	Ne nyaka aked ei rem mar ringruok gi mar paro kuom hinyruok na , kod ndalo na mag kwo mondo adog abed jatugo mane anyalo bedo.

As I stated early my main plan is to play in the Australian NBL and have success there. 	Kaka ne asewacho motelo dwaro na maduong en tugo e Australia NBL gi yudo gik ma agombo duto kanyo.
Playing in the NBL will allow me to be with my wife for the majority of the year, rather than being separated for 8-9 months while I’m in Europe playing. 	Tugo e NBL biro miyo abed gi chiega kinde mangeny e higa, mopogore gi bedo mabor kode dweche 8-9 ka atugo e piny Yurop.
Off the court, I enjoy travelling and exploring new places. 	Oko mar pap, a winjo maber ka abayo kendo afwenyo kuonde manyien.

The league is split into two categories, Pro A (which mine and Tylor’s team compete in) and Pro B. The league consists of 10 teams of which the top 8 qualify for playoffs.

Since I grew up in the States, I didn’t know of any Kenyan basketball players. 	To nokech ne adongo loka, ne ok ang'eyo jatugo moro amora mar opich okapu ma Kenya.
My favourite player growing up and of all time was Kobe Bryant, so he is the one that I looked up to.	Jatuka ma nageno ahinya e dongo na duto ne en Kobe Bryant, en ema ne achiko wang'a kuome.

Earlier in February, Bungei was among the 12 players who helped Kenya qualify for the 2021 Afrobasket tournament for the first time in 28 years.	Motelo e dwe mar Ariyo, Bungei ne achiel kuom jotugo 12 mane okonyo Kenya ngado otiko mag donjo e piem mar Afrobasket nya di mokuongo e higni 20.
His journey to playing for the national team began on a rather bumpy ride after FIBA prevented him from playing because he did not have a permanent Kenyan passport.	Wuodhe ka odhi e kidieny ma tugo ne pinygi, nochakore e yo ma ochuanyore ochuanyore matin bang ka FIBA otame etugo nikech ne oonge gi otiko mochwere mar bedo e kenya.
Watching the competition from the sidelines, Bungei’s absence from the court was felt as Morans got narrow success in the first round after beating Mozambique 79-62 in their final match after previously losing to Senegal and Angola in Group B.	Ka ni ng'iyo tugo no gi e bath pap, onge mar Bungei ne onenore ayanga ka jo Morans tony gi loch modhero e tielo mokuongo bang' goyo Mozambique 79-62 e tik gi mogik ka ne oselogi gi Senegal kod Angola e Girup B.
“I was disappointed after all the preparations and time and then learning you’re not able to play, it hurt,” said Bungei.	"""Ne ane marach ahinya ka bang' ikruok duto gi seche kae to bange ifwenyo ni ok idhi tugo, olit,"" Bungei nowacho."
But in February, he was handed the opportunity to don the Kenyan colours and despite losing 69-51 to Senegal, Bungei finished the match as Kenya’s best player with 11 points.	To ka ne Ochopo e dwe mar Ariyo ne omiye thuolo mar rwakore gi rangi mag Kenya kata obedo ni ne ologi e tugo no gi Senegal 69-51, Bungei notieko tugo no kaka jatugo maber mogik mar Kenya gi point 11.
He followed his impressive debut performance with another 10 points in Kenya’s historic 74-73 win over Angola, a victory that saw them qualify for the Afrobasket set to be held in Rwanda this year.	Ne oluwo tuke maber no gi tich moro machielo mar point 10 e sigand Kenya ma ne giloyo Angola 74-73, loch mane omiyo goyudo otiko mar donjo e Afrobasket ma onego timre e higa ni.
“I just can’t describe the feeling. Tylor hitting the game winning shot and us qualifying, is a memory that I’ll carry with me forever,” said Bungei.	"""Ok anyal kata nyiso kit mor ma an go. Tylor ka loyo gol ma kelo loch  kod gin ka giyudo otiko, en rapar ma abiro tingo nyaka chieng',"" Bungei nowacho."
“I give credit to this group of players who started this journey to or three years ago, when nobody knew or cared about who the Morans were. And yes, I plan to continue playing for the Morans moving forward for as long as they’ll have me and want me on board.”	""" Achiwo puoch je kidieny mar jotugo ma ne ochako tugo ni higni ariyo kata adek mokalo, e kinde ma ne onge kata ng'ama dewo ni Morans gin ng'ano gini.

The forward player, who currently plays for Randers Cimbria in Denmark, dreams of honouring his father who died in 2011 by helping Kenya win a continental championship.	Jatugo ma nyime, ma sani tugo ne Randers Cimbira e Denmark, ni gi lek mar chiwo luor ne wuon mare mane otho e higa mar 2011, kokonyo Kenya loyo piem mag Continental Championship.
Bungei, who carries athletic genes from his late father James Bungei, was born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1995.	Bungei, ma otingo nyiriri mag nyodo mar jang'wech kowuok juom wuon mare ma ne osenindo James Bungei, ne onyuol e Albuquerque e New Mexico e higa mar 1995.
Just like his father, Preston grew up running cross country and track and field. However, all that stopped as he chose to focus more on basketball.	Mana kaka wuon mare, Preston ne odongo ka oringo ng'we ng'ado kor gwenge gi mag alap. to kata kamano, mago duto ne ochung ka ne oyiero chiko wange e opich okapu.
“My mother introduced me to basketball when I was five years old because most of my her relatives were basketball players. When I was about three years, she got me a plastic hoop for Christmas and said I would just stand there and shoot on it all day long,” said Bungei.	"""Mama wa norwaka e tuk opich okapu ka a ja higni abich nekech anyuola gi mathoth ne jotugo mag opich okapu.

Despite falling short of a state championship while he was in high school and college, Bungei started making strides after going professional in 2018.	Kata obedo ni ne orem yudo loch ne piny gi ka ne en e sikund sekondar kata e mbalariany, Bungei ne ochako goyo ondamo ka osebedo jalony e higa mar 2018.
After a successful stint with Trinidad State Junior College and Norfolk State University which featured in the NCAA Division 1, Bungei joined Jazine Arbanasi in Croatian Prva Liga.

In Croatia, Bungei recorded impressive stats as he averaged 17 points per game.	E piny bCroatia, Bungei ne ondiko rekod ma lombo wang' ka ne ondiko point ma dirom 17 e tugo ka tugo.
He was named in the All-Croatian Prva Liga Honorable Mention and won the League Player of the Week four times for the 2018-2019 season.	Ne oluong nyinge e nyadhi mar joma oluor mag Prva Liga kendo noloyo thuolo mar Jatugo ma ber mogik mar juma e lig no nyadingwen e higa 2019-2019.
Why sports ban won’t slow down Kisumu Lakeside’s hunger for success	Gima omiyo chungo tuke ok no dwok chien kech mar jo Kisumu Lakers ma loch.
Kisumu Lakeside Basketball Club is optimistic of performing well in the 2021 Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) Men’s Premier League despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic which is continuing to disrupt sporting activities across the country.	Jo opich okapu ma Kisumu Lakeside ni gi chir mar timo maber e higa tuke mag Kenya Basketball Federation ma 2021 (KBF) mar joma chwo kata obedo ni chandruok mag midhusi mar Korona ma pod dhi nyime gi chando tuke e piny.
Last month, the KBF topflight league was suspended temporarily by the Government due to rising cases of COVID-19 in the country, hitting a huge blow to the Kisumu side which had just started building their momentum.	Dwe mokalo chakruok mar tuke mag KBF ne ochungi apoya gi piny owacho ne kech medruok mar Covid 19 e piny Kenya, ka mana nogoyo chuny jo Kisumuma ne osechako iko tegruok gi.
Prior to the halting of the league, Lakeside had played five games losing four against EMYBA, Thunder, Eldonets and KPA.	Motelone  chung' mar lig, jo Lakeside ne osetugo tuke a bich ka giwito loch gi ne EMYBA, Thunder, Eldonets gi KPA.
Their only win came against Ulinzi Warriors, with the Kisumu team shocking the defending champions 61-59, a win Lakeside Secretary General Bria Lusaga believes would have set the momentum heading towards facing other opponents.	Loch gi makende owuon ne en ka gitugo gi Ulinzi Worriors, ka jo kisumu go buogo jo ting' loch mag tugono gi seche go 61-59, loch ma jagoro mongirore mar Lakeside Brian Lusaga ogeno ni dine ochako ayanga tekruok mag rakruok gi gi jo piem ma moko.
Speaking to The Standard Sports, Lusaga, who also doubles as the assistant coach, said they were disappointed by the ‘no sports’ Government order but remain buoyant of achieving success this calendar year.	"Kowuoyo gi The Standard Sports, Lusaga ma bende en konchiel kaka japuonj matin, nowacho ni ok gimor gi lendo mar piny owacho mar ""onge tuke' to omor gi geno ni gibiro yudo loch e higa ni."
“The team had picked momentum and was ready to take on the next opponents. Some players had already made job schedules that would allow them honour matches and with the ban, it means their plans have been interfered with and that may affect us when sports resume.”	"""Tieng mar jotugo no nesemako chir kendo oikore mar rakruok gi jotuge ma moko. Jotugo moko ne ose kwayo thuolo e tije gi mondo giyud kinde ma kende mar miyo luor tuke gi go, to mano nyiso ni chenro gi osekethore kendo mano biro miyo wa chandruok e kinde ma tuke oduogo ayanga."""
“The management had also paid for training facility for the year, that would go to waste too. However, we are choosing to remain positive and hopeful for a better year and not a sports-less season that was 2020,” said Lusaga.	"""Jotelo bende ne osechulo  kuonde tiegruok mar higa, mano bende biro kethore nono. Kata kamano wayiero mar mondo wabed gi geno kendo gi ilo to ok ne higa ma onge tuke ma ne en 2020,"" Lusaga nowacho."
Lakeside head coach Dismas Oketch echoed his assistants’ sentiments by saying other teams are lucky because of the temporary suspension of the league otherwise they would have faced a totally different Lakeside team compared to the side that lost four straight games.	Japuonj maduong mar Lakeside nochoro weche go mag jalupne kowacho ni timbe mamoko ni gi hawi kokalo kuom chungo mar tukego nekech ka ok mano to di ne giromo gi Lakeside moro mopogore gi ma ne owito tuke angwen moriere ka.
“Winning against the defending champs to break our losing streak was big, it's an eye opener that any team is beatable in the league. This would of cause psyched the team heading to our next matches but unfortunately, the league was suspended.”	"""Loyo joting okumba e tukego mondo watiek hawi mar wito tuke no ne en gima duong', en rayaw wang' ni tim moro amora inyalo loo e truke go, mano dine omedo maw kuom jotugo, to kata kamano tuke go ne ongad oko."""
Being at 1-4, we are maintaining our focus by doing what's been working and improving on our weaknesses. We had used the previous four losses in understanding where our systems were faulty, analysing and rectifying on our mistakes during current practice,” said Oketch, commonly referred to as ‘DC’.	"Bedo e kind 1-4, medo chik ma wachiko go wang'wa kuom timo mana gik ma osebedo ka tiyo kod jiwo kuonde nyaw wa.Ne wasetiyo gi loch ma ne olowago ang'wen ka mondo wang'e go kuonde ma gige wa ne nyap go, nono kendo loko kuonde mane ok watimee maber e kinde magwa mag orako ma sani,"" Oketch ma bende ong'ere kaka 'DC' ne owacho kamano."
“For the previous seasons it's been a mental kind of thing that winning on the road is something else, but I believe the current team is set to make that perception a thing of the past.”	"""Kuom kinde tuke mokalo, ose bedo gimoro mar paro ni yudo loch e ndara en gimoro nono, to ageno ni tim ma sani oikore mar nyiso ni paro ma kamano en en mana wach kinde mosekalo."
Lusaga said Oketch, who joined the club during their maiden season win against Ulinzi will be a key figure in turning out Lakeside into a serious basketball force.	Lusaga nowacho ni Oketch, ma ne oriwore gi jotugo go e kinde mane eka giyudo loch ma miaha, e kindgi gi Ulinzi, nobed siro ma ongirore mar loko Lakeside obed gi teko mongi'th.
“Oketch was an instant hit. He is a long-serving lakeside player who understands the structures of the team. After retiring the management helped facilitate for his coaching course. DC is firm and reads the game well.  He is the next big thing in the coaching world,” said Lusaga.	"""Oketch ne en koch mowinjore. En jatugo ma ndalo malach mar Lakeside, ma winjo fuonde tim kaka tiyo. Bang dhi e rutaya, jotelo ne okonye yudo tiegruok mag puonjo. DC ogurore kende osomo ga tugo maber.En e gimoro macielo maduongie ei alap mar jopuonj tugo,"" Lusaga nowacho."
Lakeside signed Ocholla Bryan from KPA, Marko Odhiambo from KU Pirates, Joshua Carter from Barcelona, George Collins, Jayden Simiyu and Allan Kibira seeking to better their last season’s quarterfinals playoffs achievements.	Lakeside ne ondiko Ocholla Bryan kowuok KPA, Marko Odhiambo mar KU Pirates, Joshua Carter mawuok Barcelona, George Collince, Jayden Simiyu gi Allan Kibira ka gidwaro bero tukegi mokalo fainol mag kwota.
“Joshua Carter is a talented guard standing at 6.2', he is still adjusting to the physicality of the league, he is picking up well and his commitment to training is impressive. He will surely bring us the wins we want,” said Lusaga on their international player who used to play in Spain.	"""Joshua Carter en ja rito man gi were ka borne ochung e 6.2', pod ojiwore e tekruok ma lig, okwanyo maber kendo kindane e tiegruok kelo mor. Adiera obiro kelonwa loch duto mawadwaro,"" lusaga ne owacho mago e wi jatuk gi mar pinje ma ne tugo ga e piny Spain."
Lusaga added that they have come up with a training program, where the team does morning run to keep fit, individual workouts and online discussions during this temporary suspension of sports.

For only Sh6,000 per person, one had the rare chance of enjoying a variety of wines from the South African wine company that crafts wine using the best grapes from Cape Town’s best vineyards, with the evening’s host being wine expert and sommelier Victoria-Mulu Munyoki.

Learning how to tell the flavours of wine just from tasting it and being able to tell which grape was used in making the wine is also key.	Ng'eyo mit mopogore mag kuong' e yor bilo, kendo fwenyo olemo mane otigo e loso kuong'no en gima duong'.
Identifying how sweet, dry or acidic wine is also helps in choosing the best bottle of wine.	Fwenyo mit, kech kata wach mar kuong' bende konyo e yiero chupa maber mar kuong'.
For the starter, we had grilled Octopus in tropical slaw and Mediterranean relish with a Durbanville Hill Collectors Reserve – ‘The Cableway’ chardonnay 2018, and chicken mishkaki in sugarcane speared chicken thighs with spicy peanut sauce with a glass of Durbanville Hill Collectors Reserve.

The second main course meal was grass fed fillet 200 grammes with local salad and mixed salts, accompanied with a glass of Durbanville Hills Collectors Reserve ‘The Promade Pinotage’ 2017.

Nonetheless, we choose to focus on the bright side of things. We are already planning on a possible rescheduling and gearing up for another event, Reggae in the Wild, already.

We were not about to make the same mistakes as others, ‘’ he boldly confirms.	‘’Newachano chiwo abuog rombe kod sabunde luoko lwedo ne jobuor nyasi moro ka moro.

‘’Since March, the situation has changed. With the Government imposed restrictions the playing field can be anticipated. Now, events are being held under these guidelines. Some event managers and establishments are following these rules while some are flaunting them. The enforcement of these rules is rather wanting as there are instances it may be construed to be selective. That said, there is a rise in exclusive events and people seem ready and willing to pay premium. Perhaps owing to the eagerness to escape the boredom of staying at home, ‘’ she concludes.	‘’Chakre dwe mar adek, chal oselokore.

The Kalasha Commission also introduced the Best Children category to fill in the gap of the growing need for children content.	Kamisen mar Kalasha bende ne okelo kidieny mar tuke nyithindo mondo opong dwaro mar gige nyithindo mamedore.
“From our Audience Development Strategy research, there has been a growing need for children content on our screens and as a result, the Commission introduced the Best Children Production category to acknowledge the producers who have developed concepts to accommodate our children as screen audiences,” said the Kenya Film Commission CEO, Timothy Owase.	“Kuom ratiro mag dongo jo nenowa, dwaro osebetie mar dwaro tuke nyithindo e TV kendo mano osemiyo kamisen golo kidieny maber mar nyithindo kendo mar fwenyo jogol tuke nyithindo,” Jatend Kenya Film Commission Timothy Owase, ne owacho.
“At the beginning of this year, it seemed as though Covid-19 would halt production and affect content creation altogether. However, our TV shows are on the rise and Kenyan films are being premiered on global platforms,” Owase remarked as he stressed the resilience of Kenyan filmmakers who have continued to make huge strides in these trying times.	“E chak higani, ne nenore ka gima Covid-19 ne dhi chungo golo tuke kendo chacho loso tuke.

How things fell apart for three Kenyan concerts this past weekend	Kaka gik moko ne ok odhi kare ne nyasi adek giko juma mokaloni
Ahealthy amount of financial mismanagement, poor security, artists mishandled, underage attendance - this concoction is what besieged Nai Fest this past weekend. 	Omenda mang'eny moselal, arita kuwe marach, tiyo marach gi jongolo, joyuoro matin - magi tee ne okedho budho mar Nai Fest giko juma mokalo.
A number of artists who were scheduled to perform did not take to stage, including Reekado Banks, who was set to headline the event.	Ng'eny jothum mane  onego gochi ne ok ogocho, nyaka Reekado Banks, mane owinjore otelne nyasi.
"And while socialite and event organiser, Bridget Achieng came out to blame the Government and curfew regulations, narrating in a post “The Government stopped the music, the main artiste (Reekado) could not perform, but revellers were happy."""	"E kinde ma jataa nyasi ma rahuma, Bridget Achieng ne owuok oko kendo chayo  piny owacho kod chike mag loro wuodhe, ka osomo andike ma omi duong' ni ""Piny owacho ochungo thum, jathum maduong' (Reekado) ok ne nyal gocho kata kamano joyuor nyasi to ne mor."""
"""It was past curfew the rules have to be followed,” Reekado’s team told another tale."	"""Ne en bang' seche moket mag wuodhe kendo chike nya luu” riuruok mar Reekado ne owacho e gano."
“The contract agreement was that Reekado was to be paid the remaining balance of his performance fee once he arrived in the country. The organiser was supposed to pay the remaining amount Sh540,000 on Saturday morning before Reekado would take to the stage later in the day,” a  member of Reekado Banks’ management team, who sought anonymity, revealed.	“Winjruok eyor andike newacho ni Reekado ne onego ochul balang' mag gocho ponono ne odonjo e kenya. Jataa chenro nonego chieng' ngeso gokinyi chul Reekado balang' mar Sh540,000 kapok nobiro chako gocho,” achiel kuom jokanyo matayo yore omenda mag Reekado,ne owacho ka ok en kod adiera.
Reports that an attendee died following injuries from Nai Fest during the weekend after a confrontation in unclear circumstances, is the boiling point of poor security measures to control an event.	Lupode mane okoyangore maber ni e giko juma jayuor nyasi moro ne owito ngimane bang' yudo inyruok Nai Fest en wach mawachore ahinya ewi arita kwe mag tayo nyasi.
A patient is said to have been brought in at Melchizedek Hospital along Ngong Road by a group of boys who later fled. 	Jatuono wachore ni noter kod rowere moko,mabende nodok, e hospital mar Melchizedek mayudore egeng' ndara mar Ngong.
With 3,800 tickets sold according to a Nai Fest management crew, the later reported number of 7,000 plus turn-out was remarkable, but over half the ticket sale ratio made into the venue.	Kaluwore kod jotelo mag Nai Fest otiko 3,800 ne ousi, bang'e kwan oganda mane onee moingo 7,000 ne gino maber mokalo kata kamano nus mag otiko emane ousi.
Multiple cases of day-light theft, rape, and underage being allowed into the party have overshadowed the event’s turn-out success.	Kwan jii mayuoro chenro oserocho timruok maber mag nyasi kaluwore kod kes mang'eny mag kuo odiechieng' alanga, bembo kod yiene nyithindo mapok oromo higni 18 donjo e nyasi.
“Even though I’m proud that the gig could do such numbers, it’s fair to say that it was poorly handled, and there was a lack of professionalism.” Caesar Obare, a member of the organising committee said to Pulse.	“Kata kamano amor ni thum ne nyalo kelo kwan jii marom kamano, ber wacho ni oknotaye maber kendo ne okoso rieko mar ng'eyo.” Caesar Obare ma en achiel kuom jokomiti mar tayo chenro ne owacho ne Pulse.
Forget professionalism, basic decorum, respect and diligence was so costly.	Ka iweyo koso ng'eyo rieko, chanruok , luor kod chir ok ne onere.
Too many cases of battery, assault and attempted robbery took the shine of stellar performances.	Kes mang'eny mag agoko, yenyo kod temo mecho oknomoro jothumbe mideo.
More incidents took the air out of the room but party-goers continued to enjoy themselves amidst the chaos. 	Timbe moko mang'eny ne otimore oko kata kamano joyuor nyasi ne odhi nyime kod nyasi maok odewo tulo go.
“I got robbed at NaiFest” quickly became a trend after influencer Shaq The Yungin opened the can of worms that then spewed on to many others sharing their experiences at the day time brunch gig.	“Ne okuala NaiFest” en wach manewachore gi jok mamoko mane nigi ng'eyo e wachno, e kinde thum mar odiechieng'  bang'   Shaq The Yungin kwedo timbe aila machal kod mago.
“You should be walking with a gang”, “You should buy a Glock”, “Sorry Shaq, Nairobi is crazy”, were the sentiments as friends and fans consoled with the embarrassed personality.	“Onego uwuoth e grup”, “onego unyiew Glok”, “Watimo mos Shaq, Nairobi osebiro marach”, ne gin weche mane osiepe kod joherane netimogo mos ne jogo mane osekale maundugo.
We were literally entering a den of thieves.	Newadonjo e dago mar jokuoye.
After the first Nai Fest, we thought they would have addressed the issues of the first edition, but we were wrong. 	Bang' nyasi mokuongo mar Nai Fest, newaparo ni oyudo giseloso ywak mokuongo, kata kamano ne ok en adier.
At a point, it felt like we were fighting for our lives. 	Nochopo kama nechalo ni wakedo ne ngimawa.
We went to a certain terrace that could oversee the event and you could just see the number of people who weren’t there to enjoy themselves, an anonymous attendee told Pulse.	"Jayuor nyasi ma ok noyang nyinge ne owacho ne  Pulse kama, ""Koa e pith newanyalo neno ji duto kendo newaneno ji mathoth mane ok ne yud mor e kinde nyasi."""
In a graphic video uploaded to Instagram, radio presenter Shaquille Oduk was bruised and battered explaining his ordeal of being ambushed as he was leaving the event.	E vidio mane oketi e Instagram nyiso kaka jalendo mar radio Shaquille Oduk ne oyudo gocho kod hinyruok e seche mane owuok e nyasi.
He lost his iPhone during the incident.	Kindego bende nowito simbe mar iPhone.
The lack of readily-available transport was a major issue leaving the crowd stranded and vulnerable.	Koso yudo yore wuodhe mapiyo nokelo pek ne oganda maqng'eny mane odiwo.
It was a thief’s heaven and that’s exactly what it turned out to be.	 Ne en mor jokuoge kendo mano ekaka nobedo.
“There was security hired, police did a sweep before the event, a partnership with Matter Hospital, but I think the organisation could do a better job at managing the events more thoroughly and ensure people’s safety,” Obare told Pulse.	“Nenitiere jo arita kuwe manoguel, polise mane obiro kapok nyasi ochakore, mane oriwore kod hospital mar Matter Hospital, kata kamano aparo ni riwruogno nyalo tayo maber nyasi kod keto arita maber mar kwee e kind oganda,” Obare ne owacho ne Pulse.
Gengetone Festival in Machakos caused an outburst from the performers due to non-payments and multiple no-shows.	Nyasi mar Gengetone manotimore Machakos ne okelo koko koya kuom jothumbe kaluwore kod koso chudo kod koso timruok nyasi mang'eny.
Complaints from artists made more headlines than the attempt at bringing together folks for a common good.	Ywak mag jothumbe ne omii pek moloyo yore riwo kanyakla jobuor nyasi.
First, it was Ex-ray of Boondocks Gang who led the rant-fest that acts could barely even make it to the event with basic riders not offered for performers.	Mokuongo grup mar Ex-ray of Boondocks Gang ema nochako goyo thum mane ok nyal dhi nyime matut e kinde ma jothum maoknoguel ema negocho.
“Respect artists.” He said in a long video. 	Ne owacho e bor vidiono ni,“Miuru jothumbe luor.”
The Gengetone act went on to apologize to fans that purchased tickets to watch them live, stating that he needed the cash to provide a livelihood for him and his family. 	Jathum mar Gengetone nodhi nyime kwayo joherane mane onyiewo otiko mar nene ka ogo thum ng'uono, ka owachoni ne oduaro omenda mar konyruok mare owuon kod mano mar joode.
Willis Raburu who was touted to be among organisers and made an appearance, and would later distance himself from the horror show.	Willis Raburu mane onee kaka achiel kuom jotaa nyasi, ne osudo mabor gi rochruok mane dhi nyime.
According to him, artists were cheated and outstanding balances are the reason as to why the event that stacked a line-up of Jua Cali, Mbogi Genje, VDJ Jones and many others to perform failed.	Kaluwore kode, jothumbe ne owuondi kendo balang' ema omiyo jothumbe mane okete e lai kaka Jua Cali, Mbogi Genje, VDJ Jones kod mamoko ne otamre goyo thum.
Furthermore, Kikwetu and Nai Fest have been poorly exposed for their ‘influencer-marketing strategy’ to sell tickets.	Ewi mago, Kikwetu kod Nai Fest osefweny yore magitiyogo maricho mag uso otiko.
The idea that influencers are crowd pullers is a myth.	En wach awach ni paro mag jogo manitiere kod huma madong'o yuayo oganda machieg'ni kodgi.
Kikwetu was fashioned to pull huge crowds, but it was false hype in reality despite artists’ dedication to put on a show. 	Kikwetu ne ober kaka mar yuayo oganda mang'eny, magadiera ne en owuora ka oweyo chuny mag jothumbe e chano  nyasi.
Out of the many cars in the Drive-Inn concert, a quarter were complimentary tickets and this was again the case intimated that over 500 influencers were hired to promote Nai Fest and a high number of attendants had tickets handed out to them by organisers and influencers.	Achiel kuom ang'wen mag weg nyamburko mane obiro e nyasi nenikod otiko kendo ne owachore ni jotieg weche 500 ne oguel mondo oland wach nyasi kendo kwan jii mang'eny mane oyuoro ne oyudo otiko kowuok kuom jotieg weche gi jotaa nyasi.
Pseudo posters promoting artists that would not come such as Migos were also employed.	Bende noket milome maonge wegi malando jothumbe mane ok nedhi yuoro kaka Migos.
Tanasha Donna’s management tells Pulse she pulled out a day before the gig because, despite her performance fee of Sh350,000 being discounted by Sh100,000, the organisers could not afford to pay her to use her image to promote the event.	Telo mar Tanasha Donna wachone Pulse ni ne othichre oko e giko odiechieng' mogik mar nyasi kata ne nengo goyo thum ne oduok chien koya sh350,000 nyaka Sh100,000 nikech jotaa nyasi ne ok nyal chule kuom tiyo kod pichane e lando nyasi.
“Tanasha had fans from Kisumu, Nakuru, Coast and all over pull through just to see her and then the Nai Fest guys pull a shady move last minute saying they do not have even a deposit. She had agreed to perform with half the figure, and get paid later with a contractual agreement to seal the same, but it wasn’t to be after Bridget shortchanged this.” The La Vie singer’s management told Pulse.	“Johera mag Tanasha mawuok Kisumu, Nakuru, Coast kod kuonde mamoko neoikore nene mak mana esaa mogik jo Nai Fest ne ochiwo buok bang' wacho ni nene tek mondo gichop kata chudo mokuong'o. Ne owinjore goyo thum komiye nus mar chudo kendo tieko chudo bang'e kaka winjruok mar orak lero kata kamano weche oknodhi kare bang' Bridget loko paro.” Telo mar jathum La Vie ne owacho ne Pulse.
Other artists that are said not to have performed including Sailors who quote a Sh350,000 tag to perform also backed out after being snubbed at the last minute. 	Jothumbe mamoko mawachore ni ok nogocho gin kanyakla kod Sailors mane ogoyo neng'o gocho mar Sh350,000 mabende saa mogik nothich oko.
While artists such as Boutross, Khaligraph Jones, and Otile Brown said to have gigged were paid the full amount.	E seche majothumbe mamoko mane ogocho kaka Boutross, Khaligraph Jones, kod Otile Brown wacho ni negiyudo chudo gi te.
The same bouncers hired to maintain order and a free-flowing event then became violent as things flared up backstage.	Bonsa mane oguel eketo arita kwee kendo etayo chenro e yoo makare ne olokore mager bang' rochruok chako bete kachien.
It’s no secret that an event doesn’t always go flawlessly perfect, Nai Fest 2 was however further desolated when it was reported that a female in rapper Gwaash’s entourage was harassed and beaten by security despite having a pass.	Oknyal pandre ni nitie nyasi moro amora ma okosetaaga eyo makare, Nai Fest 2 ne odong' nono bang' yudo lupot ni jakony jathum moro mamiyo, Gwaash ne osandi kendo ogo kod joket arita kwee kata obedo ni ne en kod.
Influencers associated with the event such as Fred Omondi responded harshly to backlash at the event’s incompetence with a now-deleted Instagram post.	Jataa nyasi Fred Omondi ne oduoko gi ich wang' rochruok mane obetie kaluore kod andika mane oketo e Instagram ma gi sani noseruchi.
He reiterated that it was the best event and the fans got premium value paying Sh2,000 for local acts rather than headliner Reekado.	Ne owacho ni nyasi neber moloyo kendo johera noyudo dhadhu mar omendagi mar Sh2,000 eneno thumbe magwa wawuon moloyo mago mag Reekado ma en jathum momi pek.
After the atrocious mishap that was Gengetone Festival the weekend prior, this was a moment of redemption for the events sector in particular but it now hangs in the balance after things transpired the way they did.	Bang' koso mor e nyasi ma ne otimre giko juma mokalo mar Gengetone, ma ne en thuolo mar chiero mor kata kamano wachni pod tek pimo bang' rochruok mano betie.
The event is planning a follow-up edition on a reported date of December 12th. 	Nyasi chano golo andike mar luwo kaka weche nobedo e odiechieng' ma ibiro landi tarik 12 dwe mar desemba.
Tanasha’s management, however, says they would not be interested in getting into business again.	Jotend Tanasha kata kamano owacho ni ok gibidwaro kendo timo kodgi ohala.
On top of that health security is a major concern according to fans that have been privy to these events.	Ewi mano, kaluore kod johera maosebedo kayuoro nyasi, arita kuwe makare en gino maduong' moloyo.
There is food, music, lights, everything, but masks and sanitization points.	Nitiere chiemo,ler,gimoro amora maok oweyo abuog rombe kod kuonde logo lwedo.
"""Corona lives in these events, and it’s hard to imagine how they market it as no mask, no entry yet no one gives a hoot on the grounds,” said a reveller Simon at Kikwetu."	"Simon ma en jayuor nyasi ne owacho ka entie Kikwetu ni, ""Tuo mar Corona yudore kwonde nyasigi, kendo tek paro kaka jotaa nyasi lendo maonge dewo, koso donjo e nyasi maonge abuog rombe,”"
Additionally, propaganda that Mo Sound went ahead and cut off the sound at Kikwetu, and that guys never even wanted to travel out of town for an event at Gengetone Fest because of Curfew regulations are some of the drama in these shows.	Kimedo, wachore ni Mo Sound ne odhi nyime kendo ng'ado thum Kikwetu, kendo joyuoro ne ok dwar wuotho oko mar boma e nyasi mar Gengetone Fest nikech chike kafiu mabende chalo kaka tuke e nyasigi.
Artists are short of stage-time in line with Covid-19 government protocol so the idea that you will get a fully-fledged show is something to consider when attending these concerts.	Jothum bende onge thuolo malach kaluwore gi chike mag Covid-19 ma sirkal oketo, koro paro ni ibiro yudo seche mang'eny e nyasi gi onego ipar ahinya saa ma idhi enyasigi.
The manner in which Nai Fest brand will reconcile the damage and losses to the affected will be a light step towards how serious showbiz events in Kenya can be judged.	Yoo ma nyasi mar Nai Fest biro losogo kethruok gi lal mosebedo ne joma ne oyudo chandruok biro bedo okang' mayot e yore minyalo pog go nyasi mag jothum mitimo Kenya.
This weekend, Thrift Social featuring Amapiano and Kwaito artist Samthing Soweto, will have to carry the events sector and prove Covid physical outdoor concerts can be pulled off Safe	Giko jumani, Thrift Social kanyakla gi Amapiano kod Kwaito artist Samthing Soweto, biro tayo nyasi kendo nyiso ni nyasi mar romo elaru ekinde mag corona nyalore eyo makare.
Spectacular night show returns to illuminate sky above Fort Jesus	Nyasi ma timoro gotieno oduogo kendo dhi medo ler e bor polo ma ni e wi Fort Jesus
The Mombasa night sky above Fort Jesus Museum exploded in a blaze of colour on Wednesday following the reintroduction of a spectacular pyrotechnics event. 	Nyasi mar Mombasa night sky above Fort Jesus Museum ne ochako gi moro chieng' tich adek kaluwore gi nyasi mar chier mar pyrotechnics.
A huge 270-kg firework display by Jay Pyrotechnics Ltd illuminated the dark skies and signaled the launch of the Fort Jesus Enchanting Sound and Light Multimedia Show.	Pilni mar mach maromo kilo 270 mane onyis gi kambi mar Jay Pyrotechnics ne okelo ler e mudho mane ranyisi mar yango chenro mar Multimedia kod duol mar Fort Jesus.
Pyrotechnics MD Jayshree Suchack said the 40-minute shows, which includes 3D projection mapping and holograms that depict Mombasa's rich history, will be held on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.

The illegal fishing gears were detained through enforcement patrols within Lake Victoria to curb indiscriminate fishing which has seen fish production in the lake drop.

The 45 illegal nets ranging from monofilament, undersize gillnets, mosquito seine nets and beach were torched at Kisumu pier to deter fishermen from the vice.

He said KCGS has enhanced patrols within the lake to enforce the law and ensure that prohibited fishing gears and methods are not exacerbated.	Ne owachoni KCGS osemedo patrol e aluora mag naam mondo oket chike kod neno ni gige lupo kod yore lupo ok okethore.
“Reports indicate that overfishing by organized crime syndicates in Lake Victoria could drive 76 percent of fish species to extinction,” he said.	“Lupode wachoni lupo mokalo wago molosi gi jomahundu manitiere Lake Victoria nyalo lalo atamalo 76 mag kit rech,” Ne owacho.
The use of illegal fishing gears, he added was also to blame for cases of fishermen being harassed by neighboring security agencies.	Lupo gi gik ma oklong'o, ne omedo ni emanyalo miyo jolupowa imonjo gi aritakuwe mag pinje libamba.
The DG called for collaboration with Beach Management Units (BMU) and court officials to eradicate illegal fishing in the lake.	DG bende ne okuayo riuruok mar duol mar Beach Management Units (BMU) kod apisa mag kot mondo otiek lupo mag akuo eyi naam.
Loonena cautioned the BMU’s against destruction of boats and fishing gears of others without following due process of the law.	Loonena bende ne ochiwo siem ne BMU kuom ketho yiedhi kod gige lupo ma ok giluwo ratiro mag chike.
“We have noticed criminal activities where some beach management units take the law unto themselves by destroying boats and nets of others,” he said.	“Waseneno timbe mag achije moko, sechema moko kuom jokanyo mag beach management units makao chik elwetgi kendo gi ketho yiedhi gi nede jomoko,” ne owacho.
He challenged the BMU’s to sensitize fishermen on changing and adapting sustainable modes of fishing to rebuild fish stocks in the lake.	Ne olieko ne BMU’s mondo otieg jolupo e yore mag lokruok kod yieruok e yore lupo mabudho mondo gi ger yuto mag rech e naam.

Prepare for another political betrayal, Kuria West Mp Robi	Ikri ne ndhoko machielo mar siasa,Prepare for another political betrayal, jaod bura ma Kuria Robi
As the window for political realignments narrows ahead of the 2022 general elections, bigger political parties are positioning themselves for the big seat, yet to be declared vacant after president Uhuru Kenyatta retires from politics.	Ekinde ma duond buche mag siasa chanre korieyo yiero maduong' mar higa 2022, duond buche madongo ikore ne telo madongo, mochiegni ket ayanga bang ker Uhuru Kenyatta weyo siasa.
The Jubilee Alliance affiliate party United Democratic Alliance (UDA) staunch supporters are however at cross roads, not knowing which side to throw their wait after their exit from the umbrella party.	Johera mag dound bura mar United Democratic Alliance (UDA) mowuok kuom Jubilee Alliance kata kamano, nikod kiawa kaluwore ni gikia koma gi siro bang wuok e duond bura maduong.
UDA’s Mathias Robby of Kuria West has however cautioned ODM party of a looming political betrayal, which he claimed is in the offing.	Joad bura ma Kuria West Mathias Robby maen ja UDA kata kamano ne osiemo duond buch ODM kuom ndhoko mar siasa maowacho ni ng'were.
Mathias said the opposition chief Raila Odinga should stay woke following his previous experience and make valid choices if he expects to win the presidential seat.	Mathias ne owacho ni jatend bura mabalo kod piny owacho Raila Odinga onego chieu kaluwore gi lonyne kendo otim yiero mongirore kapo odwaro kao kom ker.
The legislator while speaking at a burial within his constituency said the recent court ruling that declared the Constitution Amendment Bill (2020) null and void should be awake up call to Raila.	Jaod burano kane wuoyo eyik e constituency ne, ne owacho ni bura mane ong'ad machiegni mane okuedo loko mar chike (Constitution Amendment Bill (2020)) onego chieu Raila.
As Minority groups, he added, their interests were not captured in the document despite Uhuru and Raila vouching for it.	Kaka dhoudi matindo, ne omedo ni dwachgi ne ok oketi e andikago kata obedoni Uhuru kod Raila ne osirogi.
Mathias added that Raila should forget about any political endorsement or support from Mount Kenya region but should instead work towards gaining support from minority communities.	Mathias ne omedo wacho ni wii Raila onego wilgi rueko kata siro mar siasa koa gwenge mag Mount Kenya to onego may siro koa kuom dhoudi matindo.
Migori senator ,Ochilo Ayako while speaking at the same function, said that of importance to electorates at the moment is service delivery.	Seneta mar Migori , Ochilo Ayako kane wuoyo e nyasi nogono, ne owacho ni malichne jopiny en chopo singo mane omigi.

Sexual Gender Based Violence on the rise in Nyakach	Rocho ratiro mag terruok omedre Nyakach.
Residents of Nyakach in Kisumu County are questioning the existence of a gang that has continued to rape and defile locals at will.	Jodak ma Nyakach eyi kanti ma Kisumu penjo betie mar jonjore mosebedo kabambo kendo ketho ratiro mag jogweng'.
Horrific stories of the gang atrocities have been told over time and security authorities, according to victims have failed to act on information shared.	Mbekni mag jonjore makelo luoro osego kinde ka mang'eny kendo jochiu arita kaluwore kod joma neoyudo chandruok, pok otimo gimoro ewi wachno.
A non-state actor, Inuka Success Organization has been in the forefront to document cases of sexual gender based violence in the sub county.	Migao ma ok mar piny owacho mong'ere kaka Inuka Success Organization osebedo ong'ala ma nyime mar ndiko buche mag rocho ratiro mag terruok e sub kanti.
The organization coordinator, Victon Onyango, says they are a member organization of the Sexual Gender Based Alliance Kisumu County tasked with the responsibility to coordinate assistance to the survivors.	Jata riwruogno, Victon Onyango, wachoni gin jokanyo mag riuruok mar  the Sexual Gender Based Alliance Kisumu County mane omi ting mar tayo kony ne jokma osekalo etembe gi.
Onyango explains that during the documentation of the SGB violence in the area, it has come to their attention that the stories of the perpetrators are almost similar, an indication that it is a roaming gang.	Onyango lero ni kinde mane gindiko weche mag SGBV e gweng, oseyudore ni sigand achijego chiegni chal, ranyisi ni gin jonjore mawuotho ao yaye.
“It looks like a coordinated rape scenario, because we find similar cases happening same night, where people, two or three breaking into houses, they have same apparatus, torch knife,” he said.	Ne owacho ni“Ochalo bembo mochani, nikechi wayudo buche machalre ka otimore otieno achiel, kama jii ariyo kata adek turo ot kendo gin gi gik machalre kaka torch pala.”
A resident, Jared Ochieng, not his real name, due to the sensitivity of the case, narrates how the gang breaks into the house where his daughters were sleeping and in turn defiled them.	Jadak, Jared Ochieng, ok nyinge sie, kaluwore gi chal mar wachni, gano kaka jonjore ne oturo ot kma nyige ne ninde kendo bambogi.
“My daughters woke me at 2 am to report that some people gained entry into their sleeping room and defiled them,” he said.	“Nyiga ne ochiewo saa aboro otieno go lupot ni jomoko ne oturo ot mane gininde kendo bambo gi,” ne owacho.
Ochieng says he sought medical attention for his three daughters before pursuing justice.	Ochieng neowacho ni ne omanyo thieth mokuongo ne nyige adek kapok neomanyo ratiro mag chike.
His case is among many in the area where rapes, defilements are order of the day and night with no action being taken.	Buche chal gi moko mang'eny e kor gweng ma bembo, rocho ratiro en ng'iyo mapile kendo onge gima otime.
Ochieng noted that her daughters had recognized the voice of one of the perpetrators and police were given the information but little has been done.	Ochieng ne olieko ni nyige ne ofwenyo duond achiel kuom achijego kendo wach ne ochopo ne polis to gima tin manotimore.
“We did report to the police about one of the suspects who is a local, however, we were told to inform the police whenever we spotted the suspect, that sounds crazy,” says Ochieng.	Ochieng ne owacho ni, “Ne wago lupot ne polis ewi achiel kuom achije ma en jagweng, kata kamano, ne owachnwa ni wakone polis saa asaya ma mawaneno achijno, ne owinjore marach.”
For the cases that find their way into the courts, they get frustrated as suspects walk scot free after placing bonds and fines.	Ne buche machopo e doho, jok nitiere ka achich wuotho oko bang chulo bonds kod fwayi.
Onyango says they have followed a number of cases, some stuck in courts, but their ultimate goal is to ensure justice is served.	Onyango wachoni giseluwo buche mang'eny, moko podi omoko e doho, to lek gi maduong' en neno ni ratichgi oyudi.
“We just make sure that justice to the survivors is achieved, we also trace cases that have stalled and see why and the reasons behind the delay,” he said.	“Wadwaro mana neno ni ratich jomo osekalo e litni oyudore, kendo bende waluwo buche mosebudho kendo ng'eyo gima osemiyo gibudhi,” ne owacho.
The organization has conducted a number of awareness creations among the public on the need to report cases of sexual gender based violence.	Riuruogno osetimo kampen mag keto ng'eyo kendo ber mar goyo lupot mag rocho ratiro kod terruok ekind oganda.
“Most of the cases that we have been able to get currently are as a result of the conversations we have had in the community,” he said.	“Ng'eny buche mawasebedogo gi sani gin duoko mag twak mawasebedogo e gweng,” ne owacho.
The conversations have also targeted police officers and administrators in the community.	Twakgo bende osechimo apisa mag polis kod jondong gweng.
“Cases have been reported but surprisingly nobody follows these cases after they happened, they are reported and end that way,” said Onyango.	“Lupode osechiu makmana ni kuom hawi marach onge ng'ato maluwo buchegi bang timruok, igo dhok kendo girumo kamano,” Onyango ne owacho.
Kisumu Medical and Education Trust, (KMET) an indigenous Kisumu based non-governmental organization established to promote quality health and education services across the country has so far since March this year documented six cases of gender based violence within a village in Nyakach.	Kisumu Medical and Education Trust, (KMET) ma en NGO  osebudho Kisumu mane ochak mondo ochwal weche ngima kod somo maber epiny, kochakore due mar adek higani osendiko buche auchiel mag rocho ratiro mag jii e gwenge Nyakach.
Patricia Orao, KMET advocate in policy lead gender justice project says that in collaboration with Equality Now, they are determined to see the six cases go through the judicial process.	Patricia Orao, KMET en okil mar ratiro mag weche chenro mar gender justice wacho ni kagi riwore gi Equality Now, kendo gin kod kinda mar neno ni buche auchielgo okal e yore doho.
“We are taking police officers through capacity building in investigations because what happens if the investigation is shoddy, such cases always collapse,” she says	“Watere apisa mag polis e puonj mar mediro rieko eyore mag timo nonro nikechi gik matimore gin nonro morem, ma mang'enygi podho,” ne owacho.
Orao says the officers are being strengthened on documentations of evidence to be able to take to court water tight cases as a way of discouraging sexual gender based violence cases.	Orao neowacho ni apisa imedo rieko eyor ndiko weche aneno mondo gi bed kod nyalo mar tero kes motegno enyim doho kaka yoo mar tieko rocho ratiro mag terruok (sexual gender based violence).
A local chief, Elizabeth Achieng representing Agoro location, the epicenter of sexual gender based violence, says from October last year, the area has recorded a number of cases on gang rapes and defilements.	Chief, Elizabeth Achieng mar Agoro location, ma en chuny sexual gender based violence, wacho ni kochakore October higa mokalo,  gwengni osendiko kes mang'eny mag bembo.
Achieng says she had made emphasis during her routine public meetings that cases of defilement and rape should be reported immediately after seeking medical attention.	Achieng wachoni ne osejiwo oganda e barasa ni kes mag bembo kod ketho ratiro mag jii onego chiu lupodgi mapiyo kendo mgi manyo thieth. .
“I normally tell my people to report such cases to the authorities after the victims are taken to the hospitals for medication,” she says.	“Ajawacho ne jii mondo ogo dhok mag wechegi ne telo bang yudo thieth e osiptal,” ne owacho.
Locals in Nyabondo protest over poor health services.	Jodak ma Nyabondo ogomo ewi weche thieth mokowinjore.
Locals in Nyakach, Kisumu County, have staged a demonstration over poor health services at Nyabondo Mission Hospital.	Jodak ma Nyakach, Kisumu County, oseketo gomo ewi yore thieth moknikare Nyabondo Mission Hospital.
Carrying placards and twigs, the locals stormed the mission hospital alleging that the management had run down the medical facility.	Kagiting'o oboke, negi muomo mission hospital kagiwacho ni telono ne oseduoko kar thiethno piny.
Levy Hawi, a local, says the management of the hospital has deteriorated over time and it is time to fix the mess.	Levy Hawi, jadak, ne owachoni telo mar ospitandno osebedo kadok piny kuom kinde malach kendo en saa mar loso kethruok.
He says some officers have been looting the hospital without any shame at the expense of the sufferings of patients.	Owachoni apisa moko osebedo ka kualo osiptal maonge wich kuot ewi chandruog jotuo.
Hawi says patients are going without proper food despite being billed and the conditions of the wards are wanting.	Hawi wachoni jotuo dhi maonge chiemo malong'o kata obedo ni gi chudo kendo chal mar wards richo.
Speaking after failing to get an audience with the management at Nyabondo, Hawi says staff at the hospital are ready to work but the management is not ready to avail the required tools.	Kowuoyo bang koso yudo thuolo kod telo mar Nyabondo, Hawi wachoni jotich mag osiptal oikore mar tich to telo ok oikore mar golo gige tich maduarore.
He noted that most of the medical facilities are being bought from outside the hospital at the cost of the patients.	Ne olieko ni gige thieth mang'eny inyiewo oko mar osiptal ewi nengo jotuo.
Hawi says more often patients have failed to get treated due to lack of essential medical facilities.	Hawi wacho ni ng'enyne jotuo chando thieth nikech onge mag gige thieth mochuno.
The locals are calling for an overhaul of the management and a proper vetting of new management with capabilities to run the facility.	Jodak luongo lokruok mar telo kod puotho maber mag telo manyien man kod nyalo mag tayo osiptandno.
None of the management team was at the hospital when the locals stormed in to register their displeasure.	Onge jatelo moro amora mane nitiere e osiptal kinde mane ng'anyo mar jodak nochop mondo oket litgi.
Nyabondo Medical Training College Principal Juma who was also mentioned as those behind the failing of health standards in the facility dismissed the allegations.	Jatend Nyabondo Medical Training College, Juma, mabende ne oluongi kaka achiel kuom jok ma duoko osiptal chien ne okuedo wechego.
Juma says clan politics is at play and they will continue to discharge their duties as required despite the noise.  	Juma ne owacho ni siasa mag anyuola netugore kendo gi biro dhi nyime gi timo tijegi kaka duarore maok odeo koko.

He says more emphasis will be given to girls noting that those who will be selected will be given a monthly stipend.	Ne owacho ni jiipo mang'eny ibiro mii nyiri kolieko ni jogo ma ibiro yier ibiro mi gimoro matin due ka due.
Speaking to the press in his ward, Olwal called upon the youth who have completed class eight or form four to step out and apply for the short courses.

James Misanze, the facilitator of the organization, community progress youth empowerment institute says they are given hope to young people.	James Misanze, maen jataa riuruok mar, community progress youth empowerment institute wacho ni gi chiwo geno ne joma tindo.
Misenze says some youth dropped out of school may be due to school fees and the program is coming to support them.	Misenze wacho ni nitiere rowere moko mane oweyo skul nikech skul fis kendo koro chenroni biro miyogi kony.
He says the three courses they are offering will give the young people an opportunity to look for jobs elsewhere or start off their businesses.	Owachoni kidienje adek mag somogo magichiwo biro miyo rowere thuolo mag manyo tije kuonde moko kata chako ohandgi gi wegi.
Kenya reports progress in saving the northern white rhino with four new embryos produced	Kenya lando ondamo mar konyo kano kodhi mar northern white rhino kod kodhi ang'wen manoyudore.
Kenya announced Thursday that four new northern white rhino embryos had been produced as efforts to rescue the iconic giant land mammal from extinction gathered momentum.	Kenya ne olando chieng' tich ang'wen nikodhi ang'wen mag northern white rhino mane oyudore ne ogol kaka yoo mar konyo lee maduong kuom lal.
Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and a consortium of international scientists said the embryos were produced in March from 19 immature eggs (oocytes) that were harvested from one of the only two surviving female northern white rhino called Fatu.	Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) kod riuruok mar jotim nonro e piny ngima (international scientists) ne owachoni tonge mane ogol e due mar adek koa e tonge mapok oikore (oocytes) mane ogol kandalogi pok oromo koa  kuom achiel kuom northern white rhino ma mon ariyo miluongo ni (Fatu).
“We are excited with the laboratory outcome of the last ovum pick-up in March,” said Najib Balala, Kenya’s cabinet secretary for Tourism and Wildlife, in a joint statement issued in Nairobi. “With nine pure northern white rhino embryos now developed, the partners in the project should embark on the next phase of the project-embryo transfer to the surrogate southern white females at Ol-Pejeta conservancy.”	“Wamor kod duok moa kar pim ewi kodhi mogik mane ogol e due mar adek,” Najib Balala ma en jatend migao mar Tourism and Wildlife ne owacho, e lupot mane ochiwo Nairobi. “Gi kodhi ochiko maler mag northern white rhino mosedongi, jokanyo mag dongruok enego chak okang machielo mar  chiwo tongego ne lee machielo mar white rhino madhako mantiere Ol-Pejeta conservancy mondo oting ich.”
Kenya has partnered with an international consortium of scientists, conservationists to help produce the next generation of northern white rhino through assisted reproduction technologies.	Piny Kenya oseriwore kod duol mar rito kod timo nonro mag pinje mamoko (International consortium of scientists,conservations) eloso dak mar ngima mabiro mag Northern white rhino kokalo eyore manyasani mar nyuol.
The harvesting of immature eggs from the two surviving female northern white rhinos and artificially inseminating them using sperm frozen from deceased male counterparts has been ongoing since 2019 at Ol Pejeta Conservancy based in northwestern Kenyan county of Laikipia.	Golo tong'e nyuol mokomiyo koya kuom rhino mamiyo mangima kendo riwogi  kod tong'e nyuol madonjo kodgi koya kuom omuga marochere maosetho mawuok nyandwat, ne osechako dhi nyime koya higa 2019 kar keno mar Ol Pejeta mayudore yimbo mar nyandwat mar piny Kenya e kanti mar Laikipia.
KWS said that 14 out of the 19 immature eggs that were harvested from Fatu on March 28 produced four viable embryos after they were fertilized with thawed sperm from a deceased northern white rhino bull called Suni.	KWS ne owachoni 14 kuom 19 mag tong'e nyuol mokomiyo mane ochoki tarik 28 dwe mar adek koya kuom rhino miluongoni Fatu neochiwo iye ang'wen bang' riwogi kod tong'e nyuol mane owuok kuom Northern White Rhino marachar maneosetho mawuok nyandwat miluongoni Suni.
The four embryos are now stored in liquid nitrogen alongside the five ones that were created during earlier procedures as they await transfer to surrogate mothers to help produce new northern white rhino offspring.	Iye ang'wen go gisani okan e kido mar pii mar nitrogen kanyakla kod abich mane olos okang' mokuongo, kagirito ripo kod tong'e nyuol mag omuga mamiyo e konyo nyuolo nyithindo mag Northern white rhino.
Another milestone achieved in the rescue of northern white rhino was sterilization of a southern white rhino bull called Owuan in December 2020 to pave way for its role in helping determine the reproductive cycle of potential surrogate mothers without impregnating them.	Kedo moro mane ochopie e kony mar omuga marochere mawuok nyandwat ne en rochommar omuga marwath marachar mawuok milambo miluongoni Owuan e dwe mar desemba higa 2020, mane ochiwo thuolo mar fuenyo yore mag nyuol mag rhino mamiyo maok opong' iyegi.
KWS said that Owuan will be introduced to the southern white rhino females in the coming weeks to facilitate seamless transfer of embryos and produce new northern white rhino offspring.	KWS ne owacho ni e wige mabiro omuga mar Owuan ibiro riw kod omuga marochere mamiyo mawuok milambo e konyo riwo maonge rochruok tong'e nyuol mag nyuolo nyithindo mag Northern White Rhino marochere mawuok nyandwat.
“We are eager to get the progeny from the project that will guarantee survival of the species,” said Balala.	Balala ne owacho ni “Wan kod geno mar yudo jodong'o mar dong'ruogni mabiro konyo dak mag lee gi.”

The Regional commissioner, who was flanked by the Nyanza region and Kisumu County security teams criticized some people who are peddling lies about the covid-19 vaccine, saying the vaccine has been scientifically proven to be effective to boost body immunity and has no side effects,	Kamisona mar gweng'e go, manitiere achiel kod joarita kwee mar gweng'e mag Nyanza kod kanti mar Kisumu ne okuedo oganda mamoko mafuongo miriambo ewi chanjo mar covid-19, ka owachoni chanjo eyor nonro osepuodh bergi mar medo mijingo e del maonge rochruok mag del,

The wife of ‘killer cop’ Derek Chauvin followed through with her vow to divorce him today, insisting in a bombshell court filing that she doesn’t want a penny from the shamed ex-cop, DailyMail.com can disclose. 	Jaod  'janek' Derek Chauvin ne odhi nyime gi singo mar werruok kod kawuono, kojiwo ni ok odwar chudo bang werruok gi ja arita kue machon, DailyMail.com nyalo yango.
Kellie Chauvin, 45, said she was divorcing her husband of ten years due to the ‘irretrievable breakdown’ of their relationship.	Kellie Chauvin, maja higni 45, ne owacho ni owere gi chuore mosedak go kuom higni apar, kaluwore kod 'ma oknyal losi' e dakgi.
She also revealed the couple officially split on May 28 – three days after he’s accused of killing George Floyd by kneeling on his neck during a brutal nine-minute arrest.	Bende ne oyango ni ne giwere maler Mei tarik 28- ndalo adek bang' kan e wachore ni ne onego George Floyd eyor decho e kinde meko mare mane okao dakika ochiko.
Despite Kellie, a realtor, stating she is currently unemployed, the mom of two adult sons from another relationship said she did not want any money or financial assistance from Chauvin.

The couple met when Chauvin brought a suspect in for a health check before an arrest, returning to the hospital shortly after their initial meeting to ask her out.	Joot ne orado kane Chauvin okelo achich moro e thieth kapok omake, kane oduogo mapiyo bang romogi mokuongo kwayo mondo girom.

Disgusted Kellie kept her silence for several days as video of Chauvin’s brutal antics went viral, before releasing a statement Friday indicating that her sympathies lay with the victim and his family – not with her husband. 	Eyi chwanyruok Kellie ne oling' kuom ndalo mang'eny e seche ma vidio mar nek ne olandore, kapok ogolo lupote mar timo mos chieng' tich abich ne Floyd kod  anyuolane - to okne jaode

Chauvin was arrested and charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of Floyd.  	Chauvin ne omaki kendo ne ondikne ketho mar nek kendo temo nek e tho mar Floyd.
Kellie writes in the filing, obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com, that they called quits on their marriage one day earlier.	Kellie, e andikege, mane oyudi kod DailyMail.com, ni negise ketho kenygi odiechien achiel motelo.
‘The parties have been separated since May 28, 2020,’ it reads.	‘Jodak ne osepogore kochakre Mei tarik 28, 2020,’  ne ondiki.
‘There has been an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage relationship of the parties within the definition of Minn.

The filing explains that while Kellie was recently a realtor with Remax Results she is currently unemployed. 	Andikego lero ni kata bedo ni Kellie ne en jaus udi kod Remax Results gi sani oonge tich.
But it adds: ‘Petitioner is self-supporting, is not in need of spousal maintenance, and waives her right to receive temporary or permanent spousal maintenance from respondent’. 	To omedo ni: ‘jachwal kwayo nyalo konyore owuon, ok odwar kony mar jaode, kendo ok odwar ratiroge mag yudo kony makojolo kata manyaka chieng koa wuom jaode’.
She does, however, ask the court to award her ownership of the former couple’s two homes, one in the leafy Oakdale suburb of Saint Paul, and a second in Windermere, Florida. 	Ne okwayo doho mondo omiye ratiro mar bedo wuon mier ariyo mekgi, achiel yudore e leafy Oakdale suburb of Saint Paul, kod mar ariyo mayudore Windermere, Florida.
Both properties have been abandoned for days after they were surrounded by protesters and covered in graffiti. 	Udi ariyogo ne owe kuom ndalo bang jong'anyo ne oluorogi gi goro.
As part of a press push for her bid for the beauty contest Mrs. Minnesota America 2018, Kellie had raved about her husband, telling the St Paul Pioneer Press: ‘Under all that uniform, he’s just a softie.’ 	E siro yierone mar bedo e piem mar ber mar Mrs. Minnesota America 2018, Kellie ne omonjo jaode ka owachone jofwambo mag St Paul Pioneer Press: ni  ‘ni ebuo uniform, jaode muol.’
She also told the outlet how the shaven-haired ex-lawman was a major upgrade over her previous husband. 	Ne owachone jofwabo kaka jaod ma en jachiu arita ne oloyo chuore machon.
‘He’s such a gentleman. He still opens the door for me, still puts my coat on for me. 	‘En dichuo mamuol, kendo podi oyaona dhot kendo oruakona koti.
After my divorce, I had a list of must-haves if I were ever to be in a relationship, and he fit all of them,’ she said. 	Bang weruokwa, ne an kod kwan mar gik mochuno ang'I ka ochuno ni nyaka andoji e keny machielo, kendo oromo gi tee,’ ne owacho.

A shell-shocked relative told DailyMail.com that Kellie did not want to talk with the media and they did not want to stoke tensions further by speaking out on her behalf. 	Anyuola man nitiere kod luoro ne owachone jofwambo mag DailyMail.com ni Kellie ok ne dwar loso kod jofwambo kendo ne ok odwar medo luoro gi loso e loye.
Her attorney Ms Mason-Sekula added: ‘Ms. Chauvin is not providing any additional statements at this time.’  	Okil Ms Mason-Sekula ne omedo ni: ‘Mikayi Chauvin ok medi wach moro amora ekindegi.’
Chauvin was moved to one of the most secure prisons in the US Sunday night to ensure he won’t be murdered behind bars, DailyMail.com previously revealed.	Jumapil gotieno ne oter Chauvin  e jela morit maber US mondo kik nege ka en e jela, DailyMail.com ne ofwenyo.
In a highly unusual move, Chauvin, who is facing a murder charge in the death of George Floyd, was transferred late Sunday to Oak Park Heights Prison – Minnesota’s only Level Five maximum security facility.	E yoo mane okpar, Chauvin, ma ong'ad ne buch nek mar George Floyd, chieng' jumapil ne oter e jela maduong' mar Oaks Heights Prison –kar arita maduong' kende mayudore Minnesota.
He was previously at Ramsey County Adult Detention Center where he was on suicide watch, before being moved to the Hennepin County Jail because of COVID-19 concerns but then moved to the high-security prison. 	Mokalo  ne entiere Ramsey County Adult Detention Center kama ne ing'iye mondo kik odere, kapok ne otere e jela mar  Hennepin County nikech chich mag midhiero tuo mar COVID-19 kata kamano bang'e notere e jela manitiere kod arita man malo.
The Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) told DailyMail.com that Chauvin was transferred to prison and placed in ‘administrative segregation’ – solitary confinement – after a plea from the Hennepin County Sheriff. 	Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) ne owacho ne DailyMail.com ni Chauvin ne oket kar kende bang' kwayo mar Hennepin County Sheriff.
The 407-inmate prison boasts of never having had an escape and is also regarded as one of the country’s safest, having only had one homicide in its history.

Located on the border with Wisconsin, between the cities of Bayport and Stillwater, it accepts some of America’s most hated and high-risk inmates.	Ma ogo tong gi Wisconsin, ekind bombe mag Bayport kod Stillwater, okano jotuech moluor mogik mawuok Amerka.
Chauvin was due to appear in court on Monday but with Minneapolis still gripped by unrest the appearance was pushed back until June 8.	Chauvin ne onego chop enyim doho chieng wuok tich to nikech Minneapolis ne podi onge kue ne ochwal odieng nyaka June tarik 8.
Commissioner of Corrections Paul Schnell said Chauvin was moved to prison because of concerns about coronavirus and the huge influx of people being booked into Twin Cities jails on public order offenses. 	Kamisona ma chiwo kum Paul Schnell ne owacho ni Chauvin ne oter e jela nikech chich mag tuo mar korona kod pong mar jii misiko itero e jala mag Twin cities e makosa matindo.
‘First and foremost, we have a COVID situation. Second of all, a large number of people could be booked into Hennepin County Jail,’ Schnell said.	‘Mokuongo tik tik, wan kod midhiero mar Covid. Mar ariyo, ji mang'eny inyalo ter kar tuech mar Hennepin County Jail,’ Schnell owacho.
Privately though, law enforcement sources told DailyMail.com the move was to ensure Chauvin – now America’s most hated inmate – was not murdered behind bars. 	Gi thenge, jochiu arita moko ne owacho ne DailyMail.com ni timno ne en mar neno ni Chauvin – makoro en jatuech moluor mogik Amerka – ok ne onegi kilingling.
‘If he was in the general jail population he would probably be dead in two minutes,’ a source told DailyMail.com.  	‘Kaponi ne okete e jela monuando jii dikoro ne osetho gi dakika ariyo,’ ng'ato nonyiso DailyMail.com.
‘This is entirely for security purposes.’	‘Mae ne en mar arita kuwe.’
Chauvin will be held at the prison until next Monday when authorities face the daunting challenge of keeping his first court appearance in downtown Minneapolis shielded from further unrest.  	Chauvin ibiro mak nyaka wuoktich mabiro e seche ma telo nigi pek mar neno ni ochopo e nyim doho e boma mar Minneapolis kendo gengo tulo manyalo wuok.
It’s highly unusual to lock defendants up in prison before they have been convicted, however officials did something similar in the case of disgraced Minneapolis officer Mohamed Noor who shot dead a woman in 2017 while responding to her 911 call.	Tek mondo ilorne achich mapok ong'ad buche, kata kamano apisa ne otimo gima chalo kamano e buch Mohamed Noor kane onego miyo moro e higa mar 2017saa mane oduoko simo mar 911.
Across the country, protests and riots have broken out as demonstrators protest against police brutality and racism, amid a backdrop of a country that had already been shaken by economic uncertainty and public health fears caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

The president did not appear publicly on Sunday to address the rioters, who have engulfed the perimeter of the White House as well taken to the streets in several other U.S. cities, he did weigh in on Twitter, claiming that governors need to activate the National Guard in their states.	Chieng' jumapil Ker ok nowuok ayanga wuoyo gi jong'anyo, mane oluoro White House kendo mane ng'anyo e bombe mamoko mag U.S., nowuyo e yor Twitter, ka owacho ni gavanas ochier yore arita e gwenge gi.
He lauded the improvements over the weekend in Minneapolis, Minnesota by the National Guard’s presence – and while the demonstrations have appeared less violent since they started at the end of last week, police in the city said they discovered Sunday caches of homemade firebombs around the city.

The Pastoralist Leaders Forum, which comprises of governors, MPs, CSs and PSs and speakers of county assemblies, on Monday said members had unanimously resolved to throw their weight behind the BBI process.	Pastoralist Leaders Forum, moriwo gavana, jood bura, jotend migepe kod jogoro kod spikni mag od buche ma kaonti, chieng' Wuok Tich ne owacho ni jokanyo ne oyiere siro BBI.
The leaders had last week identified 10 areas that they wanted to be amended but have since narrowed them down to three.	Jotelogo, juma mokalo nofwenyo gik moko 10 magi dwaro mondo olosi kendo ne gi duokogi piny nyaka adek.
CS Yatani, the group leader, said former Prime Minister Raila Odinga assured them that their concerns would be addressed.	CS Yatani, ma en jatelo, ne owacho ni Prime Minister machon Raila Odinga ne osingo negi ni dwachgi ibiro chopi.

I can confirm to you that we have been deliberating on the matter and we have now resolved to support the BBI in totality.	Anyalo wachonu ni wasebet kawaparo wachni kendo waseyiere siro BBI gi chunywa.
We want to thank President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga for having a special place for us in this matter,” said Yatani after a meeting with Raila at a Nairobi hotel.	"Yatani ne owacho kama bang' romo kod Raila e otel Nairobi, ""Wadwar goyo erokamano ne Ker Uhuru Kenyatta kod Prime Minister machon  Raila Odinga kuom winjo ywak marwa.”"
The leaders agreed to form a technical committee that will liaise with the BBI team to address their concerns.	Jotelogo ne owinjore loso kamiti mabiro riwore kod tim mar BBI e chwalo dwachgi.
The three issues they said would be extending the Equalisation Fund for 20 years, establishing the Livestock Marketing Authority and deleting proposed amendment on Article 203 (1) of the Constitution on revenue allocation.

Concerns identified earlier but were dropped include securing and protecting the 290 existing constituencies, making Senate the Upper House and doing away with the proposal to create the Health Service Commission.	Paro moko mane gin godo to ne giweyo gin kaka rito od buche 290 mane nitiere chon,  keto Senet bedo od bura mamalo kendo diro oko kwayo mar loso kamison mar weche mag ngima.
Raila said the three concerns raised by the pastoralist communities would be adequately addressed.	Raila ne owacho ni ibiro chop dwaro adek mane oket kod oganda mapidho jamni.
The issues will be taken on board. 	Dwachgi ibiro ket e wago.
"""The technical team will sit down and look at them,” he assured."	"Ne osingo niya, ""Jolony biro bet mondo ong'igi.”"
Raila added that it is important to address the issues of concern raised by pastoralist communities if their potential is to be unlocked.	Raila ne omedo ni owinjore mondo ochop dwach ogandano kapo ni idwaro fweny nyalogi.
“Pastoralist areas are rich in resources and have the potential for tourism and other businesses. Infrastructure is also critical in these areas because these regions have been subjected to marginalisation for a long time,” he explained.	Ne olero kama, “Gwenge mag pith jamni nitiere kod nyalo mang'eny mag dongruok kod ohala. Yore mag dongruok bende dwarore e gwengego ma osebedo ka idiyo e pok mar mwandu kuom ndalo mang'eny.”
He added: “We are reading from the same page and talking the same language. Each and every Kenyan is equal.”	He added: “We are reading from the same page and talking the same language. Each and every Kenyan is equal.”
“It is important for us to ensure that we prepare for the event. Even if we have our own differences, we should not wash our dirty linen before our visitors,” said a senior ODM official.	"Ofisa moro maduong' mar ODM ne owacho niya: “Nyaka wane ni waikore ne nyasini. Kata obedo ni wan gi weche e kindwa, ok onego wa mo wechego e nyim wendwa."""
And it is those differences that the ODM chief wants to address before the national event even as they begin preparations for next year’s General Election.

At the weekend, signs that the disagreements in Raila’s camp are far from over played out after Orengo launched fresh attacks on his critics within the ODM camp.	Ne onenore maler e giko Juma ni ywaruok pod ng'eny e pati mar Raila. Mano ne onenore ayanga sama Orengo ne ochako  okidhore kendo gi Jo ODM mosebedo ka kwede.
"Orengo, who is said to be among lawyers approached by Raila to challenge the stoppage of the BBI initiative by the High Court, said leaders only turned to him ""when things are thick""."	"Orengo ma en achiel kuom okinde ma Raila ne owuoyogo mondo otam Doho Mamalo geng'o chenro mar BBI, ne owacho ni jotelo ne obiro ire ""ka weche osemoko."""
The Siaya Senator has been at loggerheads with some ODM top brass over the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020.	Orengo ma en Seneta ma  Siaya ochwanyore gi jotelo madongo moko mag ODM e wi wach timo lokruok moro ne Chik mar Kenya kata Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020.
He voted in favour of the Bill.	 Orengo ne oriwo lwedo wachno moketo ombulu mare ni otim lokruogno.
Orengo claimed some ODM leaders were riding on the party successes without knowing how they came about.	Orengo ne owacho ni jotend ODM moko chamo luch joma nosetiyo matek ne patino. Gikia lwenje ma ji nokedo mondo patino ochung' kaka ochung' sani.
"""When the party is in turmoil, everyone looks for me asking for my whereabouts, but during the other days, they undermine my capability,"" said Orengo."	"Orengo ne owacho niya:  ""Sama weche tek, ji te manya, to sama weche okuwe, ji ochaya."""
He told his critics to focus on helping Raila clinch the presidency.	Ne owacho ne joma kwedego ni gima onego obed ni gitimo sani en konyo Raila mondo oyud telo mar Ker.
"""It does not matter what we all want now, our focus should be on the presidency... Ambitions can appear easy but getting what one wants is never easy."""

A cold relationship between other Raila’s foot soldiers who are having ambitions for similar political seats in the region also risks splitting the party.	Gimachielo manyalo pogo pati mar ODM en monruok mantie e kind jopatino malaro kombe mag siasa kuonde ma giwuokie. En wach matek nikech kata obedo ni ok gin jotelo e patino, giriwo Raila lwedo ahinya kendo gimako kama duong'.
There are fears that some of the politicians may ferry goons to boo their opponents during the national celebrations, like was the case when Raila convened a meeting early this year in an attempt to rally his troops for the BBI process.	Giluor ni moko kuom josiasa nyalo ting'o ji kowuok kuonde maboyo mondo gibi gikel fitina e nyasino. Mano e gima notimore e chak higani kane Raila oluongo chokruok moro kotemo jiwo joge oriw lwedo chenro mar BBI.
During the meeting at Ciala Resort, a section of the attendees booed Mbadi. And this is what some ODM insiders fear could play out, should the leaders fail to come together before the national event.

Yesterday, Raila snaked his way to his Riat home with a lean motorcade, evading journalists, with sources saying that he has planned a series of activities in Kisumu this week.

Despite the woes in the ODM party, Raila is optimistic that the several projects that have been undertaken that the president will unveil will breathe life to the region’s economy.	Kata obedo ni  tungni ng'eny e ODM kamano, Raila mor ni chenro mogwaro mag dongruok ma osebedo kadhi nyime e alworano biro kelo dongruok maber kuno.
Yesterday, contractors tasked with delivering some of the projects were still racing against time to complete the word ahead of the national celebrations.	Nyoro, moko kuom kembe ma ne omi tijego ne ringo koni gi koni mondo gitiek tich kapok nyasino ochopo.
The facilities include a road project leading to the Sh350 million Jomo Kenyatta Sports ground, which will host the event.	Gik ma ilosogo oriwo ndara madhi Jomo Kenyatta Sports Ground mokawo milion 350. Nyasino idhi tim kuno.
Others are the rehabilitated Sh3 billion port.	Gik mamoko oriwo pot ma yande okethore to olos manyien, mokawo bilion 3.
The revival of the Kisumu-Nakuru meter gauge railway line is among those that the President is expected to unveil after Kenya Railways workers completed its rehabilitation.

The move is expected to avert a bitter fallout within Deputy President William Ruto’s camp.	Nenore ni okaw okang'no mondo ogeng' sigu manyalo bedoe e kind joma riwo William Ruto lwedo.
In a Facebook post, Kuria disclosed that he made the decision following a meeting with the DP Ruto on Sunday.	Kuria ne owacho e Facebook ni ne ong'ado mar timo kamano bang' bedo gi romo moro gi Ruto chieng' Jumapil.
The PEP party had settled on Raymond Kuria to face off with United Democratic Alliance (UDA) candidate John Njuguna Wanjiku in what threatened to split the Hustler nation.	Pati mar PEP ne oseyiero Kuria mondo olar kom gi  John Njuguna Wanjiku mawuok e pati mar  United Democratic Alliance (UDA) ma kendo wachno ne pogo jo  Hustler nation.
“PEP's message of hope and renewal was endorsed by the voters of Gaturi ward in Murang'a on December 15, 2020, and Juja constituency on May 18, 2021.  We wanted to present this message for approval by the people of Kiambaa constituency on the July 15 [by-election],” said Kuria.

However, this did not go down well with my colleagues, particularly [Mathira MP] Rigathi Gachagua and [Kikuyu MP] Kimani Ichungwa. 	Kata kamano, jowetena Rigathi Gachagua [ Jabunge ma Mathira] kod Kimani Ichungwa [Jabunge ma Kikuyu MP]  ne ok mor kata matin gi wachno.

"Kuria ne omedo wacho niya: “Akwayo Jo Kiambaa gi jo PEP duto mondo ong'wonna nikech ang'eyo ni okang' ma akawoni ok bi morogi."""
To make my two colleagues happy and above all for the unity of the Hustler nation, PEP will not be fielding a candidate for the Kiambaa by-election.	Mondo amor osiepena ariyogi, to moloyo, mondo warit winjruok mar Hustler nation, PEP ok bi keto ng'ato mondo olar kom e yiero matin ma Kiambaa.
There is a perceived simmering supremacy battle in the Tanga Tanga camp as MPs from Mt Kenya allied to the DP jostle to be in Ruto’s inner circle based on their perceived influence of the region.

Kuria said PEP is a member and stakeholder in the Hustler nation alongside Johnson Muthama-led UDA, Mwangi Kiunjuri-led The Service Party (TSP) as well as the Omingo Magara-led People's Democratic Party (PDP).

Attorney General Paul Kihara Kariuki during the launch of State of the Judiciary Annual Report (SOJAR) , January 23, 2020	Paul Kihara Kariuki, ma en  Atoni Jener, kata Attorney General sama ne ichako State of the Judiciary Annual Report (SOJAR), Januar, tarik 23, 2020.
When the Court of Appeal sits to hear the cases filed by President Uhuru Kenyatta, ODM leader Raila Odinga, Attorney General Kihara Kariuki and the electoral commission, seven issues stand out.	Ker Uhuru Kenyatta, Jatend ODM  Raila Odinga, kod  Kihara Kariuki ma en Atoni Jener  kaachiel gi migawo mar yiero oriwore motero kes moro achiel ne Doho mar Apil. Sama dohono winjo kesno nitie weche abiriyo mabiro dwarore ni onon matut:
If the court is to allow the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) juggernaut back on the rails, the judges will first be determining whether the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) had quorum to verify the signatures submitted by the BBI proponents.	Chenro mar Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) koretek kendo iye otwere. Kapo ni doho oyie mondo chenrono odhi nyime, mano nyiso ni giyie ni kwan mar jo  Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) ma ne opwodho seyi mag joma ne dwaro dwaro BBI ne oromo.
This question transverses the appeals filed by both the IEBC and AG.	Wachni mulo weche ma IEBC kod Atoni Jener e doho.
The commission argues that the question on whether two or five commissioners can legally run the institution was determined by another court and could not be reopened.	IEBC wacho ni doho machielo ne oseng'ado ka be owinjore gi chik mondo  komisona ariyo kata abich oti e lo IEBC, kendo wachno ok onego oter e doho machielo kendo.
On one hand, IEBC argues that in the first case, determined by Justice Wilfrida Okwany, the minimum commissioners vary.	Komachielo, IEBC wacho ni e kes mokwongo ma Jang'ad Bura, Wilfrida Okwany ne ong'ado, kwan matinie mogik mar komisona manyalo tiyo e lo IEBC pogore pogore.
Meanwhile, High Court Judges Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Chacha Mwita, Teresiah Matheka and Jairus Ngaah held that the commission should have five commissioners.	To koni, Jong'ad Bura mar Doho Mamalo, Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Chacha Mwita, Teresiah Matheka kod Jairus Ngaah oramo ni IEBC nyaka bed gi komisona abich.
It faults the five judges, arguing that the section they relied on to find that IEBC had no quorum was earlier on declared unconstitutional by a separate court.	IEBC wacho ni Jong'ad Burago oketho, giwacho ni chik ma gitiyogo e ng'ado ni IEBC ne onge gi komisona moromo kane gipwodho chenro mar BBI  en chik ma ne oyudo oseruch gi doho machielo motelo.
“The learned judges of the Superior Court erred in law in finding that IEBC lacks the requisite quorum for purposes of carrying out its constitutional and statutory mandate yet paragraphs five and seven of the Second Schedule to the IEBC Act, upon which the finding was premised on had been declared unconstitutional by a judge of equal jurisdiction,” IEBC appeal papers read.	Otese ma IEBC ywakgo e kot wacho niya: “Jong'ad Bura ma omi luor mag Doho Mamalo ne oketho chik kuom wacho ni IEBC onge gi komisona moroma mondo gitim tich ma Chik ma Kenya omiyogi ratiro mar timo. Ok uluwo chik nikech weche mutiyogo e ng'ado kamano, ma gin weche mayudore e paragraf mar abich kod mar abiriyo mar kidieny miluongo ni Second Schedule e Chike Matayo IEBC kata IEBC Act, noyudo oseruch gi jang'ad bura machielo ma ne nigi migawo kaka maru.”
“A contrary finding on the issue of quorum had been arrived at by another judge of concurrent jurisdiction.”	“Jang'ad Bura machielo ma nigi migawo kaka margi  ne owacho gima opogore e wi kwan mar komisona madwarore.”
On quorum, the AG argues that the High Court went beyond what had been asked and in turn, the IEBC has been rendered useless as it can no longer operate.	E wi wach kwan mag komisona manyalo tiyo, Atoni Jener ne owacho ni Doho Mamalo ne okalo tong' mi koro gimiyo IEBC obedo riwruok maonge tich kendo ok nyal timo gimoro amora.
His contention is that the commission cannot even conduct voter registration and which it was faulted of not doing in preparation of a referendum.	Gima wang'o iye en ni koro IEBC ok nyal kata mana ndiko nyinge joma dwaro lwaro ombulu. Kae to ji keto ketho kuom IEBC nikech ok otimo kamano mondo oik ji ne refarendam mabiro.
“The orders issued by the High Court were so extensive and revolutionary that they go to the very foundation of the Constitution. They were beyond the matters that were before the court,” Solicitor General Ken Ogeto argues.	Ken Ogeto ma en Okil ma Konyo Atoni Jener kata Solicitor General, ne owacho niya: Bura ma Doho Mamalo ong'ado omulo gik mang'eny ahinya, okelo lokruoge madongo dongo kendo oyiengo mise mag Chike mag Kenya.”
Another issue which the court is being asked to determine is whether the court erred by reversing an exercise which involved a consultative process including the Judiciary.	Wach machielo ma idwaro ni dohono ong'i en ka be dibed ni dohono ne oketho chik kuom loko chenro ma ne oriwo jomang'eny nyaka Kidieny mar Sirkal Mochung'ne Chik kata Judiciary.
According to the AG, the court illegally placed itself at the centre of the Constitution-making process.	Atoni Jener wacho ni Doho ne otimo marach kuom miyore migawo mar loso chik.
He argues that means each time Kenyans want to amend the Constitution, they will have to get back to the court to ask it which parts to amend and which ones to leave.	Owacho ni okang' ma Doho okawono nyiso ni kinde moro amora ma Jo Kenya dwaro timo lokruok moro e chik, nyaka gidhi e dohono mondo onyisgi kuonde ma ginyalo loko e chik kod kuonde ma ok ginyal mulo.
In effect, the learned judges decreed that whenever the people desired amendments to the Constitution, it would be imperative to seek the guidance of the court in advance to determine the changes that are, or are not amendable.	E yo machielo, jong'ad burago wacho ni kinde moro amora ma ji biro dwaro timo lokruok moro ne chik nyaka gikwong gi gidhi e dohono mondo onyisgi motelo gik minyalo lok, kod ma ok nyal lok.
"""This risks transforming courts into policymakers, thereby usurping the people’s freedom to determine the terms of the social contract and how they wish to change those terms,” he continues."	"Ne omedo wacho niya, ""Ka weche odhi nyime kama, ibiroga los chik e doho, kendo doho biro mayo raia ratichgi mar wacho kaka onego oloch e wigi kendo timo lokruok e chike ma oyudo gisewinjoree."""
The AG is also contesting the court’s decision on the involvement of President Kenyatta in the BBI process.	 Atoni Jener bende kwedo bura ma ne kotno ong'ado e wi kaka Ker Kenyatta odonjo matut e chenro mar BBI.
He argues that owing to perennial polls battles, three million Kenyans who signed on the document, majority county assemblies and the two Houses of Parliament ratified the president and ODM’s plan to end the violence and marginalisation.	Owacho ni nikech lweny mosiko e kinde yiero, Jo Kenya milion adek ma ne oketo seyi e chenrono, ng'eny Ute Bura mag Kaunti, kod Kidienje ariyo mag Od Piny Owacho ne oriwo lwedo chenro mar Ker kod ODM mondo gitiek mahundugo kendo gitiek wach buono jomoko.
“The above process is geared towards national reconciliation which constitutes a legitimate national political process. The process is supposed to pre-empt perennial election-related violence and marginalisation and it’s imperative that it be concluded before the next general election,” the court papers also read.	Barupe moter e kot bende wacho niya; “Chenro miwuoyoeno, en chenro midwaro ni okel winjruok e piny Kenya. Omiyo owinjore gi chik mondo josiasa oriwe lwedo. Chenrono onego olos weche makeloga mahundu kod buono ji masiko bedoe kinde yiero kendo wadwaro ni otiek chenrono kapok yiero maluwo ochopo.
He argues that President Kenyatta cannot be faulted for promoting peace. According to him, the finding by the High Court that he had breached Chapter Six of the Constitution is not supported by evidence.	Owacho ni ok nyal wach ni Ker Kenyatta oketho nikech omanyo kaka kuwe dibedie.
According to him, the finding by the High Court that he had breached Chapter Six of the Constitution is not supported by evidence.	Owacho ni gima Doho Mamalo wacho ni Ker ne oketho chik namba auchiel e Chik mar Piny, en gima ok nyal sir.
The other issue is whether the Constitution has clauses that cannot be amended.	Gimaduong' en ni; Be en adier ni Chik mar Kenya nigi weche ma ok nyal lok?
On this, he accuses them of skewed, slanted, incomplete and erroneous reading of available academic work on the subject and of Kenya’s constitutional history and the making of the Constitution of 2010.	Owacho ni jong'ad burago ne ok otiyo gi chik kaka dwarore sama ne ging'ado kesno. Ne gitiyo kod chik e yo mobam mondo onenre kagima chik siro gima ok adier.

Senate Minority Leader James Orengo has hit out at his critics in the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), saying they only seek his help during crisis.

"Orengo, who is said to be among lawyers approached by ODM leader Raila Odinga to challenge the stoppage of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) initiative by the High Court, said leaders only turned to him ""when things are thick""."

The Siaya Senator has been at loggerheads with some ODM top brass over the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020. He voted in favour of the Bill.

However, succession politics in ODM and the fight for political positions in Nyanza in 2022, are said to have caused a wedge.	Kata kamano, gie sani weche ok dhi maber e kindgi nikech piem madhi nyime e patino. Ji laro kombe madhi bet nono e ODM kod  kombe mamoko magNyanza e yiero ma 2022.
On Saturday, Orengo who spoke during a burial of former South East Alego MCA Joshua Osuri in Alego Usonga sub-county in Siaya, accused unnamed politicians in ODM of abandoning the party leader Raila, during his times of need or crisis moments.

Referring to the recent Bonchari by-election, he accused unnamed CSs of using their powers to frustrate the 'handshake' and the ODM party.

Deputy President William Ruto on Saturday launched a broadside against the government's borrowing plan, saying the ballooning foreign debt was a threat to the nation.	Jalup Ker, ne okidhore gi sirkal e wi chenro mar sirkal mar holo pesa, kowacho ni gowi masiko medore ma Kenya nigo nikech holo pesa mang'eny turi kuom pinje ma oko, biro mwomo Jo Kenya kendo weche ok bi dhi maber.
Speaking after a two-day retreat with Coast leaders and professionals, Dr Ruto said if elected president, he would reduce the country’s debt burden.	Bang' bedo gi romo mar ndalo ariyo gi jotelo kod jotich mosomo ma Nam Chumbi, Ruto ne owacho ni ka oyiere mondo obed Ker mar Kenya obiro dwoko chien gowi ma Kenya nigo.
“Instead of borrowing, we will enhance and expand our savings. Borrowing is threatening our nation,” said Ruto after receiving an 18-point economic blueprint from coastal leaders.	Ruto ne owacho niya bang jotelo mag Nam Chumbi miye chenro margi mar dongruok ma ne oting'o gik moko 18 ma gidwaro ni otimnegi, “kar holo pesa kowuok oko, wabiro kungo pesa mang'eny e yo maber. Holo pesa tero pinywa kama rach.”
The DP did not say how his administration would finance the multi-billion shilling projects in the blueprint. 	Jalup Ker ne ok owacho kama sirkande dhi goloe pesa mar chopo dongruok ma jo Nam Chumbi dwaro kendo madhi kawo bilionde mang'eny.
He, however, promised to sign a charter with the Coast on the agreed plan.	Kata kamano ne onyisogi ni obiro keto seyi e winjruok moro mobiro timo gi jo Nam Chumbi mapwodho chenrogo.
In his new political plan targeting regional blocs, Ruto said he would negotiate with people in former eight provinces and develop plans to unshackle the nation from chains of poverty.	E chenrone manyien momanyogo ombulu e kidienje mag Kenya ma yande iluongo ni provins, Ruto wacho ni obiro wuoyo gi joma odak e alworago mondo gilos chenro mabiro golo piny Kenya e twech mar dhier.
He said Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok would coordinate all the “hustle nation activities.”	Ne owacho ni Josphat Nanok ma en Gavana ma Turkana ema biro tayo chenro mag “hustler nation.”
After the Coast, the DP is scheduled to meet leaders from Nairobi before heading to Western.	Bang' romo gi jo Nam Chumbi, Jalup Ker chano mar romo gi jotelo mag Nairobi kae to odhi Western.
“We must establish a charter. I’m ready to sign a charter with the people of Coast on what needs to be delivered during my administration,” declared Ruto in Kilifi.	"Ruto ne owacho niya ka en Kilifi: “Nyaka watim winjruok. Aikora keto seyi e winjruok ma abiro timo gi Jo Nam Chumbi e wi gik ma sirkanda biro timonegi."""
Yesterday, a section of Coast leaders tabled 18-wish list of demands they said would form the basis of the charter or covenant between the region and the DP.	Jotend Nam Chumbi nyoro ondiko list mar gik moko 18 ma gidwaro ni otemnegi. Giwacho ni listno e mise mar winjruok mibiro tim e kind jo Nam Chumbi kod Jalup Ker.
The economic plan dubbed, The Coast Regeneration Plan, touch on revival of collapsed factories, blue economy, value-additions, special economic zones, tourism and agriculture.	Chenro mar dongruokno mabende iluongo ni The Coast Regeneration Plan, oting'o weche kaka; chiewo kendo kembe mag loso gik moko ma yande osepodho, ohala mag nam, medo bero gik mayudore e alworano mondo okel ohala momedore sama iusogi, keto chike mag ohala ma bet ok oridre ahinya mondo oywa jo ohala, bero ohala mar welo mabiro bayo, kod loso weche pur.
"""These big issues were broken into 18,"" said former Kisauni MP Ananiah Mwaboza who once served as constitutional advisor to the office of the deputy president. "	"Ananiah Mwaboza ma en Jabunge machon ma Kisauni ma kinde moro ne nigi migawo mar ng'ado rieko e wi weche motudore gi chik e ofis mar jalup ker wacho ni ""Weche madongogi ema ne wasonyo mochopo 18."""
The plan appeared to borrow heavily from the 2030 economic blueprint developed by Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani in 2015.	Nenore ni chenrono okawo weche mang'eny mayudore e chenro mar dongruok ma 2030 ma ne olos gi Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani e higa mar 2015.
Ruto said it would be subjected to public participation.	Ruto ne owacho ni ibiro mi raia thuolo mar neno chenrono kendo chiwo pachgi.
Former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar said the Coast would support Ruto's presidential ambitions on certain terms which he has committed to meet.	Hassan Omar ma en Seneta machon ma Mombasa ne owacho ni jo Nam Chumbi biro goyo ombulu ne Ruto mondo obed ker mana ka oyie ni obiro timonegi weche moko ma ginyise.
"""We will cascade it down to villages. It will be a people's plan. We are happy tha the DP wants to become president on certain terms. In the last three days, we have come up with the plan for the Coast,"" said Omar."	"Omar ne owacho niya: ""Wabiro tero chenroni ne ji duto nyaka ei mieche. En chenro ma oriwo oganda duto.

Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa said Coast people would organise how to be part of the team that provide solutions for problems facing the region.	Aisha Jumwa ma en Jabunge ma Malindi ne owacho ni jo Nam Chumbi biro timo chenro mondo giriwre gi joma biro chiwo paro e wi kaka inyalo tiek chandruoge ma ji yudo e alworano.
"""We want partnership. We will partner with you and see whether you will met all our demands and if you do so, we will be with you all the way,"" said Jumwa."	"Jumwa ne owacho niya: ""Wadwaro joma wanyalo tiyogo kanyachiel. Wabiro riwore kodi kendo wabiro neno ka ibiro chopo gigo duto ma wakwayi, to ka itimo kamano, wabiro riwi lwedo nyaka giko."""
Lunga Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani said the economic plan presented to the DP was work in progress, addding that it had left out key areas like ports and harbours.	Khatib Mwashetani ma en jabunge ma Lunga Lunga ne owacho ni chenro mar dongruok ma ne omi jalup ker pod ibiro medie weche mamoko. Owacho ni chenrono ne oweyo oko gik madongo monego otimie dongruok kaka pot mogwaro kod kuonde mamoko ma meli nyalo gowoe.
"""I did not hear anything about the Shimoni Port, which is what the people of Kwale want. I hope the DP will implement it once he is elected,"" said Mwashetani."	"Mwashetani ne owacho niya; ""Ne ok awinjo gimoro amora e wi Pot ma Shimoni, to potno ema  jo Kwale dwaro. Ageno ni jalup ker biro losonwa potno ka oyiere mondo obed Ker."""
The DP said the economic plan was not final as it would be subjected to public participation.	Jalup ker ne owacho ni chenro ma ne omiyeno ok oting'o weche duto. Oganda pod biro chiwo pachgi kae to imedoe gik mamoko monego otimie dongruok.
“A lot of input must come from the people. The plan will be taken to the wards and villagers because it is about them and not us politicians,” said Ruto, who met 12 elected MPs from Coast.	Ruto ma ne oromo gi jobunge 12 mag Nam Chumbi ne owacho niya, “Nyaka mi oganda thuolo moromo mar chiwo pachgi. Ibiro ter chenrono nyaka e  ward kod mieche. Nikech en chenro mar raia to ok mar josiasa.”
Others present during the meeting in Kilifi were a section former MPs and professionals. Conspicuously absent from the process was Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya.	Moko kuom jobunge machon kod jotich mosomo ne nie chokruok ma ne otimore Kilifino. Kata kamano, Salim Mvurya ma en Gavana ma Kwale to  ne onge e chokruogno.
None of the other five governors from the Coast attended the retreat.	Kuom gavana mamoko abich mag alwora mag Nam Chumbi, onge kata achiel ma ne nie chokruogno.
Governors have cried foul over increased impeachment motions against them by Members of the County Assemblies and upheld by the Senate, even as they called for fair trial.	Gavana mogwaro ywak ni Jo Od Bura ma Kaunti siko donjonegi kendo Senet rwako wechegigo. Gikwayo ni onon weche midonjonegigo kaka owinjore ma ok gi nindo konchiel.
The Council of Governors (CoG) also lamented over the threshold of impeaching governors, saying that oversight bodies had watered it down.	Council of Governors (CoG) kata riwruok mar  jo Gavana ywak ni idonjone jogavana gi weche matindo tindo. Giwacho ni joma owinjore ochung' ne jogavana ok ti kaka owinjore, gisemiyo ji thuolo mar donjo ne jogavana kod weche mag oyuma.
In a statement read by CoG vice-chairperson James Ongwae, the governors said they would seek to establish the right threshold for impeaching county bosses.	James Ongwae ma en jalup jakom mar riwruok mar jogavana ne owacho ni gidwaro yango maler ketho mapek minyalo donjnego jotelo mag kaunti.
They said the threshold of removing other holders of public office such as MPs and those of the County Assembly was seemingly higher than that of governors.	Owacho ni ketho minyalo golgo jotij sirkal mamoko kaka jobunge e tich, gin ketho madongo ahinya kopim gi ketho minyalo golgo gavana e tich.
“The threshold for the impeachment of governors is becoming lower. We are getting into situations where procedural and administrative duties that don’t fall under the governor are actually impeachable,” he said.	Ne owacho niya: “Kaka kinde medo sudo e kaka imedo donjne gavana gi weche matindo tindo. Wasechopo kama inyalo donjne gavana gi weche ma ok otudore gi tije. Ginyalo bedo chenro moro monego oluw ma ok otudore gi tij gavana kata wach moro monego ochung'ne ma ok en migawo mar gavana.”
The current process, they claimed, is political and had turned governors into victims of their respective county assemblies and the Senate.	Giwacho ni siasa ema chiko gik matimore sani, kendo Jo Od Bura gi Senet timore gi jo gavana kaka gidwaro.
Oversight bodies must remain cognizant of the legal principles surrounding impeachment so that the exercise is not abused, said the Kisii governor.	Ongwae ma en gavana ma Kisii ne owacho ni riwruoge mochung'ne jogavana onego ong'e chike ma tayo gik minyalo donjnego gavana mondo ji owe tiyo marach gi chenrono.
They said they would seek to be enjoined in the case by former Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud challenging his removal.	Ne giwacho ni gibiro timo kinda mondo oluw chik e kes ma Mohamed Abdi Mohamud ma yande en Gavana mar Wajir otero e kot kotamore ni ne ogole e migawone ma onge gimomiyo.
Yesterday, it also emerged that Mohamud and the sworn-in Governor Ahmed Ali Muktar addressed the extraordinary CoG meeting separately and gave their account of happenings in the county.	Nenore ni nyoro Mohamud kaachiel gi Ahmed Ali Muktar manyocha ochamo muma mar donjo e ofis Gavana ne owuoyo e chokruok makende mar CoG. Ne giwuoyo e kinde mopogore opogore, kendo moro ka moro kuomgi ne olero makore e wi gik matimore e kauntigino.
While Muktar joined the meeting virtually, Mohamud was physically present at CoG headquarters at Delta House, Nairobi.	Muktar ne oriwore e chokruogno e yor intanet. Mohamud to ne odhi e chokruogno achiel kachiel. Chokruogno ne otimore e ofis maduong' mar CoG man Delta House, Nairobi.
Both were then excused to allow the council members to deliberate on the matter as each argued that they were legally in office, one through a court order and the other through a gazette notice by Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka, after a successful impeachment process. 	 Ne okwa ji ariyogo mondo owuog e chokruogno mondo jowetegi onon wachno, nimar moro ka moro kuomgi ne oramo ni en gavana mar kauntigi kaluwore gi chik.  Achiel ne wacho ni en gavana nikech doho owacho kamano, to machielo wacho ni en gavana nikech Ken Lusaka, ma en Jatend Senet ne oriwo lwedo weche ma Jo Od Bura ma kauntigi ne odonjonego Mahmud mogole e migawono kendo nolando wachno ne oganda koluwo chenro ma sirkal oketo.
The Sunday Standard has learnt that the county bosses will move to court this week to seek an interpretation on what happens as well as the threshold for impeaching governors.	 Sunday Standard  wacho ni gavana mag kaunti biro dhi e doho jumani mondo olernegi gik matimore kendo oyangnegi maler weche minyalo donjnego gavana migole e kom.
While protesting what they termed a worrisome trend, the CoG cited the impeachment of former governors Mike Sonko (Nairobi) and Ferdinand Waititu (Kiambu) as other instances where governors have seemingly been persecuted.	CoG ne owacho ni gik mosebedo ka timore ne jogavana chando chunygi, kuom ranyisi, giwacho ni gik ma ne otimore ne gavana mamoko machon kaka Mike Sonko ma ne en gavana ma Nairobi kod Ferdinand Waititu ma ne en gavana ma Kiambu, nyiso ni   isando jogavana.
"""While we appreciate the fact that impeachment is both legal and a political process, the rule of law should prevail while undertaking the same,"" said Ongwae."	"Ongwae ne owacho niya: ""Wayie ni donjone gavana en gima oluwre gi chik kendo en gima omulo siasa. Kata kamano, chik mar sirkal ema owinjore oti e wachno."""
"He disclosed, “The council shall engage relevant institutions with a view to streamlining court pronouncements with the law so that the impeachment process can be anchored in legitimacy and impartiality."""	"Ne owacho niya; “Riwruokwa biro tiyo gi riwruoge mamoko mondo wane ni weche ma doho ng'ado luwre gi chik kendo weche duto motudore gi  donjone gavana osir gi chik, ma ok gileng'ore konchiel."""
The county chiefs underscored the need for all bodies involved to be guided by the Constitution and principles laid down by the courts on the threshold of impeachment.	Jotelo mag kaunti ne owacho ni chenro duto minyalo tigo e donjone gavana onego ota gi Chik mar Kenya kaachiel gi weche ma doho oyango ni inyalo donjnego gavana.
The governors claimed MCAs have turned into 'lynch mobs' and sent three governors home, while one survived as other mooted the same, just this year.

"""The council assures the public that it values integrity and accountability in the running of public affairs in the counties. Nevertheless, oversight bodies must remain cognizant of the legal principles surrounding impeachment so that the excise is not abused,"" urged CoG."	"CoG wacho niya, ""Riwruok mar jogavana wacho ne oganda ni gidwaro ni joma sirkal oketo mondo ochung' ne kaunti obed joma ratiro, kendo giikre dwoko wach e wi migawo moro amora ma gichung'ne.

They spoke after a virtual conference called to deliberate county issues. The CoG is expected to meet next week to deliberate on the matter further.	Ne giwuoyo bang' chokruok moro ma ne gibedogo e yor intanet ma ne gitimo mondo giwuo e wi weche ma mulo kaunti. CoG onego orom kendo juma mabiro mondo giwuo momedore e wi wechego.
Their address comes days after CoG chairman Martin Wambora termed Mohamud’s impeachment and his deputy’s takeover rushed.	Ne giwuoyo ndalo manok bang'  Martin Wambora ma en jakom mar CoG wacho ni joma ne ogolo Mohamud e kome kendo keto jalupne kare, ne orikni.
The former Wajir boss moved to court a day after Senate okayed his removal from office, as initiated by the Wajir County Assembly.	Jatelo ma Wajirno ne otero wachne e doho mana ndalo achiel bang' Senet yie ni ogole e tich kaka Od Bura ma Wajir ne dwaro.
The new Wajir governor was sworn in despite a court order that barred the same.	Gavana manyien ne ochamo muma kendo okawo komno kata obedo ni doho ne ogolo chik ni mano kik timre.
Senate found him to have grossly violated the constitution, which was one of the charges he faced before the august House.	Senet ne oyudo ni ne oketho chik sirkal e okang' malach, kendo mano en wach achiel ma ne Jo Od Bura odonjonego.
It acquitted him on a charge of abuse of office.	Ne ging'ado ne bura ni ne ok otiyo marach gi telo ma ne omiye.

He added, “Let us win this Rurii Ward by-election by 99 per cent so that those outsiders (UDA) trying to come here can be taught a lesson. Nyandarua is our home. If we lose in Rurii, I should just resign. How can Jubilee lose this seat in Nyandarua, and I am the Majority Leader?”	Ne omedo niya, “Walouru yiero matin mar Rurii Ward gi pasent 99 mondo wami joma ooko (UDA) matemo donjo kae puonj.

In a dramatic about-turn, Kimunya says he will not bear the consequences of a matter that rests in another constituency.	Kimunya olokore kendo owacho ni ok nyal kume nikech gik motimore e konstichuensi machielo.
“Many things have happened within the political circles. Rurii Ward, Bonchari and Juja constituencies have new representatives.

“We only have about 12 months before the next election. They do not have much time and the only way they can win the hearts of people to get to work immediately,” he said.	Ne owacho ni, “Wadong' mana gi dweche 12 kama mondo otim yiero machielo. Gin gi kinde manok omiyo ginyalo mana miyo ji ogen-gi ka gichako tich sani sani.”
He said on whether he has to resign from his position as majority leader after Jubilee failed to deliver in the three by-elections, he will have to do more consultations.

“I did not consult the people of Kipipiri and this is a fundamental decision that needs public participation. I doubt they would let me bear the consequences of matters that rest in another constituency. I believe the matter rests there and we move on with congratulating the winners and living situation that people have made their choice and we must respect that choice,” he said.	“Ne ok awuoyo gi jo Kipipiri e wi wachno, to en wach mapek madwaro ni oganda ochiwie paro.

Magi timore to komachielo joma chiegni gi ker wacho ni Ker Uhuru Kenyatta iye owang' ahinya gi kaka iloyo patine e yiero mogwaro mosetimore machiegnini.

The President is said to have read the riot act to some top Jubilee officials for reportedly bungling the Juja and Rurii campaigns.	Wachore ni Ker ne osiemo mager moko kuom jotend Jubilee, kowacho ni gin ema ne gimiyo kampen mag Juja kod Rurii ok odhi maber.
Involvement of civil servants, especially from Harambee House, was reportedly also discussed, with politicians in the president’s inner circle blaming the power wielders for using brute police force, occasioning a protest vote.	Wachore bende ni Uhuru ne owuoyo gi josiasa ma en go machiegni e wi kaka  jotij sirkal, ahinya ahinya mawuok Harambee House, ne ochiko polise mondo oked mager gi raia momiyo gigoyo ombulu ne pati machielo mondo ging'any ne sirkal.

While addressing the Press on Wednesday, he said there was more to his reaction that was captured in the video clip.	Sama ne owuoyo gi Jofwamb weche Tich Adek, ne owacho ni nitie gik mane oyudo osetimore ma vidiono ok onyiso.
"The county chief noted that the video did not show the beginning of the incident where he was trying to ask ""the commissioners eligible questions."""	Jatend Kauntino wacho ni vidiono ok nyis kama weche ne ochakorego kopenjo “komisona ma ne ni kuno penjo ma ne owinjore gidwok.”
He said he tried getting answers to the questions but his opponents did not want to hear any of it, hence causing the commotion.	Owacho ni ne otemo yudo dwoko mag penjone to komisonago ne ok dwar winje. Mano ema ne okelo tungni.
“The clip does not tell it all. I had asked a simple question to the IEBC officials before our opponents started a shouting match.

Nyoro claimed that not all votes from two polling stations where the Jubilee candidate had a strong showing were counted raising concerns of attempt to rig the by-election.	Nyoro ne owacho ni ne ok okwan ombulu duto ma ne owuok kuonde yiero ariyo ma ne jo Jubilee ng'enyie ahinya, kendo mano ne miyo ji paro ni gitemo kelo mibadhi e yiero matinno.
He claimed that votes from Gachororo and Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology were thrown in the field, raising alarm.	Owacho ni ombulu ma ne owuok Gachororo kod Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology ne owit e pap ma ne omiyo ji ochich.
"“We were not involved in any chaos. We all know who are violent in nature. People are busy tarnishing my name for no reason. I condemn in the strongest terms possible the insinuation that I'm a violent person. I have never been violent even during my campaigns,"" he said."	“Ne ok wakelo tungni moro amora.

Chebukati blamed Nyoro for disrupting the tally of votes at Mang'u High School that saw the process resume yesterday morning.	Chebukati wacho ni Nyoro ne ochocho  kweno ma ne timore nyoro Mang'u High School, ma omiyo okwen kendo kawuono.
The county chief however said he will wait for conclusion of investigation into the matter and promised to accept the outcome of the by-election. 	Kata kamano, jatend kauntino wacho ni obiro rito mondo otiek non wachno kendo owacho ni obiro riwo lwedo dwoko mowuok e yierono.

Former Kiambu Governor William Kabogo, who was campaigning for Jubilee's Susan Njeri Waititu also congratulated George Koimburi of little know People's Empowerment Party (PEP) allied to the Deputy President and Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria.

"""As one who has been honored to serve the people of Kiambu county as former governor and previously as a long serving MP for Juja constituency, i believe that we must now put the divisions of the campaigns behind us and pursue a common goal of uplifting and serving the people,"" urged Kabogo."

This is the second time Sudi has failed to stop the criminal case.	Ma en kinde mar ariyo ma Sudi osetemo chungo kesneno, to otame.
In the High Court, Justice Hedwig Ong’udi ruled that the prosecution did not violate the rights of Sudi when he was charged with forging academic certificates while seeking clearance from the electoral commission to contest in the March 4, 2013 elections.

Jotelo ang'wen-go osewacho ni digiher chung' mondo gikaw kom mar Ker, mano nyiso ni yiero ng'ato achiel kuomgi mabiro ting'o bendech patino ok dhi bedo mayot.
The leaders have in the past hinted at bringing onboard more key figures to craft a formidable outfit for the succession battle.	Jotelogo ne owacho kinde mokalo ni gibiro kelo josiasa madongo dongo e patigi kendo mano biro miyo ng'wech mar laro kom mar ker ok bi bedo mayot.
Some of the principals have separately held consultative meetings with other political players, including ODM leader Raila Odinga.	Moko kuom jotelogo osewuoyo e kinde mopogore  gi josiasa mamoko moriwo jatend ODM Raila Odinga.
At the same time, the leaders commended Senate for ratifying the impeachment of Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud on Monday.	Gie kindeno, jotelogo ne opwoyo Senet kuom golo  e kom Mohamed Abdi Mohamud ma yande en Gavana ma Wajir. Ne ogole Wuok Tich.
They said that was a bold step in the fight against corruption and impunity.	Ne giwacho ni mano ne en okang' motegno e kedo lweny mar tieko mibadhi.
Gideon and Wetang’ula were among the 25 senators that voted in support of the impeachment Motion and sealed the fate of the governor.	Gideon kod Wetang’ula ne gin moko kuom seneta 25 ma ne ogoyo ombulu ma ne siro kwayo mar golo gavanano e kom,  okang' ma ne gikawono ne otieko wachno.
The leaders expressed dissatisfaction with the High Court judgement that declared the Building Bridges Initiative null and void, putting an injunction to the referendum through the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020. On Covid-19, the leaders expressed concern over reports of a potential fourth wave in July.	Jotelogo ne owacho ni ok gimoro gi bura ma  Doho Mamalo ong'ado ni chenro mar Building Bridges Initiative en chenro ma chik ok osiro kendo ok nyal tiyo, mi gigeng'o ni kik tim refarendam kuom tiyo gi chik mar  Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020. To e wi wach Korona, jotelogo ne owacho ni onego okaw mapek ripode ma wacho ni wanyalo bedo gi kidieny mar angw'en mar masirani e dwe mar Julai.
They called on the Ministry of Health to intensify mass testing and vaccination to mitigate any possible devastating effects of the pandemic.	Ne gikwayo Migawo mar Thieth mondo omed kinda mondo gipim ji mang'eny kendo gimi ji mang'eny chanjo mondo masira mar Korona kik hiny ji mang'eny ahinya.
The leaders urged relevant authorities to urgently put in place measures to curb destruction caused by flooding.	Jotelogo ne okwayo jo sirkal ma nigi migepe mag konyo e weche ataro mondo otim kamano.
They also called on the government to fast track the distribution of subsidised seeds and fertiliser to farmers to take advantages of the ongoing rains.	Ne gikwayo sirkal mondo otim chenro mondo okow ne jopur mapiyo piyo kodhi kod manyiwa ma sirkal odwoko nengogi chien, mondo jopur oti kodgi kinde ma koth chueni.
Chaos erupted at Mang’u High School tallying centre, Juja constituency after allegations of vote-rigging in the by-elections emerged.	Tula ne omuoch kar kwano ombulu ma Mang’u High School, man e konstichuensi ma Juja bang' wach wuok ni ikwalo ombulu.
This prompted police to contain the situation by sending away politicians present.	Mondo polise okuwe weche ne ochunogi riembo josiasa ma ne ni kuno.
Kiambu Governor James Nyoro, Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata, Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria and Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro were among the politicians who were kicked out by the police.	Moko kuom josiasa ma ne polise oriembo ne gin; Gavana ma Kiambu James Nyoro, Seneta ma Murang’a Irungu Kang’ata, Moses Kuria ma en jabunge ma Gatundu South kod Ndindi Nyoro.
It was a disorderly scene with chairs disarranged and papers scattered on the floor as rowdy politicians and their party agents made their way out of the centre.	Bar ne oyowni kuno sama josiasa ma rori kaachiel kod joma ne ochung' ne patigi mopogre opogre wuok kar kwenono. Kombe ne owit koni gi koni otese bende ne okere e dier ot.
Kiambu Governor James Nyoro was on record in one of the videos making rounds on Social media demanding a fair vote tallying process.	E vidio moro ma ji kowo e intanet, Gavana ma Kiambu James Nyoro wacho ni nyaka to kwan ombulu kaka owinjore.
“We are not fools, and we have made our point,” he said in the video as an unknown voice in the background supported his sentiments.	E vidiono, owacho niya; “Ok wafuwo,  wasenyisou gima wadwaro” to koni dwol moro ne riwe lwedo gichien chien.
It is the chaotic behaviour that prompted the police to take charge and restore calm in the constituency’s tallying station.	Tungnino ema ne omiyo polise okawo okang' mar kweyo weche  kar kwenono.
The tallying process was suspended for some time as politicians, their supporters and party agents were kicked out of the tallying centre under the command of Kiambu County Commander Ali Nuno.	Ali Nuno ma en Kamanda ma Kiambu Kaunti ema ne ogolo chik mondo oriemb josiasa, joma riwogi lwedo kod joma ochung' ne patigo. Nikech mano, ne ochung kweno  kuom seche.
This comes hours after political parties alleged intimidation in the three by-elections that took place in the country on Tuesday.	Wechegi ne timore mana seche matin bang' pati mag josiasa wacho ni polise ne osando jopatigi e yiero matindo adek ma ne otimore Kenya Tich Ariyo.
The country had by-elections in Bonchari and Juja constituencies as well as Rurii ward.	Kenya ne otimo yiero matindo  e konstichuensi mag Bonchari kod  Juja kaachiel gi ward ma Rurii
The three by-elections have been marred by chaos and allegations of intimidations by the police.	Yiero adekgo ne obedo gi tungni kendo wachore ni polise ne osando ji maonge gima omiyo.
Earlier, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party and ODM had said their candidates and agents were facing intimidation by the police.	Pati mar United Democratic Alliance (UDA) kod pati mar ODM ne oyudo osewacho ni joma chung' gi otiko mag patigi kaachiel kod joma tiyo ne patigi ne isando gi polise.
Deputy President William Ruto has called on leaders to be discrete when initiating constitutional changes.	Jalup ker William Ruto osebedo ka wacho ne jotelo ni onego gi ti gi rieko sama gikwayo mondo otim lokruok ne chik.
His sentiments come days after a five-judge bench of the High court nullified the BBI process.	Ne owacho wechego mana odiechienge manok bang' jong'ad bura abich mag Doho Mamalo ketho chenro mar BBI ka giwacho ni ok oluwre gi chik.
Speaking from his Karen residence, Dr Ruto hinted at a possibility of leaders coming up with an agreement that he says will bring the country together.	Dr Ruto ne owuoyo ka gima jotelo nyalo loso winjruok moro manyalo riwo piny kendo omi ji odag gi kuwe. Ne owacho wechego ka en e dalane ma Karen.
“We should have an agreement that creates a path for Kenyans to work together even as we compete,” he said.	Ne owacho niya; “Kata obedo ni wapiem, onego wabed gi winjruok mamiyo Jo Kenya oti kanyachiel.”
The country’s second in command also urged leaders to put the interests of Kenyans first adding that the country was facing serious challenges that needed to be addressed.	Jalup ker ne ojiwo jotelo ni giket motelo weche manyalo konyo Kenya nikech gie sani, Jo Kenya nyagore gi pek mang'eny kendo owinjore okonygi.
Deputy President William Ruto, who has openly challenged the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 since its inception expressed gratitude to a higher power, moments after the shocking ruling.	A e chakruok, Jalup ker William Ruto ne okwedo ayanga wach loko chik  kata Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020. Omiyo ne odwoko erokamano maduong' ne jong'ad bura ma ne oketho chenrono mana dakika matin bang' lendo ma ne obwogo jino.
“There is GOD in heaven who loves Kenya immeasurably. May GOD'S name is praised forever,” he tweeted in response to the High Court judgement.	Kane owinjo lendo mar Doho Mamalono ne owacho niya e intanet; “Nitie NYASAYE e polo mohero Kenya matamre ginono. Opak nying NYASAYE nyaka chieng'.”
The One Kenya Alliance has registered its dissatisfaction with the High Court judgment on the BBI Constitutional Amendment Bill.	Pati mar One Kenya Alliance owacho ni ok gimor gi kaka Doho Mamalo ong'ado kes mar BBI kata BBI Constitutional Amendment Bill.
Its principals Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi, Moses Wetangula and Gideon Moi said Kenyans should, however, be patient and wait for the appeal process to proceed to its logical conclusion.	Jotelo mag patino ma gin; Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi, Moses Wetangula kod Gideon Moi ne owacho ni Jo Kenya onego ohore mos kendo girit apil mosemak odhi nyaka giko.
The High Court last week annulled the BBI referendum process throwing the future of the initiative into uncertainty.	Juma mokalo, Doho Mamalo ne oketho chenro mar refarendam mar BBI mi giweyo weche chenrono e mudho.
A bench comprising Justices Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Teresia Matheka and Chacha Mwita upheld a consolidated case by eight petitioners that the constitution bears essential features on its basic structure that cannot be amended.	Jong'ad Bura ma ne oriwo, Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Teresia Matheka kod Chacha Mwita ne oyie gi kwayo mar ji aboro ma ne wacho ni nitiere gik moko e chik mag Kenya madwarore ahinya kendo ok nyal lok.
The court held that the BBI secretariat and steering committee had failed to provide critical information to the public as outlined in the procedures to amend the constitution through a popular initiative.	Kotno ne owacho ni joma ne ochung' ne chenro mar BBI kod komiti ma ne chwale ne ok onyiso raia weche mochuno kendo madongo kaka onyis e chike matayo kaka owinjore olok chik kapo ni itime kaluwore gi kwan mar joma dwaro ni oloke.
The court also observed that the president cannot initiate a process to change the constitution in the pretext of promoting national unity.	Dohono ne owacho ni chik ok oyiene Ker loko chik mar piny. Omiyo ok nyal yiene kata ka owuondore ni gima odwaro timo en mana kelo winjruok e piny.
But the four principals expressed hope that the appellate court will uphold the sovereign will of the people of Kenya.	Kata kamano, jotelo ang'wen-go ne owacho ni gigeno ni dohono biro timo gima Jo Kenya dwaro.
They spoke after a meeting on Tuesday.	Ne giwuoyo bang' chokruok moro ma ne gitimo chieng' Tich Ariyo.
The meeting, they said, was aimed at receiving an update report from a technical committee on the progress made in formalising the Alliance.	Ne giwacho ni chokruok ma ne gitimono ne en ni mondo omigi ripot e wi chenro ma dhi nyime mar neno ni chenro mag patigi duto luwre gi chik mondo sirkal opwodhe.
They expressed satisfaction with the progress so far, noting that Kenyans were waiting anxiously for the same as a vehicle that carries their aspirations.	Ne giwacho ni gimor gi kaka weche ne dhi, kendo ni Jo Kenya rito gi siso mondo otiek chenrogo nikech patino biro chopo dwachgi mag kinde mabiro.
The Principals also expressed concerns over reports of a potential 4th wave of the COVID-19 in the month of July, calling upon the Ministry of Health to intensify mass testing and vaccination to mitigate against this danger.	Jotelogo ne owacho ni onego okaw mapek ripode ma wacho ni kidieny mar ang'wen mar masira mar Korona nyalo biro e dwe mar Julai, mi gikwayo Migawo mar Thieth mondo omed kinda mondo gipim ji mang'eny kendo ji mang'eny oyud chanjo mondo masira mar Korona kik hiny ji mang'eny ahinya.
The principals also regretted the devastating effects of floods across the country that has led to the loss of lives and destruction of property, calling upon the relevant authorities to put in place urgent measures to curb this situation.	Jotelogo ne oywago kaka ataro osekelo chandruoge madongo Kenya duto kendo omiyo ji owito ngimagi kod mwandu mang'eny. Ne gikwayo jo sirkal ma omi migawo mag konyo e wechego mondo otim mapiyo kaka nyalore mondo gires weche.
They also called upon the government to intensify the distribution of subsidised seeds and fertiliser to farmers to take advantages of the ongoing rains.	Bende ne gikwayo sirkal mondo okow ne jopur mapiyo piyo kodhi kod manyiwa ma sirkal chiwo gi nengo mayot, mondo gi ti kodgi sama koth pod chueni.
Lastly, the Principals applauded the Senate for its decision to impeach the Governor of Wajir, terming it a bold step in the fight against corruption and impunity in the Counties.	Gikone, jotelogo ne opwoyo Senet kuom golo Gavana ma Wajir e tich. Ne giwacho ni senet okawo okang' motegno mar tieko mibadhi kod wang' teko e kaunti mag Kenya.
Voting is underway in the Juja and Bonchari parliamentary by-elections.	Ji dhi nyime lwaro ombulu e yiero matin miyieroe Jobunge e konstichuensi mag  Juja kod Bonchari.
This comes as the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission prepares to deliver results for three by-elections perceived to be an acid test for President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga.	Magi timore  sama Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission ikore mondo giland dwoko mag yiero matin adek ma wachore ni gin dwoko mabiro nyiso kama jo Kenya oketoe jotelo adek madongo mag siasa; Ker Uhuru Kenyatta, Jalup ker William Ruto kod Jatend ODM Raila Odinga.
A by-election is also happening in Rurii Ward in Nyandarua County where Jubilee is battling United Democratic Alliance (UDA).	Yiero matin bende dhi nyime e Ward ma Rurii Ward, e Kaunti ma Nyandarua, kama pati mar  Jubilee rakore gi pati mar United Democratic Alliance (UDA).
A spot check in the two constituencies reveals that voters had lined up from as early as 5 am.	Wachore ni e kaunti ariyogo jo go ombulu ne osechako pango lain saa 11 mokinyi.
The electoral agency opened the polling stations some minutes after 7 am.	Riwruok mar yiero ne oyawo kar yierono dakika matin bang' saa 1 mokinyi.
The two by-elections took a popularity contest with either party accusing the others of harassment and intimidation.	E yiero ariyo matindogo, moro kamoro kuom pati ma ne piemgo ne wacho ni gin ema polise ne sandogi. Ne gitimo kamano mondo onere ni gin ema ohergi kod ji mang'eny.
In Bonchari, the battle is pitting President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party, Raila Odinga's ODM and DP William Ruto-linked UDA.	Kata kamano, e yiero mar Bonchari, pati adek rakore; Jubilee ma en pati mar Ker Uhuru Kenyatta, ODM ma en pati mar  Raila Odinga kod pati mar UDA, motudore gi jalup ker William Ruto.
In Juja, Jubilee is facing off with Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria's Ndung'u Koimburi candidate running on the People's Empowerment Party.	Pati mar Jubilee rakore gi Ndung'u Koimburi, ja People's Empowerment Party kendo ng'at Moses Kuria, Jabunge ma Gatundu South.
The Juja parliamentary seat became vacant after MP Francis Waititu succumbed to brain cancer on February 22, 2021, at MP Shah Hospital.	Kom jabunge ma Juja ne odong' nono bang' tho mar Francis Waititu, ma ne en Jabunge ma kuno. Kansa mar obwongo ema ne onego Jabungeno. Ne otho MP Shah Hospital, Februar 22, 2021.
Waititu was elected on a Jubilee ticket during the 2017 General Election. He garnered 66,190 votes.	Waititu ne ochung' molocho gi otiko mar  Jubilee e Yiero Maduong' mar  2017.  Ne oyudo ombulu 66,190.
According to IEBC, Juja constituency has 114,761 registered voters.	Kaluwore gi IEBC, konstichuensi ma Juja nigi jo go ombulu 114,761 mopwodh.
The 2017 General Election had an 80 per cent voter turn-out which saw 91,801 Kenyans casting their votes in the region.  	E Yiero Maduong' ma  2017, pasent 80 mar jo go ombulu mopwodh e alworano ne ogoyo ombulu. Jo Kenya 91,801 ne ogoyo ombulu e alworano.
11 candidates were cleared to contest.	Ne opwodh ji 11 mondo olar kom.
In Bonchari, the seat was left vacant following the death of MP Oroo Oyioka.	Kom ne odong' nono  Bonchari bang' tho mar Jabunge Ooro Oyioka.
The ruling Jubilee Party, ODM, UDA and Maendeleo Chap Chap are among those that have fielded candidates in the by-election occasioned by the death of area MP John Oroo Oyioka.	Moko kuom pati ma oketo joma chung' e yiero matinno, bang' tho Jabunge John Oroo Oyioka gin kaka; Jubilee ma koro nie loch,  ODM, UDA kod Maendeleo Chap Chap .
UDA has party fronted Teresa Bitutu, the widow of the former MP, while Raila’s party has presented Pavel Oimeke and Jubilee one-time area MP Zebedeo John Opore.	UDA oketo Teresa Bitutu ma en chi Jabunge ma yande othono, Pati mar Raila to oketo  Pavel Oimeke, to Jubilee oketo Zebedeo John Opore ma en Jabunge machon.
The Gusii region has been known to see fringe parties triumph in elections as so-called big parties are left high and dry. 	Alwora mar  Gusii ong'ere gi tim mar yiero joma wuok e pati matindo tindo ma ok ong'ere, kendo weyo  jopati madongo dongo ka neno e kor yamo.
Despite winning the Kisii gubernatorial, senatorial and woman rep seats, ODM emerged empty-handed in constituency seats with no parliamentary candidate in the area winning on the Orange ticket in 2017.	Kata obedo ni ODM ne oloyo kom Gavana kod kombe mag  seneta kod mar miyo machung' ne mine. Ne giwuok gi lwetgi nono kodok korka Jobunge. Ne ok giloyo kata mana kom achiel mar Jabunge e yiero mar  2017.
While ODM is seeking to consolidate its support in Kisii which is regarded as its base, Matiang’i is said to be keen on ensuring Jubilee Party wins to weigh his support in the area.	Konchiel, ODM dwaro ni giloch Kisii nimar ikwano Kisii kaka kar ODM.To komachielo, wachore ni  Matiang’i kedo mondo Pati ma Jubilee oloch mondo oriwe lwedo e alworano.
As President Uhuru Kenyatta continues to maintain studious silence on the High Court ruling on the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), his allies have decided to play safe as they plot their political moves.	 Ker Uhuru Kenyatta oling' thi, kendo ok owuo e wi kes ma Doho Mamalo ne ong'ado e wach  Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), osiepene chano okang' ma gibiro kawo mos nikech ok gidwar wach.
Birthed by the handshake between President Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga, the initiative to unite Kenyans that metamorphosised into the plan to amend the 2010 Constitution had co-opted top party leaders including Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Moses Wetangula (Ford Kenya), Charity Ngilu (Narc) and Gideon Moi (Kanu).	Chenro mar BBI ne ochakore gi Mosruok ma ne otimore e kind Ker Kenyatta kod jatend ODM Raila Odinga. Ne gi Mosre mondo giriw jo Kenya  obed e achiel. Parono ema ne onyuolo wach loko Chik ma 2010. Jotelo madongo mag pati mag siasa ne oriwo wachno lwedo. Ne giriwo,  Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Moses Wetangula (Ford Kenya), Charity Ngilu (Narc) kod Gideon Moi (Kanu).
After High Court Judges Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Teresia Matheka and Chacha Mwita declared the BBI unconstitutional, the politicians who seems to have been caught flatfooted have now adopted a cautions response to the matter.	Jong'ad bura ma Doho Mamalo  Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Teresia Matheka kod Chacha Mwita ne owacho ni chenro mar  BBI ok luwre gi chik mar Kenya. Wachno ne ogoyo josiasago nyang'eng' nimar ne ok gipar ni inyalo wit wachgino oko. Koro ging'wony kendo gitero weche mos.
Aware of the BBI timelines and the clock ticking fast towards the next General Election which is 14 months away and fear that the referendum to change the law could slip through their fingers, Raila, Kalonzo, Mudavadi and Wetang'ula seem to be coming to reality that time is not on their side.	Nenore ni Raila, Kalonzo, Mudavadi gi  Wetang'ula fwenyo ni seche dhi ka mayogi wang'gi. Kinde moket mar tieko chenro mar BBI dhi ka rumo, kendo odong' mana dweche 14 chop Yiero Maduong'. Giluor ni dipo ka gilalo thuolo mar timo refarendam mar loko chik.
The ANC leader has already called for a national conference to relook the BBI. But is quick to note that the process should not be limited to happening before the next General Election.	Jatelo mar  ANC osekwayo ni riwruoge mopogore opogore mag Kenya mondo orom mondo ginon kendo wach BBI. Kata kamano, owacho ni ok onego ochun ni mano otimre kapok Yiero Maduong' maluwoni otimore.
"""Regardless of the results from any appeals preferred, the bulk of the provisions of the BBI Bill will not, for sure, become operational in next year’s General Election... for instance the proposed 70 constituencies would not be applicable if a referendum is not concluded before August 2022,"" said Mudavadi."	"Mudavadi ne owacho niya: ""Bed ni giloyo apil kata ooyo, ng'eny gik ma Chik BBI ok bi timore kapok Yiero Maduong' ma higa mabiro ochopo...kuom ranyisi, ok wanyal bedo gi konstichuensi 70 kapo ni ok otiek timo refarandam chop Agost 2022."
Instead, the ANC leader has proposed that the entire process to change the law starts a fresh and be guided by the High Court verdict.	Jatend ANC wacho ni ochak manyien chenro mar loko chik kendo ji oluw kaka Doho Mamalo ong'ado.
He argues that there must be a silver lining out of the court’s judgement and Kenyans should re-start a proper conversation in the format of the 1997 IPPG arrangement.	Owacho ni nyaka bed ni nitie gima ber manyalo wuok e kes ma Doho Mamalo ong'ado, omiyo Jo Kenya owinjore ochak mbaka manyien ka giluwo chenro mar Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group kata IPPG ma 1997.
"""We should not throw out the baby with the bathwater,"" said Mudavadi."	"Mudavadi wacho ni, ""Ok onego owit oko chenro duto mar BBI, nitiere mana lokruoge matin monego otim kuome kae to bedo chenro maber."""
Raila who was the first to respond to the ruling expressed his disappointment in the turn of events and vowed to move to Court of Appeal.	Raila ema ne okwongo wacho kaka osin gi Doho Mamalo ong'ado kesno kendo ne owacho ni odhi tero wachno e Doho mar Apil.
“We will move to the Court of Appeal to present our case as to why we think the High Court did not render the right verdict. We will do so with sobriety and with respect for our judges and courts,” said Raila.	Raila ne owacho niya; “Wabiro tero wachni e Doho mar Apil. Wabiro nyisogi gimomiyo waparo ni Doho Mamalo ne ok ong'ado kesni kaka owinjore. Wabiro timo kamano gi paro maliw kendo wabiro miyo jong'ad bura luor kaachiel gi kot mag pinywa.”
He however, said the judgement was a direct disrespect for the Presidency and the Office of the President.	Kata kamano, ne owacho ni bura ma ne ging'adono ne onyiso ni gichayo Ker, kendo gichayo migawo mar Ker.
The ODM leader urged those opposed to the ruling to restrain from personalised attacks on the court and the judges.	Jatend ODM ne owacho ne jogo ma ok mor gi bura mong'adno mondo gidikre kendo kik gidonjre gi jong'ad bura achiel kachiel, bende kik gidonjre gi doho.
"""We must respect its ruling and its freedom to exercise its judgment as it understands the legal and constitutional matters before it,"" said Raila."	"Raila ne owacho niya: ""Nyaka wami luor kes ma ging'adono kendo wang'e ni gin gi ratiro mar ng'ado bura kaluwore gi kaka giwinjo chik.”"
President Kenyatta is working on the appeal through the Attorney General Paul Kihara and Solicitor General Ken Ogeto.	Ker Kenyatta tiyo gi Paul Kihara ma en  Atoni Jener kod Ken Ogeto ma en Solicitor General, kata jal ma nono kes duto motudore gi sirkal.
The AG has already filed notice of appeal at the Court of Appeal and moved to the High Court’s Constitutional Court and Human Rights division to seek stay order. 	Atoni Jener osetero notis mar apil e Doho mar Apil, kendo osekwayo kidienje moko mag Doho Mamalo, kaka Doho Mar Chik mar Kenya kod kidieny mar Ratiro mag Dhano mondo gichung kesno.
Meanwhile, lawyer Ahmednassir Abdullahi believes that Raila should not appeal the BBI judgment.	Ahmednassir Abdullahi neno ni Raila ok onego oter wach BBI e Doho mar Apil.
Perhaps keen to take in such advice, Raila has been on vacation in Watamu, Kilifi County and is yet to assemble a team of lawyers to prepare an appeal.  	Nyalo bedo ni Raila owinjo paro mochiwno. Oyueyo Watamu, Kaunti ma Kilifi, podi ok oyiero grup mar okinde mabiro loso apilno.
Yesterday, Kalonzo broke his silence on the High Court judgement and called on Kenyans to respect the rule of law despite disagreeing with the decision.	Nyoro eka Kalonzo ne ohango wuoyo e wi bura ma Doho Mamalo ne ong'ado. Ne owacho ni Jo Kenya onego omi chik luor kata obed ni ok giyie gi bura ma ong'adno.
The Wiper leader insisted that although a number of Kenyans were not happy about the ruling, they need to respect the Judiciary.	Jatend Wiper ne owacho ni kata obedo ni Jo Kenya mang'eny ok omor gi kes mong'adno, nyaka gimi luor kidieny mar sirkal ma ochung'ne weche mag chik, kata Judiciary.
High voltage	Wach Maliet Ka Pas
"""I also ask all Kenyans to respect due process, and respect our Judiciary. It is neither wise nor helpful to disparage the Judiciary on account of the High Court Judgment. Even though some of us may disagree with various declarations made in that high voltage judgment, we can disagree without being disagreeable,"" said Kalonzo."	"Kalonzo ne owacho niya: ""Bende akwayo Jo Kenya duto ni giluor chenro moseket, kendo gimi Judiciary luor. Ok en tim rieko kendo onge gima wakonyo sama wakidhore gi Judiciary nikech bura ma Doho Mamalo ong'ado. Kata ka jomoko kuomwa ok oyie gi weche moko mowach e kes maliet kapasno, podi wanyalo dimbore."
Kenya’s constitution-making process, the Wiper leader noted, was never been easy from the first efforts recorded by the Lancaster House Conference.	Jatend Wiper ne owacho ni nyaka ne kwong los chik mar Kenya e romo mar  Lancaster House Conference, wach loko chik ok osegabedo mayot.
Wetang'ula warned Kenyans against name calling of the five judges.	Wetang'ula siemo Jo Kenya ni giwe yanyo jong'ad bura abichgo.
"""My advice to those in leadership is to remember in our court hierarchy we have layers of courts, those who are not happy, the Court of Appeal doors are open,"" he said."	"Ne owacho niya, ""Jotel ma ok mor gi bura mong'adno onego ong'e ni nitiere kidienje mopogore opogore mag doho. Gin thuolo tero kesno e Doho mar Apil.”"
The Ford-Kenya leader urged the political divide not to engage in name calling against the judges.  	Jatend Ford-Kenya ne owacho ne josiasa ni giwe yanyo jong'ad burago.
Mohamud impeachment: Be lenient with me, Wajir Governor pleads with senators	Golo Mohamud e kom: Gavana ma Wajir kwayo jo senet mondo onyise ng'wono.
Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud pleaded with the Senate to spare him after the special committee upheld his impeachment by the County Assembly of Wajir over gross violation of the constitution. 	Gavana ma Wajir Mohamed Abdi Mohamud ne okwayo Jo Senet mondo ging'wonne bang' komiti makende mar senet wacho ni onego ogole e kom mana kaka Od Bura ma Wajir ne okwayo. Ne giwacho ni otim kamano nikech ne oyud ni gavanano ne oketho chik e okang' malach.
While addressing the Senate on May 17 before the senators took a vote on his ouster, Governor Mohamud urged the Senators to be humane and give him a chance to serve the people of Wajir.	Kane owuoyo e nyim Senet, Mei tarik 17 kapok Jo Senet ogoyo ombulu mar gole e migawone, Gavana Mohamud ne okwayo Jo Senet mondo ginyise ng'wono kendo gimiye thuolo mar tiyone Jo Wajir.
Mohamud said he might have violated the constitution, but the violation cannot be gross based on what his administration has achieved within the four years.	Mohamud ne owacho ni nyalo bedo ni oketho chik, kata kamano, ok dibed ni oketho chik e okang' maduong' ahinya king'iyo gik mosetimo kuom higni ang'wen mosebedogo e kom.
“I wish to plead with the Senate to be sympathetic and not use one aspect to oust me, let the Senate be humane and give us a chance so that we can serve our people,” he said.	Ne owacho niya; “Daher kwayo Jo Senet mondo gibed gi chuny mang'won kendo kik gigola e kom ka ging'iyo mana weche nyakonchiel. Akwayou ni mondo umiya thuolo mondo ati ne jowa.”
In the health sector, where he is accused of failing to provide services leading to loss of lives, Governor Mohamud said his administration has built 50 health facilities and bought more ambulances for the county in the last four years.	Kodok korka weche e kidieny mar thieth, wachore ni  Mohamud ok osechiwo gik madwarore kendo mano osemiyo ji mang'eny olalo ngimagi.

“We have built over 50 health facilities in Wajir within the four years at least every ward has one dispensary or more. We also managed to buy more ambulances with 16 currently operational,” he said.

Bende, ne wang'iewo ambyulens momedore, gie sani 16 tiyo.”
He said his officers in the health department gave adequate information on health status in Wajir and wondered why they were only picking on issues such as generator breakdowns to impeach him.	Ne owacho ni ofisa manie migawo mar thieth ma Wajir osegolo ripot moting'o weche moromo e wi chal mar weche thieth kuno, kendo giwuoro gimomiyo ing'iyo mana weche kaka jenereta masiko kethore mondo odonjnego.
He said Wajir has had challenges of power in most of his facilities because of the use of generators instead of electricity.	Owacho ni Wajir osebedo gi chandruok mag stima  kuonde mang'eny nikech gitiyo kod jenereta.
“We are not on the national grid, we depend on generator driven by fuel, hence rampant breakdowns challenges,” he pleaded.	Ne oywak ni “Chenro mar sirkal mar ywayo stima kata national grid, podi ok ochopo Wajir. Omiyo watiyo gi genereta maringo gi mo, kendo mano ema omiyo gisiko gikethore.”
Governor Mohamud pleaded for leniency saying out of the 17 charges, only one was substantiated against him, adding that it meant they were frivolous.	Gavana Mohamud ne oywak ni ging'wonne nimar kuom weche 17 ma ne odonjnego, en mana wach achiel ma osir, kendo mano nyiso ni weche mamoko ma odonjnego gin weche matindo tindo.
The Senate committee had recommended Governor Mohamud over gross violation of the constitution.	Komiti mar Senet ne owacho ni ogol Gavana Mohamud e tich nikech oketho chik e okang' malach.
The Nyamira Senator Okon’go Omogeni-chaired committee found that the Wajir county boss was guilty of gross violation of the Constitution by flouting the County Government Act, Public Procurement Act and Asset Disposal Act and the Public Finance Management Act.

The committee, however, absolved the governor of abuse of office and gross misconduct charges, saying the Members of County Assembly did not provide sufficient evidence.

The final vote on his proposed impeachment by the Senate will take place this evening.	Kawuon godhiambo ema ibiro go ombulu mogik mabiro nyiso ka be ibiro gole e migawone kata ooyo.
Mohamud was impeached on Tuesday, April 27, after 37 MCAs voted in favour of his ouster, while 10 opposed his removal.	Ne ogol Mohamud e kom Tich Ariyo, April tarik  27, bang' Jo Od Bura 37 goyo ombulu mar gole to 10 goyo ombulu matamre wachno.
Senate suspends ouster debate for 15 minutes after Governor Mohamud falls ill	Jo Senet chungo romo kuom dakika 15 bang' Gavana Mohamud bedo matuwo.
The Senate was forced to adjourn for 15 minutes during the impeachment hearing of Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud after he fell ill a few minutes before the debate started.	Ne ochuno Jo Senet chungo chokruok kuom dakika  15  kinde ma ne igoloe Gavana ma Wajir Mohamed Abdi Mohamud e kom, nikech gavanano ne obedo matuwo dakika matin kapok ochak yal kesne.

While making the request before the Senate on May 17, lead lawyer Ndegwa Njiru told the Senate that Governor Mohamud fell ill a few minutes before the debate started but was able to recover	Mei, tarik 17  kane Ndegwa Njiru ma ne otelo ne okindego kwayo Jo Senet mondo omigi thuolo matin, ne owacho ni Gavana Mohamud obedo matuwo dakika matin kapok ochak kesne to koro odhi maber.

Ne owacho niya: “Ne awuoyo kode dakika matin kapok ochak yal kesne. Ne oyudo obedo matuwo matin kata kamano odhi maber sani kendo en e yo obiro, omiyo akwayo ni umiye dakika 10 kata 15.”
Njiru while pleading with the Senate said it was the governor who was on trial and deserves to be heard	Sama Njiru ne kwayo Jo Senet mondo omigi thuolo matin ne owacho ni gavanano ema ne nigi kes kendo en ema owinjore owuo.
He said Governor Mohamud will be given at least five minutes to defend himself before his legal team can wrap up the defence.	Ne owacho ni ibiro mi Gavana Mohamud gimoro dakika abich mondo owuo kapok okil makore owacho wechegi mogik.
“Once he arrives, he will be allocated five minutes to defend himself before the lawyers can summarise on the same,” he said.	Ne owacho ni, “Kochopo achopa ni i, ibiro miye dakika abich mondo owach makore kae to okindene biro tieko gi weche momedore.”
While contributing to the request, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen said it was normal for someone to fall ill more so when faced with things like an impeachment.	Kipchumba Murkomen, Seneta ma Elgeyo Marakwet ma ne riwo lwedo kwayono ne owacho ni ng'ato ang'ata nyalo bedo matuwo  to moloyo sama ochomore gi wach kaka mae.
“It is not surprising to find anyone to fall ill in these difficult moments, we should find the right Standing Order to find how we can adjourn,” said Murkomen.	Murkomen ne owacho niya, “Ok kaw ng'ato giwuoro ni ng'ato nyalo bedo matuwo e kinde matekgi, wamanyuru Chik Od Bura manyalo yienwa mondo wachung chokruogni.”
A senate committee had earlier recommended the removal of Wajir Governor Mohamud over gross violation of the constitution.	Ne oyudo komiti mar senet oseng'ado ni ogol Gavana ma Wajir Mohamud e tich nikech oketho chik e okang' malach.
The Nyamira Senator Okon’go Omogeni-chaired committee found that the Wajir county boss was guilty of a gross violation of the Constitution by flouting the County Government Act, Public Procurement Act and Asset Disposal Act and the Public Finance Management Act.

The committee, however, absolved the governor from abuse of office and gross misconduct charges, saying the Members of County Assembly did not provide sufficient evidence.	Kata kamano, komitino ne owito oko weche ma ne odonjnego gavanano ni otiyo marach gi migawone kendo ni otimo timbe madongo ma ok owinjore gi jatich sirkal. Ne giwacho ni Jo Od Bura ma Kauntino ne ok osiro wechego malong'o.
The MCAs cited financial impropriety, abuse of office, gross misconduct and violation of the Constitution as grounds for his removal.

MCAs from eight county assemblies in Central have raised concern over the gains the region stands to lose should the appeal on the BBI ruling fail at the Court of Appeal. 	Jo Od Bura mag kaunti aboro mag Central wuoyo e wi ber ma Jo Central ok bi yudo kapo ni Doho mar Apil ok oloko bura moseng'ad ne chenro mar BBI .
Speaking in Nyeri on Monday, chairpersons of the assembly Justice and Legal Affairs Committees (JLAC) said the region was expected to have the proposed 17 new constituencies.

The MCAs drawn from Nyeri, Nakuru, Tharaka Nithi, Muranga, Meru, Laikipia, Kiambu and Embu county assemblies expressed support for constitutional amendments saying this will increase the region's political representation at the county and national level	Jo Od Burago ne owuok e kaunti mag Nyeri, Nakuru, Tharaka Nithi, Muranga, Meru, Laikipia, Kiambu kod Embu.

Further, Ms Wanjiku noted that the assemblies conducted more than 150 public participation forums where the BBI report received support of the people.	Ms Wanjiku ne owacho ni ute bura ne otimo chokruoge mokalo 150 gi raia kendo raia ne oriwo chenro mar BBI lwedo.
Mt Kenya JLAC caucus chair Stanley Karanja (MCA Naivasha East) said the proposed Ward Development Fund would have ensured development of the region. 	Stanley Karanja (MCA Naivasha East) ma en jakom mar  Mt Kenya JLAC  ne owacho ni chenro mar BBI mar bedo gi Ward Development Fund kata Pesa mar Ward mag Timo Dongruok, ne dhi miyo gibed gi dongruok e alworano.
"""Currently governors decide which wards to develop and some wards are marginalised due to this situation.

"Ne owacho niya, ""Gie sani jogavana ema ng'ado ni gin ward mage mitimoe dongruok, nikech mano, nitie ward ma ok timie dongruok. Chenro mar BBI ne dwaro walo tenge pes ward, kendo gi mi moro ka moro kuom wardgo milion 20 mar timo dongruok."""
Karanja stated that central Kenya stands to lose close to Sh55 billion through increased allocation to counties from 15 per cent to 35 per cent. 	Karanja ne owacho ni alwora mar central Kenya ok bi yudo gimoro bilion 55, nimar idwaro med pesa mimiyo kaunti gi kind pasent 15 kod pasent 35.

The final vote on his proposed impeachment by the Senate takes place on Monday evening. 	Senet dhi ng'ado wachno mogik Wuok Tich godhiambo.
They accused the county boss of breaching Articles 235 of the Constitution, the County Government Act, and the Public Service Act by allegedly constantly reshuffling county officers.	Ne giwacho ni gavanano ne oketho namba 235 mar Chik mar Kenya, Chik mar Sirkal ma Kaunti kod Chik Matayo  Jotij Sirkal kuom siko ka oloko kuonde ma ofisa mag  kaunti tiyoe.

MCAs have faulted the High Court ruling that declared the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) null and void.	Jo Od Bura wacho ni Doho Mamalo otimo marach kuom ng'ado ni chenro mar  Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) ok nyal tiyo nikech ok oluwre gi chik.
Speaking at a Nairobi hotel yesterday, caucus of MCAs leadership forum chair Meru MCA Victor Kareithi expressed disappointment in the Judges' decision.	Victor Kareithi ma en Ja Od Bura mar Meru kendo jakom mar  Jo Od Bura ne owacho ni ok omor gi bura ma ne ong'adno.
Mr Kareithi argued that the court's decision amounts to taking away the sovereign power of Kenyans in amending the Constitution.	Mr Kareithi ne owacho ni bura ma Dohono ong'ado chalo mana ka gima gimayo Jo Kenya ratiro margi mar timo lokruok e chik.
The MCAs insisted the BBI report was not a product of the Handshake but rather about the people.	Jong'ad Bura ne owacho ni chenro mar BBI ok okel gi Mosruok, en chenro ma raia ema dwaro.
“The judgment does not acknowledge that a Constitution is a living document that must be responsive to the needs and desires of a society at any given time,” they said.	Ne giwacho ni, “Bura ma ging'adono nyiso ni ok ging'eyo ni Chik mar Kenya en gima inyalo lok sa asaya mondo ochop dwaro kod gombo mag raia.”
The MCAs faulted the declaration that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) was not properly constituted and cannot conduct a referendum because it has no quorum after some commissioners resigned.	Jo Od Burago ne owacho ni ne ok owinjore owach ni  Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) onge kwan mar komisona ma chik dwaro kendo ok ginyal timo refarendam. Nimar moko kuom jokomisona ne oweyo tich.
The judges ruled that all the actions taken by IEBC concerning the BBI Bill are null and void.	Jong'ad bura ne orucho  gik moko duto ma ne IEBC otimo. Giwacho ni IEBC ne ok oluwo chik.
“We find it strange that the bench found that on one hand IEBC can transact business but on the other hand it cannot because of a statute that provides a quorum of five members. Clearly, the bench elevated a statute over the Constitution,” he said.	Ne owacho niya; “Gima kawowa giwuoro en ni jong'ad bura oyie ni IEBC nyalo tiyo to komachielo ok onyal tiyo nikech chik moro mar riwruokgi wacho ni komisona nyaka bed abich mondo eka giti. Nenore maler ni jong'ad bura omiyo chik mar riwruok pek maduong' moloyo Chik mar Kenya.
The MCAs faulted the declaration that the BBI process was not all-inclusive.	Jo Od Burago ne owacho ni jong'ad bura ne otimo marach ng'ado ni chenro mar BBI ne ok oriwo ji duto.
On Thursday, the judges ruled that a constitutional amendment through a popular initiative is only a preserve of the ordinary Kenyans and not the executive.	Chieng' Tich Ang'wen, jong'ad bura ne owacho ni timo lokruok e Chik mar Kenya nikech joma ng'eny dwaro lokruokno, en gima raia ema timo to ok joma nie loch.
They declared that the BBI Taskforce was an unlawful entity.	Ne giwacho ni joma ne omi migawo mar loso chenro mar BBI ne ok opwodh gi chik.
“A Declaration is hereby made that being an unconstitutional and unlawful entity, the Steering Committee on the Implementation of the Building Bridges to a United Kenya Taskforce Report, has no legal capacity to initiate any action towards promoting constitutional changes,” the judges ruled.	Jong'ad burago ne ong'ado niya, “Bura ma wang'ado en ni, nikech BBI ok opwodh gi chik, Komiti mar Chano Kaka BBI biro tiyo kata Steering Committee on the Implementation of the Building Bridges kaachiel gi Ripot mar Joma omi Migawo mar Loso Chenrono kata United Kenya Taskforce Report, onge ratiro mar timo gimoro amora manyalo miyo otim lokruok e Chik mar Kenya.
Kareithi said all concerned parties had popularised the Bill and it received approval of county assemblies and Parliament.	Kareithi ne owacho ni jotelo duto ma ne wachno mulo ne osewuoyo gi raia e wi lokruogego, mi giyie, kendo jo od bura mag kaunti kod Od Piny Owacho ne oyie ni otim lokruogego.
“The secretariat popularised the Bill which was endorsed by over three million voters against the constitutional requirement. It was then approved by parliament. It’s imperative to note that before these approvals, these legislative bodies held over 100 national and county-based intensive public participation forums,” he said.	Ne owacho niya, “Joma ochung' ne sirkal ne onyiso raia ber mar lokruogego, kendo raia ne orwako wach loko chik mi raia milion adek ne oketo seyi margi kaka chik dwaro, mi Od Piny Owacho oyie gi lokruogego.

Ne omi raia thuolo mang'eny mar chiwo pachgi e chokruogego.”
As BBI proponents head to Court of Appeal today the MCA’s said in the event the High Court decision is upheld, Kenyans stand to lose if allocation to counties remains at 15 per cent of the national revenue instead of the 35 per cent proposed in the Bill.	Sama joma riwo lwedo chenro mar BBI dhi e Doho mar Apil kawuono, Jo Od Bura wacho ni kapo ni Dohono ok oketho bura ma Doho Mamalo ne ong'ado, Jo Kenya biro dhi asara nikech ibiro dhi nyime miyo kaunti pasent 15 mar yuto mar sirkal, to chenro mar BBI ne dwaro ni omigi pasent 35.
“The legislative gridlock inflow of Division of Revenue Bill and enactment of county Allocation of Revenue Acts will remain and therefore paralysis in running the county governments will remain a recurrent matter,” he said.	Ne owacho niya, “Pek mabedoga e luwo chik mar Pogo Yuto mar Piny ne Kidienje Duto mag Sirkal  kata Division of Revenue Bill biro siko. Ibiro pog kaunti pesa kiluwo chik mar Allocation of Revenue Acts. Omiyo sirkal mag kaunti biro siko ka moko ma ok ginyal tiyo nikech nok mar pesa.
They further stated that 1,450 wards in Kenya will miss out on the proposed Ward Development Fund.	Ne gimedo ni ward  1,450 mag Kenya ok bi yudo pes Dongruok mar Ward kata Ward Development Fund kapo ni oketh chenro mar BBI.

Rift Valley politics is bracing for a shakeup as legislators allied to Deputy President William Ruto’s Jubilee Party prepare to jump ship to the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Party ahead of next year’s General Election.	Siasa mag Rift Valley dhi bedo gilokruoge madongo nikech jobunge man kor jalup ker William Ruto manie pati mar Jubilee iikore mar wuok e patino kendo donjo e pati mar  United Democratic Alliance (UDA) ka pok Yiero Maduong' ma higa mabiro ochopo.
The Standard on Sunday has established that governors, senators, MPs and MCAs are angling for positions in the new party, which they intend to use to either seek re-election or frustrate their rivals.	The Standard on Sunday ne owacho ni jogavana, joseneta, jobunge gi jo Od Bura mag kaunti manyo kaka digiyud kombe e pati manyienno, gidwaro ni oyiergi kendo kod otiko mar patino kata gilo joma gibiro piemgo ka gitiyo gi otiko mar patino.
The political realignment has been triggered by a falling out between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto, who rode the crest of a wave of popularity in the Rift Valley to emerge victorious in the 2013 and 2017 elections.	Lokruoge mag siasagi timore nikech weche ok dhi maber ahinya e kind Ker  Uhuru Kenyatta kod Ruto. Jo Rift Valley ne ohero ji ariyogo ahinya mi ne giloyo yiero mag 2013 kod 2017.
With Ruto on record saying he may consider exiting Jubilee for UDA, whose national chairman is Johnstone Muthama, there has been manoeuvering behind the scenes to secure control of the party that has not gone down well with some of the DP’s supporters.	Ruto ne owacho ni onyalo wuok e pati mar Jubilee mi odhi e pati mar UDA. Jakom mar patino en Johnstone Muthama. Nenore ni jopatino laro telo mar patigino e kindgi, kendo wachore ni moko kuom joma riwo jalup ker lwedo ok mor gi kaka weche dhi.
“We are aware of agents of disunity moving around hoodwinking people that they have the blessings of the deputy president to control affairs of UDA in counties. They have positioned people to take up positions as interim officials,” Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri told The Sunday Standard recently.	Nyocha, Kimani Ngunjiri ma en jabura ma Bahati ne owacho ne The Sunday Standard niya; “Wang'eyo ni nitie joma dwaro pogowa, giwuotho koni gi koni ka ginyiso ji ni jalup ker oyienegi mondo gichik gik matimore e pati mag UDA e kaunti. Giseketo ji mondo omak migepe sama ji rito yiero.”
The MP, who is one of Ruto’s firm supporters, has been hosting delegations of elders, youth leaders and women at his Bahati home to popularise UDA and the ‘wheelbarrow’ agenda, which is aligned to Ruto’s ‘Hustler Nation’ movement.	Jabungeno, ma jakor Ruto motegno, osebedo kaluongo grube mag jodongo, jotelo mag youth kod mine e dalane ma Bahati. Owuoyo kodgi e wi ber mag UDA kod chenro mar ‘wheelbarrow’  ma en chenro motudre gi ‘Hustler Nation’ mar Ruto.
As UDA embarks on a drive to register new members in the next two months to pave the way for elections, Mr Ngunjiri warned that political brokers are planning to hijack the party’s leadership at the grassroots. 	 UDA dhi nyime gi chenrone mar manyo joma donjo e patigi e dweche ariyo maluwogi mondo giikre ne yiero.

He urged Mr Muthama to ensure all party activities are done transparently as the recruitment process continues.	Ne owacho ne  Migosi Muthama ni one ni weche mag pati itimo e ler sama pod imanyo ji mondo odonj e pati.
Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei said elected leaders from the region “are in agreement” that UDA is their party of choice in the next General Election. The UDA secretariat, he added, has already trained coordinators through a website that will be used to register members.	Samson Cherargei ma en Seneta ma Nandi ne owacho ni jotelo mag alworano osewinjore ni UDA e pati ma gibiro larogo kombe e Yiero Maduong' mabiro.

“We are excited over the ongoing exercise. Coordinators will do the outreach and members recruited virtually because of the prevailing Covid-19 situation. We target to register over 300,000 members in Nandi County alone,” said Mr Cherargei.	Cherargei ne owacho niya; “Wamor gi kaka weche dhi.

Aldai MP Cornelly Serem said the region is undergoing political change ahead of the elections.	Cornelly Serem, jabunge ma  Aldai ne owacho ni weche siasa lokore e alworano kaka ji ochomo yiero manyien.
“We are planning for our next home after the Jubilee debacle. Currently, we are registering members and then hold grassroots elections.

Uasin Gishu UDA coordinator Paul Kiprop allayed fears that some officials are receiving preferential treatment in the new outfit. 	Paul Kiprop jal mochung'ne weche UDA  Uasin Gishu ne onyiso ji ni kik giluor ni ok tim ne ji duto marom e pati manyienno.
He said those managing the party were doing so on a voluntary basis to mobilise support and strengthen it ahead of the elections.	Owacho ni joma ochung' ne weche patino gie sani, ochiwore achiwa kendo gitimo kamano mondo giyud joma riwogi lwedo mondo pati obed motegno kapok yiero ochopo.
“In Uasin Gisu County, Soy MP Caleb Kositany and his Kapseret counterpart Oscar Sudi are championing party issues. There are still challenges of resources and we call on UDA supporters to assist in fostering it,” Mr Kiprop said.	Mr Kiprop ne owacho niya: “E kaunti ma Uasin Gisu, Jabunge ma Soy, Caleb Kositany kod nyawadgi  Oscar Sudi, Jabunge ma Kapseret tiyo matek ne pati mar UDA.

“The problem that leads to a transition in parties is mistrust and inconsistency in party leadership. We would not be having UDA membership registration at the moment if Jubilee was consistent and stuck to its manifesto,” said Kiprop.	Kiprop ne owacho niya: “Gima miyo ji loko pati en ni ji ok genre kendo joma telo ne pati ok chung' e wach achiel.

Mr Sudi, one of the DP’s fiercest defenders, predicted that the Rift Valley will be ‘placed under lock and key’ by Ruto’s camp ahead of the 2022 polls.	Mr Sudi, ma en achiel kuom joma riwo jalup ker lwedo ahinya, ne owacho chon ni chop Yiero Maduong' mar 2022 , Rift Valley duto biro bedo kor Ruto.
“Everyone wants to identify with UDA since it is a party with a good future. Its popularity is growing by the day. In the next five months, we will have hit even greater heights.”	“Ji te ohero chenro mag UDA nikech en pati mabiro dhi maber. Joma here medore pile ka pile.

In Narok County, Emurua Dikir MP Johana Ngeno said that although he was elected on a Kanu ticket, he would be the first to jump ship and join UDA. 	E Kaunti ma Narok, Johana Ngeno, ma en jabunge ma Emurua Dikir, ne owacho ni kata obedo ni ne oyiere gi otiko mar Kanu, ka kinde ochopo obiro riwore gi UDA ma ok oparo diriyo.

Besides the ongoing mass registration of members, Ruto allies have been wooing some of the deputy president’s critics in the Rift Valley to return to the fold.	Mopogore gi kinda mitimo mondo girwak ji mang'eny e pati mar UDA , osiepe Ruto temo hombo moko kuom joma kwedo Ruto e alwora mar Rift Valley mondo gidwog giriwre kode.
Former Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto has been reeled in and has been instrumental in spearheading the ‘wheelbarrow’ agenda in the South Rift region.	Achiel kuom joma oseywa modwogo en Isaac Ruto, Gavana machon ma Bomet. Osekonyo ahinya e lando wach chenro ‘wheelbarrow’ e alwora mar  South Rift.
Close allies of the deputy president told The Sunday Standard that plans are underway to welcome back former powerful Internal Security Permanent Secretary Zakayo Cheruiyot and West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo.

Gitile Naituli, a professor of management and leadership at Multimedia University, said there are signs party chairman Gideon Moi will enter into an alliance with like-minded leaders thus thrusting him at the centre of the Uhuru succession matrix.

BBI judgment: Uhuru's worst nightmare since Maraga's 2017 shocker	Bura Mong'adne BBI: Wach marachie mogik motimore ne Uhuru nyaka ne Maraga wit oko yiero mar Ker ma  2017
President Uhuru Kenyatta has been exposed politically by Thursday’s High Court ruling, which could trigger a litany of suits and a possible bid for impeachment.	Bura ma Doho Mamalo ne ong'ado Tich Ang'wen oketo ker kama ok ber. Burano nyalo miyo odonj ne Ker Uhuru Kenyatta e doho gi ketho mang'eny mag siasa.
The five-judge Bench accused the president of violating chapter six of the Constitution, after consolidating cases from several litigants challenging the constitutional review process through the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).	 Bang' manyo weche kuom okinde mang'eny ma ne kwedo kaka iloko chik kitiyo gi chenro mar Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), jong'ad bura abich ma ne nono kesno ne owacho ni ker ne oketho chik namba auchiel e Chik mar Kenya.
Yesterday, ICPK director Ndungu Wainaina said the BBI process could not be salvaged after the ruling, adding that the judges had made it clear that the basic structure doctrine limits the amendment power.	Nyoro, Ndungu Wainaina ma en jatelo mar  ICPK ne owacho  ni bura ma oseng'adne chenro mar BBI miyo ok nyal rese. Ne omedo ni jong'ad burago ne osenyiso maler ni nitie chike mag piny ma legislature kata  Od Piny Owacho, ok nyal golo.
“The basic structure can only be amended by the primary constituent process,” said Wainaina.	Wanaina ne owacho ni, “Inyalo mana lok chikego ka olok misegi, to mano ok nyalre.”
During the ruling, the judges also said civil court proceedings can be instituted against the president.	Sama ne ing'ado kesno, jong'ad burago ne owacho ni ka ker oketho chik, inyalo donjne e kot.
Legal experts yesterday said President Kenyatta’s remaining tenure could be in limbo, legally.	Joma olony gi weche chik wacho ok ong'ere maler kaka weche mag Ker Uhuru Kenyatta biro dhi e kinde modong'go e loch kapo ni oluw chik.
They said unless the judgment is overturned on appeal, the finding by the five judges was a clarification of the law that the president should observe the limits set by the Constitution and the law.	Ne giwacho ni kapo ni Doho mar Apil ok orucho bura ma Doho Mamalo ne Ong'ado, nonro mag jong'ad bura abichgo nyiso maler ni ker onego oluw Chik mar Kenya ma ok okalo tong'.
However, lawyer Kibe Mungai said although the verdict can be the reason for impeachment, it will be a herculean task because the president enjoys majority support in both houses of Parliament.	Kata kamano, Kibe Mungai ma en okil ne owacho ni, kata obedo ni bura ma ne ong'adno nyalo miyo odonj ne ker e doho, mano nyalo bedo gima tek ahinya nikech ji mang'eny oriwe lwedo e Od Piny Owacho, kata mana joma ok nie sirkande.
“It is not very new, it is a clarification that the president can be sued in his personal capacity and not about his functions, for example, if a president is to rob a bank, he will be sued as an individual and not as a president. That is the correct interpretation in most countries. That is proper finding,” said Mungai.	 Mungai ne owacho niya; “Gima iwachono ok en gima nyien ruok, en mana ni oket weche e yo ma achiel kachiel ni inyaloga donj ne ker, ok wuo e wi migepene. Kuom ranyisi ka ker moro okwalo pesa aching' e bengi moro, ibiro donjne ok kaka ker, to kaka raia mokwelo. Mano e kaka pinje mang'eny tiyo gi chikno.”
The five judges were of the view that the President is only protected from such actions in respect of anything done or not done in the exercise of their powers under this Constitution. 	Jobura abichgo ne wacho ni ginyalo mana geng'o ker mondo kik donjne e yore ma kamago ka bura ma ging'ado kata ma ok ging'ado luwore gi Chik mar Kenya.
“Assuming, in his tenure, the President embarks on a mission that is not only clearly in violation of the Constitution but is also destructive to the nation, would it not be prudent that he should be stopped in his tracks rather than wait until the lapse of his tenure by which time the country may have tipped over the cliff?” they posed.	Ne gipenjo niya: “Wawach ni e kinde ma Ker nie loch ochako gima ketho Chik Kenya achiel kachiel, to ok mano kende, gima otimono keto ngima jo Kenya kama rach, be dibed tim rieko weye mondo osik e loch, nyaka kindene mag loch rum? Donge owinjore ogeng'e mapiyo piyo kapok okelo masira?
The judges were determining President Kenyatta’s role in the BBI process.	Jong'ad bura ne temo nono kaka Ker Kenyatta ne otudore gi chenro mar BBI.
However, the court is split on if he was justified or had powers to appoint the BBI task force. 	Kata kamano, jong'ad bura moko e dohono neno ni ne ok owinjore oket komiti mondo olos chenro mar BBI kendo oonge ratiro mar timo kamano, to jong'ad bura moko neno mopogore.
On one hand, Justice John Mativo said the president was right, while the other judges found that he had breached Chapter Six of the Constitution.	Konchiel, Jang'ad Bura John Mativo wacho ni ker ne ni kare, to komachielo, jong'ad bura mamoko wacho ni ne oketho chik mar auchiel e Chik mar Kenya.
“The President cannot be said to have acted ultra vires the Constitution. He acted intra vires in taking steps to achieve this noble constitutional requirement. The President’s decision meets both the proportionality and rationality tests which are core requirements for the decision to pass the principle of legality test,” Justice Mativo ruled on the formation of the BBI task force.	E wi wach keto komiti maloso chenro mar BBI, Jang'ad Bura Mativo ne ong'ado niya: “Ok wanyal wacho ni Ker ne okalo Chik. Ne otimo mana gik ma chik oyiene timo kuom kawo okenge mondo ochop migawo ma chik omiye. Mondo gimoro obed maluwore gi chik, ok onego okal tong' , bende onego obed gima winjore gi paro malong'o. Okang' ma Ker ne okawono chopo weche ariyogo, omiyo ne ok oketho chik.”
Yesterday, a senior counsel who sought anonymity, said President Kenyatta did not act out of the blues in forming the BBI task force. 	Jang'ad bura moro ma ok dwar ni ohul nyinge nyoro owacho ni Ker Kenyatta ne ok omuoch amuocha kende moketo komiti machano kaka BBI biro tiyo.
He also argues that by the Judiciary participating in the process, it had given its thumb of approval.	Ne owacho bende ni nikech Judiciary ne oriwo chenrono lwedo, mano nyiso ni Judiciary ne opwodho wachno.
“The Judiciary participated in the BBI process. They for example, sought for extension of the time of hearing of the presidential petition. How can the Judiciary participate in the process and then turn around and say the president should be impeached for it?” he posed.	Ne openjo niya,“Judiciary ne oriwo lwedo chenro mar BBI. Kuom ranyisi ne gikwayo mondo omed thuolo mondo owinj kwayo mar ker, ere kaka Judiciary nyalo riwo lwedo chenrono kae to olokre kendo owacho ni onego odonjne ker?
Lawyer Jackson Awele said if there are different interpretations on the President’s role from the High Court, then it is for the Court of Appeal to iron them out.	Okil miluongo ni  Jackson Awele ne owacho ni ka jong'ad bura ma  Doho Mamalo ok nyal winjore kabe Ker ne oketho chik kata ooyo kare en ting' mar Doho mar Apil mondo oler wachno.
“If there are issues which are not in sync, it will be for the Court of Appeal to harmonise them,” Awele said.	Awele ne owacho niya; “Kapo ni nitie weche moko ma tuomore, Doho mar Apil ema biro rieyogi.”
Notably, it is the second time that the High Court has found that President Kenyatta can be sued in person.	Nenore ni ma en kinde mar ariyo ma Doho Mamalo oyudo ni inyalo donj ne Ker Kenyatta achiel kachiel.
In the first case, involving the swearing of 41 judges, High Court judges George Dulu, William Musyoka and James Wakiaga found that the Constitution does not shield the president from being dragged into a constitutional or judicial review court even when in office.	Mokwongo ne en e wach chamo muma mar jong'ad bura 41. Jong'ad Bura mar Doho Mamalo George Dulu, William Musyoka kod James Wakiaga ne owacho ni chik ok geng' ker ni ka pod en e kom ok nyal donjne e doho nikech oketho chik kata okalo tong' moketne.
The three judges, however, pointed out that he should not be sued in person but through the Attorney General.	Kata kamano, jong'ad bura adekgo ne owacho ni ok owinjore odonjne achiel kachiel to odonjne kokalo kuom Atoni Jener.
Yesterday, Law Society of Kenya (LSK) president Nelson Havi said the 321-page judgment is an indictment to President Kenyatta. 	Nyoro, Nelson Havi ma en jatelo mar Law Society of Kenya (LSK) ne owacho ni bura ma ne ong'ad ne Ker Kenyatta e buk moting'o ite 321, ne en kes modonjnego kuom ketho chik.
He said the breach of the Constitution was a serious issue that he can be personally held accountable for. 	Ne owacho ni chik ma ne okethono en ketho maduong' kendo inyalo donjnego.
According to him the judge’s reference to the President as Mr Uhuru also amounted to stripping him of his status as Head of State.	Kaluwore kode, kaka jong'ad bura ne oluongo Ker ni Migosi Uhuru, mano oromo nyiso ni ne gisegolo kuome migape mar bedo Jatelo mar Piny.
There is no decision of the High Court that is as clear on the misconduct of the President as this one.	Kuom weche duto ma Doho Mamalo owacho e wi ketho ma Ker ne otimo, wachni ema keto weche ayanga moloyo.
"""On the judges’ appointment, they just said if he had just breached the Constitution, if it were in Israel or India, he would have resigned. You realised they have referred to him as Mr Kenyatta; they have stripped him the stature of a President. Unfortunately, Parliament is emasculated and will not impeach him but it will go a long way to dent his image as a leader,” Havi said."	Havi ne omedo niya: “ E wi wach keto jong'ad bura, ne giwacho ni dine bed ni Kenya en India kata Israel, to Ker ofwayo kata okalo chik mar piny kaka otimoni, di ne ochune wuok e kom; Donge ne uneno ka giluonge mana ni Migosi Kenyatta; Ne gilonyo migawone kendo koro oonge nyadhi mar Ker.

But early in the week, President Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga had rallied the National Assembly and the Senate to overwhelmingly endorse the BBI Bill, setting the stage for a constitutional review. 	Kata kamano, e chak jumani, Ker Kenyatta kod jatend ODM Raila Odinga ne ochoko Od Bura kod Senet mi ng'enygi ne oriwo lwedo chenro mar BBI, kendo mano ne oiko yo mondo olok chik mar piny.
Only a public endorsement through a referendum was awaiting until the High Court’s shock ruling on Thursday. 	Gima ne odong' ne en mana mondo oganda oket seyi ni giyie kokalo kuom refarandam kapok weche lokore ataro gi bura ma Doho Mamalo ne ong'ado Tich Ang'wen.
The push for law review began with their March 9, 2018 Handshake, following the controversial 2017 presidential elections. 	Wach loko chik ne ochakore Mach tarik 9, 2018 bang' Mosruok ma ne oluwo yiero mar ker ma 2017, ma ne ywaruok ng'enyie.
But the journey to change the 2010 Constitution has not been rosy, after the BBI received a lukewarm reception from Deputy President William Ruto, a voracious civil society that sought to derail the process and then the Covid-19 pandemic, coped with a struggling economy.	Kata kamano, wuoth mar loko Chik ma 2010 ok osebedo mayot. Jalup Ker William Ruto ne chunye ng'ich ng'ich gi wachno, riwruok mar joma kedo ne ratiro oganda ne okedo tho gi kuo mondo chenrono kik dhi nyime, masira mar Korona bende ne omuoch, to e wi mago duto, yore mag yuto ne ok dhi maber.
After the BBI sailed through in Parliament, both Speakers said they were preparing to hand over the Bill to President Kenyatta. 	Bang' Od Bura Owacho pwodho chenro mar BBI, jotelo ariyo mag Od Bura ne owacho ni ne giikore miyo Ker Kenyatta chikno.
“We have finished our role and are waiting for the President to give us an appointment so that we can jointly present the Bill,” said Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka. His National Assembly counterpart Justin Muturi said they had cleared their part. 	 Ken Lusaka ma en Jatelo mar Senet ne owacho niya; “Wasetimo migawowa kendo warito Ker mondo onyiswa chieng' ma wanyalo romo mondo wamiye Chikni ka wan ji ariyo.” Justin Muturi ma en Jatend Od Bura wadgi ne owacho ni gisetieko ma kargi.
“The staff are going through typos and referencing errors before booking an appointment with the president,” said Muturi.	Muturi ne owacho; “Jotich ne loso mana weche matindo e Chikno kaka weche ma ne ok ondik kare, bang' mano wabiro yango odiechieng' ma wabiro romo gi ker.”
But there had been another hurdle to the process. 	E dwe mar  Februar jong'ad bura abich ne ogeng'one Ker Kenyatta mondo kik oket seyi e Chik ma ne idhi kal gi Od Bura Moriw.
In February, a five-judge Bench had barred President Kenyatta from assenting to the Bill should it be passed by the bicameral Parliament. 	Kata kamano, nitie gimachielo ma ne oriwo ne chenrono e yo.
Thirdway Alliance lawyers had applied to have the National Assembly and the Senate barred from acting on the resolutions by county assemblies.	Okinde mag Thirdway Alliance  ne okwayo ni otam Od Bura mar Kenya kod Senet mondo kik gitim kaka jo od bura mag kaunti ong'ado.
They ruled that the amendments would not come into force until determination of the petitions challenging the process. 	Ne ging'ado ni ok bi tim lokruok moro amora e chik nyaka tiek winj kwayo mag joma ne kwedo chenrono.
Justices Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Chacha Mwita and Teresiah Matheka issued the orders following an application by Thirdway Alliance, a week ago in Nakuru.	Jong'ad bura Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Chacha Mwita and Teresiah Matheka ne ogolo chikno bang' jo Thirdway Alliance tero kwayogi Nakuru.
Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi, who has been spearheading the unity talks and the clamour for a Coast political party accused MPs of frustrating his efforts. 	Gavana ma Kilifi Amason Kingi mosebedo ka jiwo wach kelo winjruok kod bedo gi pati mar siasa achiel mar jo Nam Chumbi, ne owacho ni Jobunge ok riwe lwedo.
With unity talks on the brink of collapse, the Coast Region is perhaps coming full circle, with its leadership repeating the errors that have for decades hindered the desired political unity.	Wuoyo mosebedoe mag kelo winjruok e kindgi Jo Nam Chumbi koro dhi ka kethore. Chalo kagima weche dhi mana nwoyore. Jotelo mag alwora mag Nam Chumbi dhi nwoyo gik mosetamo jo Nam Chumbi kelo winjruok e kindgi kuom higni pieche.
It has emerged that traditional turf wars, mistrust or selfishness among Coast leaders and the influence of upcountry votes have impeded the region’s quest to unite ahead of next year’s elections.	Gima tamo jo Nam Chumbi bedo gimoro achiel kapok yiero ma higa mabiro ochopo gin gik matimore e kind jotendgi, kaka ywaruok mag telo ma nyaka nene, bedo ni ok gigenore kendo ng'ato ka ng'ato manyo mana ber makore.
Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi, who has been spearheading the unity talks and the clamour for a Coast political party or coalition, appears to have thrown in the towel, accusing MPs of frustrating his efforts.	Nenore ni Gavana ma Kilifi Amason Kingi, mosebedo ka jiwo wach kelo winjruok kod bedo gi pati mar siasa achiel mar jo Nam Chumbi  kata riwruok mar pati mogwaro, koro ool kendo ogo bade piny kowacho ni jobunge ok riwe lwedo.
“I have tried to bring Coast MPs for talks but some have been uneasy with the idea,” said Kingi, adding that the unity talks have been misconstrued to be his personal political agenda.	Kingi wacho niya: “Asetemo mondo ariw jobunge mag Nam Chumgi mondo giwuo, to moko kuomgi ok ni thuolo.” Ne omedo ni ji paro ni mbaka mag kelo winjruok gin mana gik mowuondorego to odwaro mana chopo chenroge mag siasa.
The signs of the collapse of the talks emerged in early April after Kingi and his Mombasa counterpart Hassan Joho held parallel meetings with Coast leaders.	Achiel kuom gik ma ne nyiso ni chenro mag kelo winjruok ne dhi ka wuo, ne en gima ne otimore e chak dwe mar April. Kingi notimo chokruok moro mar loso winjruok to gie kindeno, Hassan Joho be ne timo chokruok mare  kamachielo.
On April 9, talks between Kingi and officials of fringe parties in the region also hit a snag over the differences on whether they should dissolve and merge into a single party or form a coalition.	April tarik 9, mbaka ma ne dhi nyime e kind Kingi kod opisa mag pati matindo tindo bende ne omoko kane ok ginyal yie kabe onego giketh pati matindogo kendo gilos pati maduong' kata giriw ariwa patigo.
After a two-day meeting at Mnarani Hotel in Kilifi, the officials of Kadu Asili, Shirikisho Party of Kenya and Umoja Summit Party of Kenya (USPK) rejected Kingi’s push for them to dissolve.	Bang' chokruok mar ndalo ariyo ma ne otim Mnarani Hotel, Kilifi, Opisa mag  Kadu Asili, Shirikisho Party of Kenya kod Umoja Summit Party of Kenya (USPK) ne ok oyie gi  Kingi ni oketh patigo mondo olos pati achiel.
Former Cabinet Minister Morris Dzoro, who is the Shirikisho Party leader, Kadu Asili Chairman Joshua Kombora and his USPK counterpart Matano Chengo have vowed never to dissolve the parties.	Morris Dzoro, Jatend Tij Sirkal macho ma bende en jatelo mar Shirikisho Party, Joshua Kombora ma en Jakom mar Kadu Asili kod Matano Chengo ma en Jakom mar USPK  ne osingore ni ok gibi ketho patigi ngang'.
But Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya appears to have revived the talks.	Kata kamano, nenore ni Gavana ma  Kwale Salim Mvurya osechako kendo mbaka mag kelo winjruokgo.
However, in a recent interview, he delinked his meetings with the leadership of the fringe parties to Kingi’s plans.	Kata kamano, e mbaka moro ma ne obedogo machiegnini, ne owacho ni wach telo mag pati matindo tindo ok owuoye nimar mago gin chenro mag Kingi.
Although Joho, Kingi and Mvurya have held several meetings, they all appear to be reading from different scripts. 	Kata obedo ni  Joho, Kingi kod Mvurya osebedo gi chokruoge mogwaro e wi riwo jo Nam Chumbi, nenore ni giduto gidwaro kelo winjruokno e yore mopogore opogore.
Joho has vowed to unite Coast under ODM, Kingi through a new party while Mvurya hopes to rally the region behind Deputy President William Ruto.	Joho wacho ni obiro riwo jo Nam Chumbi duto mondo gibed e pati mar ODM, Kingi to wacho ni obiro timo kamano kokalo kuom pati achiel manyien ma gidwaro loso, to Mvurya to dwaro choko Jo Nam Chumbi duto mondo giriw lwedo jalup ker William Ruto.
Coast MPs, on the other hand, accuse Kingi of failing to articulate the agenda of his proposed political pact.	Komachielo, Jobunge ma Nam Chumbi wacho ni Kingi ok ket maler chenroge mag siasa e wi wach winjruok modwarono.
“In as much as we embrace the idea of Coast unity, we cannot be subjected to uncalled for intimidation by agents of mistrust and individualism,” said Ganze MP Teddy Mwambire.	Teddy Mwambire ma en Jabunge ma Ganze ne owacho niya; “En adier ni dwaher mondo alwora mar Nam Chumbi obed gimoro achiel, kata kamano, ok dwayie mondo ochikwa kod joma ok ogeno jowetegi kendo ma manyo mana ma korgi.”
Mwambire, who is also the Secretary of the Coast Parliamentary Group, said Kingi should go back to the drawing board and “clear the grey areas”.	Mwambire ma en Jatelo mar Coast Parliamentary Group, wacho ni Kingi onego ochak olos chenrone maber kendo oket weche duto e ler.
Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir said Kingi failed to tell the Coast what the new political party stands for, claiming that “he wanted to use it for his personal gains”.	Abdulswamad Nassir ma en Jabunge ma Mvita ne owacho ni Kingi ne ok owacho ne Jo Nama Chumbi gima pati manyien mar siasano dwaro chopo. Ne owacho ni Kingi dwaro tiyo gi patino mondo ochwalgo chenroge owuon.”
The idea of the Coast party has over the years sparked apprehension among upcountry voters in the region, largely due to the region’s history on majimbo or federalism ideologies.	Wach bedo gi pati achiel mar Jo Nam Chumbi osekelo luoro moro ne jo go ombulu ma alworano nikech kaka weche ne odhi  marach e kinde mokalo kane ji omakore gi weche majimbo kod wach mar ni Jo Nam Chumbi onego obed gi loch margi matin.
These ideologies were blamed for 1997, 2005 and 2012 xenophobic killings of non-locals by criminal gangs like the Kaya Bombo, Mlungu Nipe and the Mombasa Republican Council (MRC).	Wachore ni wechego ema ne okelo nek ma ne obedoe e higni mag  higni mag 1997, 2005 kod 2012 , ma ne ji chich kod joma ok owuok e ogendnigi kendo negogi.

In 2017 polls, eight of the 30 MCAs elected in Mombasa trace their ancestry to counties outside Coast. This was an increase from five in 2013.	E yiero mar 2017, kuom Jo Od Bura 30 mag kaunti ma ne oyier Mombasa, 8 ne ok owuok e kaunti mag Nam Chumbi. Mano ne en medruok mar 5.
The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) records also show that five of the 12 nominated MCAs in Mombasa have an upcountry lineage. In 2013 they were two.	Nonro mag Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) bende nyiso ni kuom Jo Od Bura 12 ma Od Bura ma Mombasa oyiero, 12 owuok e mier ma oko. E higa mar 2013, ne gin mana ji ariyo.
Statistics show that the number of aspirants from the upcountry vote bloc, who contested for various seats in Mombasa, grew in the 2017 elections compared to 2013. 	Nonro nyiso ni kwan mar joma chung' mowuok e gwenge ma oko ma ne olaro kombe mag Mombasa ne omedore e higa mar 2017 kopim kod ma ne ochung' e higa mar 2013.
“It could be a good or bad thing. It is also breeding clannism that has exposed us to manipulation like in the last elections,” said Evans Mayaka.	Evans Mayaka wacho niya: “Onyalo bedo gima ber kata gima rach. Bende okelo wach anyuola to mano miyo itiyo kodwa e yo ma ok ber kaka e yiero mosekalo.”
Mayaka, who unsuccessfully vied for the Shanzu Ward seat in 2017, said there has been a sharp rise of upcountry voters in most parts of Mombasa, leading to an increase in the number of aspirants.	Mayaka, ma ne olaro kom mar Shanzu Ward e higa mar 2017, to ne ok oyudo, wacho ni kwan mar joma goyo ombulu mowuok e mier ma oko osemedore e alwora mang'eny mag Mombasa kendo mano ema omiyo joma wuok kuno ka dwaro kombe bende omedore.
Prof Hassan Mwakimako of Pwani University says because of the increasing number of active upcountry voters, Coast leaders are forced to remain loyal to parties from outside the region.	Profesa Hassan Mwakimako ma Pwani Yunivasiti wacho ni nikech kwan joma goyo ombulu mowuok e mier medore, mano chuno Jotelo mag alwora mar Nam Chumbi mondo omakre gi pati mamoko ma ok mag alworano.
For instance, he said, in Lamu West Constituency, aspirants from political parties with roots in central Kenya have a headstart because of the Mpeketoni vote bloc.	Kuom ranyisi e Lamu West Constituency, jo Central malaro kombe mag siasa nyalo locho mayot nikech ombulu mawuok Mpeketoni.
Dominated by the Kikuyu community, Mpeketoni boasts of over 17,000 voters that influence the elections in Lamu West and Lamu County in general.	Nikech Jo  Kikuyu ema ng'eny kuno, Mpeketoni sungo ombulu 17,000  kendo mago mako kama duong' e yiero mag Lamu West kod Kaunti duto mar Lamu.
Mwakimako said in Mombasa, leaders align themselves with either ODM or Wiper because of the high number of Luo, Luhya, Kamba and Kisii voters.	Mwakimako ne owacho ni e alwora mar Mombasa, jotelo makore gi ODM kata Wiper nikech ombulu mang'eny mag Jo Luo, Jo Luhya, Jo Kamba kod Jo Kisii.
“The upcountry vote is not unified but in urban areas like Mombasa and where there is a significant population, it is a sway vote because they add the tally for politicians allied to them,” he said.	Ne owacho niya, “E mier ma okogo ji ok riwre e goyo ombulu, kata kamano, e taonde  kaka Mombasa, kod kuonde ma jo ma kamago ng'enyie, ombulugigo konyo josiasa ma gigochone.”
The sentiments were echoed by Prof Halim Shauri who said upcountry voters usually vote with their compatriots in their areas of origin, hence Coast has a hard time dropping upcountry parties.	Profesa Halim Shauri riwo lwedo wechego, owacho ni joma nie mier jo go ombulu kanyachiel gi jowetegi ma giwuokgo e mier achiel, omiyo ok yot mondo josiasa ma Nam Chumbi ojwang' pati manie mier.
Shauri said the upcountry voters are “faithful” to their ethnic leaders, but politicians from the region should go an extra mile, including alignment to political parties, to win them.	Shauri ne owacho ni joma wuok e mier ma goyo ombulu makorega gi jotelo mowuok e ogendnigi kata kamano, josiasa mawuok e alworago nyaka tim kinda mondo eka giyud ombulugigo moriwo  makruok kod pati mag siasa.

Ulinzi with Kenya national team players Victor Bosire, Eric Mutoro and James Mwangi could not match the lakeside team as they registered their first defeat of the season.

Point guard Victor Bosire led for the Warriors with 19 points followed by William Ochieng with 18 points as Erick Mutoro and James Mwangi registered eight points each.

The host dominated the first two quarters, leading 20-17 and 15-12 respectively before Ulinzi came back into the game with an impressive 20-13 score in the third quarter.	Jo dala ne otelo e tugo no e qwota mokwongo gi mar ariyo gi point 20-17 gi 15-12 moro ka moro kapok Ulinzi oduogo oduogo e tugo g nyisruok maber gi 20-13 e kwota mar adek.

Lakeside started the game on a high note with Awuor hitting two consecutive dagger threes to finish the first quarter with 11 points followed by Justus Okitoyi and Kennedy Okumu with seven and two points respectively to lead the quarter 20-17.

Forward Odhiambo came in hard in the second quarter dropping eight points as Ulinzi struggled to convert from the three-point line which allowed Lakeside to take a six-point lead at the break with the scores at 35-29.	Jambele Odhiambo ne odonjo matek e kwota mar ariyo kolwaro point aboro sama Ulinzi chandore mondo olokre e thuolo mar point adek mane oyie ne Lakeside mondo okaw telo mar point Auchiel e sach yueyo gi gonde kochung' e 35-29.
The defending champions however responded with four consecutive threes shared equally by Mutoro and Bosire in the third quarter and Ochieng adding five more as Ulinzi took the lead for the first time in the match leading 49-48 by the end of the quarter.

In the final quarter, captain Guya took matters into his own hands to seal the win with nine points as Odhiambo added four points to narrowly win 61-59 after Mutoro missed a late layup to send the game to overtime.

Speaking after the win, Lakeside coach Brian Lusaga congratulated his players for not giving up in the last quarter, saying they are just getting started.	Kane owuoyo bang loch, japuonj mar Lakeside Brian Lusaga ne opuoyo jotuke kuom rem goyo badgi piny e kwota mogik, kowacho ko eka gichako.
“We believed in ourselves from the start and that was clear after coming out on top in the first, second and final quarters. This is a good win against a talented Ulinzi side and this result will really boost us going forward,” Lusaga told the Standard Sports.	"""Ne wageno kuomwa wawegi ae chakruok to mano nenore e lela ka ne wawuok malo e tielo mokuongo gi mar ariyo mag tuke mogik.

NBA-Players protest racial injustice as league returns to action	Jotugo mag opich okapu ng'anyo ne akwede mag dhoudi e sama lig duogo e tich.
NBA teams bowed their heads and knelt during the playing of the U.S. national anthem while wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts on Thursday as the league returned for the first time since the coronavirus halted play in March with two thrilling games.	Timbe mag NBA okulo wiye gi kendo ogoyo chonge gi piny sama iwero Ben mar pinje loka ka bende giruakore gi lewni mag Ngima Jarateng' be ochuno chieng tich Angwen e sa ma lig duogo e okang mokwongo chakre ne midhusi mag Corona chunge gi tuke ariyo ma thinginyi.
Coaches and game officials joined players from the Utah Jazz, New Orleans Pelicans and Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers in taking a knee to protest against racial injustice and police brutality in the first games in 140 days.

Black Lives Matter was also written on the courts at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in the Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando, where the NBA plans to finish its season with 22 teams inside a bio-secure bubble.	Ngima Jarateng' be Ochuno ne ondiki nyaka e alap mag tugo ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex ei Walt Disney machiegni gi Orlando, kama NBA ochano tiekoe go tuke gi mag sison, gi timbe 22 ei alap morit matek gi arita ma nyasani mar bio-secure bubble.
"""The game of basketball has always been bigger than just the ball, the rim, 10 guys on the floor and referees,"" the Lakers LeBron James said after hitting the game-winning shot in his team's 103-101 win over the Clippers."	"""Tugo mar opich okapu osega bedo maduong moloyo opira no owuon, okapu moloyoe, ji apar man e dier ot gi jo ta tugo ,"" LeBrone James ma ja Lakers nowacho bang goyo gol ma jokorgi loyo go tugo 103-101 ekindgi gi Clippers."
"""It's an opportunity to use this platform to spread a lot of positivity and love throughout the whole world."""	"""En thuolo ma ber kawo alap ni mar lando wach mar nyayo kwe kod hera e piny duto."""
He said that while there has been progress in the fight against systemic racism, the key was to maintain the momentum.	Ne owacho ni kata obedo ni dongruok osebedo e lweny mathiro akwede ma dhoudi madongo, ma duong'ne en riti teko no kok dog chien.
"""We want to keep our foot on the gas,"" he said. ""We're dealing with a lot of racism, a lot of social injustice and a lot of police brutality, not only in my neighborhood and not only with Black people, but with all people of color."""	"""Wadwa keto ntiendwa osik e mo,"" nowacho ni ""Waromo gi akwede mathoth, timbe mathoth mag dewo wang' kod ang'enge mathoth mag obila, ok mana e libamba na kende kendo ok mana gi jo ratenge, to gi ji duto ma jo rangi."
"Some players had messages like ""Equality,"" ""Education Reform"" and ""Say Their Names"" on the backs of their jerseys in place of their names."	"Jotugo moko ne nigi ote mondiki kaka ""Romruok"", ""Somo mag Puodhruok,"" ""Wach Nying gi"" e tok lepgi mag tugo mokawo kar nyinge gi."
Athletes from around the world have united behind anti-racism protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a Black man in police custody in Minneapolis in May.

In the first game, the Jazz came from behind to defeat the Pelicans 106-104 after the Pelicans' Brandon Ingram's three-pointer at the buzzer rimmed out.	E tugo mokwongo, jo Jazz nowuok chien moloyo Pelicans 106-104 bang ka gol mar jpointa adek mar ja Pelicans Brandon Ingram goyo oko mana ka buzzer yuak.
"The games are being played without fans, but ""virtual fans"" appeared on LED screens wrapped around the court and a simulation of a crowd's cheers and jeers could be heard."

How NBA restart today will work	Kaka chakruok kendo mar NBA kawuono biro tiyo.
The NBA relaunches its 2019-2020 season today with 22 teams based inside a secure “bubble” at Disney World in Florida due to complete the remainder of the campaign. 	NBA chako kendo ayanga  sison ne mar 2019-2020 kawuono gi timbe 22, ma oboyore ei abundu mag geng'o korona e Disney World e Florida mondo otiek bath kampen modong.
Here AFP looks at some of the key questions and issues surrounding the unprecedented restart:	Ka AFP ngiyo penjo kod weche moko madongo ma oluoro chakruok kendo, ma ne ok oikruokne.
From the moment the NBA season was halted in March after the pandemic brought the United States to a standstill, the NBA began looking at the question of how or if the season could be restarted safely.	Chakre sa mane sison mar NBA ochungi e dwe mar adek ka ne chandruok no osekelolo Pinje lLoka chung' kar tiendgi, NBA nochako rango kaka kata sison dichakre kendo manyien ma onge luoro mar landruok tuo.
The logistical challenges of restarting the season in its existing format, with large travelling groups of players and support staff jetting in and out of multiple cities at a time was deemed a non-starter in the era of Covid-19.	Pek ma ne nitie mar chako lig kendo manyien e  kit kaka chal mare obet, gi kidienje madongo mag jotugo mani ewuoth, gi jokony mangeny ma donjo kendo wuok oko mar bombe mangeny e kindeno ne one kaka kinde ma ok owinjore gi chako e kinde mag Covid-19.
Instead the NBA began exploring the feasibility of basing all teams at a single location, creating a giant quarantined safe zone or “bubble” and completing the season there.	"Komachielo, NBA nochako nono nyalruok mar choko timbe duto kamoro achiel, ka iloso kar bedo kend achiel maduong kata abundu ""bubble"" kae to itieko sison kanyo."
Las Vegas and Orlando quickly emerged as the front-runners, with the NBA eventually opting for the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida as the best venue.	Las Vegas kod Orlando piyopiyo ne owuok kaka joring nyime, ka NBA gikone to oyiero ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex ma ni Walt Disney World ei Orlando, Florida kaka kar romo maber  moloyo.
Twenty-two teams are now based in the campus, with players requiring to test negative for Covid-19 twice after arrival before being allowed to enter.	Timbe 22 koro sani ni e kar ute tiegruok go, ka jotugo to idwaro ni mondo opim nyadiriyo ka gichopo to pim duto nyaka fweny ni gionge Covid-19 kapok oyienegi gidonjo.
Team and NBA personnel are staying in three hotels dotted throughout the complex, with a small number of media, sponsors and inactive players. 	Tim kod oganda mag NBA dak e magawa adek ma oduong'o kuonde duto ei kama ogajore no, mana gi matin kuom jo fwambo gi keyo, jo sir tuke go kod jo tugo ma ok tugi.
Games will take place without fans at three different venues on the complex.	Tuke ibiro tim ma onge johera gi joneno mag tukego e pewe adek mopogore opogore ekama ogajore no.
In the early weeks of the restart, no guests will be allowed although those rules will be relaxed once the playoffs start.	E jumbe momondo mag chakruok manyien no, onge welo ma ibiro yienegi to kata kamano chike ibiro mbeki ka tuke osechakore.
After the first round of the playoffs, players will be allowed to reserve one hotel room each for guests, who will be required to self-quarantine for seven days. 	Bang' nyoluoro mokuongo mag chak tuke go, jotugo ibiro yienegi mondo owe tenge od magawa achiel moro ka moro ne welo ma bende ibiro dwaro ni mondo obed kar kendgi giwegi kuom ndalo abiryo.
Any guests entering the bubble must also test negative twice for Covid-19 in the 72 hours before entering. 	Wendo moro amora ma donjo e abundu (bubble) nyaka pim nyadiriyo duto manyiso duoko mag onge mar Covid-19 e bwo seche 72 ka pok odonjo.
Any guests testing positive will not be allowed to enter.	Wendo moro amora ma pim ne nyiso ni en gi midhusi ok noyiene donjo.
Those guests who are admitted will be required to undergo daily testing.	Welo ma orwaki ibiro timonegi pim pile.
Players are allowed to leave the bubble in exceptional circumstances but face a mandatory four days in quarantine before being readmitted. 	Jotugo inyalo yienegi wuok oko mar abundu go, e bwo chal ma moko ma ok nyal geng, to ka giduogo to nyaka gibed kar kendgi e bwo achune kuom ndalo angwen kapok orwakgi kendo.
Players must also undergo daily testing when they leave the site.	 Jo tugo bende nyaka kadh e pim ma pile pile ka giwuok oko mar kar bedo no.
The regulations have already tripped up two NBA players -- the Los Angeles Clippers’ Lou Williams was ordered to serve a 10-day quarantine after visiting an Atlanta strip club during a family emergency leave.	Chike go osekiero oko jotugo ariyo mag NBA--ja Los Angeles Clippers Lou Williams ne o chik ni mondo obed kar kende kuom ndala 10  bang timo limbe eod miel duk moro man Atlanta e kinde mag yueyo ma apoya mar anyuola.
Williams was photographed at an Atlanta strip club which he said he visited to get some take out food.	Williams ne ogo picha ka en e od miel duk ma atlanta no ma ne owacho ni ne odhiye mana manyo chiemo ma idhi godo oko.
Richuan Holmes of the Sacramento Kings was also hit with a 10-day quarantine order after leaving the campus to pick up a delivery of chicken wings.	Richuan Holmes ma Sacramento Kings bende ne ogo gi ndalo 10 mar bedo kar kend e yor achune bang wuok e kar bet no kendo dhi oko mondo okaw bwombe gwen mane okowne.
LeBron James joked that leaving his home to enter the bubble was like “heading to do a bid” -- a slang term for starting a prison sentence.	"LeBrone James wacho eyor oyuma ni wuok e ode kendo dhi donjo abundu go chalo mana ""dhi goyo nengo""--wach oyuma ma mar chako tuech e jela."
But since arriving in Orlando, most players have adjusted to life in their tightly controlled environment.	To nyaka ne gidonj Orlando, jotugo mathoth ose ngiyo gi ngima mar dak kuonde gi e bwo arita ma oridore no.
Many have installed creature comforts from home including giant televisions and video game consoles.	Ngeny gi oseketo kwe mar teko odago le kowuok e dala kaka nyakalondo mag TV magongo, gik tuke mag video.
A Twitter account -- @nbabubblelife -- which documents the daily activities of NBA players based in Orlando has quickly amassed a large following, depicting players doing everything from getting haircuts to playing golf or fishing.	Yor tudruok mar tweeter--@enbabubblelife--ma ndiko gik ma jotugo mag NBA timo pile pile Orlando piyopiyo nono oseyudo yawa modhuro maluwe, ma nyiso gimoro amora ma jotugo timo chakre lielo wich nyaka tugo tuke golf kata luwo rech.
Despite being inside the bubble, players are still required to follow conventions such as social distancing and wearing face coverings.	Kata obedo ni gin ei abundu, jotugo pod idwaro ni mondo olure gi chike kaka bedo mabor gi nyawadu kod rwako gik geng'o pat wang'.
Players are also barred from entering each other’s rooms.	Jotugo bende ogeng' ne gi donjo e ute jowetegi.
Twenty-two teams will complete the season -- 13 from the Western Conference and nine from the Eastern Conference.	Timbe piero ariyo gi ariyo biro tieko sison--13 kowuok e bwo log riwruok ma Yimbo, ka ochiko to owuok e bwo log riwruok ma Ugwe.
Invited teams include the 16 franchises who were in the playoff positions when the league halted play in March, plus six teams that were six games or fewer behind the eighth seed in each conference.	Timbe ma ogwel otingo 16 ma ochwal ka ni e thuolo mag chaka tugo e sama lig ne ochungie, to gi auchiel moko ma ne ni chien gi tuke auchiel kata matin nemano e tok kodhi mar aboro kawuok e log riwruok moro ka moro.
Teams will start off with seeding games to determine the final playoff line-up, with the playoffs starting on August 17, when each round will be best of seven.

Meanwhile, the Utah Jazz and New Orleans Pelicans reportedly are working together on a plan to kneel during the national anthem and show support for the Black Lives Matter movement before they square off.	E sechego, Utah jazz, gi New Orleans Pelicans duto wachore ni chano dhi goyo chong gi kanyakla e pap e kinde ma ibiro goyoe ben mar piny kendo koro gisiro wuodh Ngima Jarateng' bende ochuno kapok gichako rakore.

Kenyan film 'Softie' picked for Peabody awards	Filimb Kenya ma 'Softie' okwany mar yudo mich mag Peabody.
Kenyan film ‘Softie’ has been nominated for the 2021 Peabody Awards in another cheer for the 2020 hit documentary. 	Filim mar Kenya 'Softie' oyier mondo oyud mich mag Peabody mar 2021 e pak moro machielo mar mbaka mag adiera mane onyiso mane oher ahinya e higa 2020.
The Peabody Awards Board of Jurors based at the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia announced its 60 nominees representing “the most compelling and empowering stories released in broadcasting and streaming media” in 2020.	"Jo ngad wach mag Mich mag Peabody ma log tich gi ni e kar somo ma Grady mar somo mag Fwambo gi keyo e Mbalariany mar Georgia nolando ji 60 ma gikwanyo ma chung' ne "" mbekni ma sigo kendo jiwo ji ma ogol e yor lendo ma achiel ka achiel e kuonde lendo kata kokalo e yore mbuyi"" e 2020."
From more than 1,300 submissions for the prestigious award, only 60 stories were selected and ‘Softie’ made the cut.	Koa kuom mokalo kwayo 1300 mag dwaro mich mar Nyadhi malich no, mana mbekni 60 kende ema ne okaw to Softie ne oyudore eiye.
When the news of the nomination broke, ‘Softie’ director Sam Soko was ecstatic, writing on Facebook: “I am so proud of our fantastic Softie the film team... Mad love to the crew, incredible supporters, and Boniface and Njeri Mwangi (the subjects of the film). Thank you! Congratulations to the other amazing nominees.”	"Esama lendo mar yiero no nowuok, Sam Ooko ma en e ja ta chenro mar Softie ne oponng' gi mor, kondiko e mbuyi mar facebook: ""An gi nyadhi mangeny ahinya ne jowa malich mag filim mar Softie…Hera mar neko ne jo kanyakla wa, josir magwa ma lich ahinya, gi Boniface kod Njeri Mwangi (jotugo e filimbno)Ero uru kamano! Puoch gi pak ne joma moko ma bende ne oyier."""
The Peabody Awards honour excellence in storytelling that reflects the social issues and the emerging voices. 	Mich mag Peabody go chiwo nyadhi ne lony mar goyo mbaka ma menyo weche mag oganda kod duonde mawuok.
“It is really exciting to be nominated because it means this is an African story that has reached a global audience. A good story has no colour or race. We are honoured to be among other honourable nominees and we hope to win,” said Boniface Mwangi.	"""En mor maduong ahinya ka oyieri nikech mano nyiso mni ma mbaka mar Africa ma osedonjo e it jowinjo ma pinje ma oko. Mbaka maber onge gi rangi kata dhoodgi. Wan gi nyadhi maduong kuom bedo ekind joma oyier mamoko kendo wageno mar loyo,"" Boniface Mwangi nowacho."
Speaking to The Standard last year as the film won accolade after accolade, Soko said the hit documentary started as a simple idea.	Ka owuoyo gi The Standard higa mokalo ka ne filim no yudo mich mar luor makende moro bang moro, Soko nowacho ni mbaka ma rahuma no nochakore mana ka paro moro matin.
“When we stared it was not meant to be a documentary. We were just filming the process of the protests he was leading in 2013. It was sort of supposed to be a how-to-guide. Like an activism manual. Something short that could go on Youtube and that would be it,” he said.	"Ne owacho ni, ""Kane wachako nyise, ne ok ochane ni mondo obed mbaka malich. Ne wamako mana kaka yo ma otelo ne go ng'anyo e 2013. Ne en mana gi ma ne onego nyis kaka itayo gimoro. Mana kaka gima nyiso kaka itayo nganyo kata dwol mar siro. Gimoro matin ma ne nyalo mana dhi e mbuyi mar Youtube to mano oromo aroma,"""
But as time went on we realised it was very interesting to see what happens behind the scenes when Boni does something.	To kaka ndalo ne medo dhi,ne wafwenyo ni omit ahinya neno gik matimore e tok tipo ka Boni timo gimoro.
Yes, he is an activist, but he is also a father and a husband and there are demands made of him for those roles.	Ee en ja ta nganyo to bende en wuoro kendo dichuo kendo nitie dwache moko ma ochwalo ga e wi tijego.
We never actually get to see the consequences. 	Ok wayud ga thuolo mar neno gik ma wuokie bang timbego.
The Peabody Board of Jurors announced this year’s crop of nominees on May 4, listing ‘Softie’ alongside ‘Athlete A’ and ‘Disclosure’ among 16 others in the documentaries segment.	Jo ngad wach mag Mich mag Peabody nolando jok ma oyier mag higani chieng tarik4, dwe mar Abich, ka giriedo  'Softie' kaachiel gi 'Athlete A' kod 'Disclosure' e kind 16 ma moko e kidieny mar mbaka an gi adiera.
When he and his family get death threats, that this is what it actually means.	Sama en kata anyuola ne yudo buok mag nek, mano ema nyiso koro gima gini en.
HBO’s 'I May Destroy You', Amazon Studios’ 'Small Axe', and Showtime’s 'The Good Lord Bird' also received recognition from Peabody, as did CBS’ 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert'.

Chakacha got resurgent interest from dancer Princess Farida via her pelvic pirouette in transparent waist wrap around, paving way for solo artiste, Nyota Ndogo (Mwanaisha Abdallah), who infused pop to create an urban Taarab and Chakacha beat in the 2000s.	chakacha nodwaro ng'eyo matut kowuok kuom ja miel nyar kingi Farida koluore gi lau maneotueyo e a luora mar nungone, mane ochiwo thuolo ne jawer achiel,Nyota Ndogo (Mwanaisha Abdallah}, mane omiyo pop
That notwithstanding, Chakacha has rarely been copied by musicians beyond the coast, like say benga which was adapted by musicians from Western, Eastern and Central Kenya.	mae ka ok odew, chakacha ma pok obedo ka isumo kod jothumbe mokalo nam chumbi, kaka benga mane jothumbe ma imbo,ugwe kod kenya madiere ne osumo.
Even Them Mushrooms and Nyota Ndogo moving and pitching tent in Nairobi did not give Chakacha an urban appeal.	kata jo Them Mushrooms kod Nyota Ndogo dhii kendo guro hema ei Nairobi ne ok omiyo jo chakacha milumb boma.
But why did this genre, which borrows from Swahili, Arab and Persian belly-dancing influences, remain rooted at the coast?	To ang'o ma omiyo kit thum, mane osum kowuok e oswayo,Arabu kod pasia kod miel mar bund ich ne odong' koguroree yo kanam chumbi.
Never mind that the most popular Kenyan songs are from the coast: Malaika, the global evergreen was by Grant Charo and Fadhili Williams.	kik idew ni ng'eny thumbe mo ng'ere kenya gin mawuok nam chumbi:Malaika,The global evergreen mar Grant Charo kod Fadhili Williams.

With such rich legacy, why did Chakacha not spread to other parts of Kenya? There are many reasons, including culture, religion, perceptions, colonialism and changing musical tastes.	kolure kod sigana momeo,ang'o ma omiyo jo Chakacha ne ok olandore ei kenya mangima? Nitiere gik mathoth momiyo kaka kitwa kod timbewa,yoro wa mag lemo,pachwa,tend jo wagunde kod lokruok e dwaro mag thumbe.
Culturally, Chakacha was specific to women and dancing was a central element. “Men (were) not allowed to dance Chakacha and a man was considered gay when found dancing Chakacha,” says Dr Donald Otoyo, director, Permanent Presidential Music Commission.	"kolure gi kitwa kod timbewa,Chakacha ne ong'ere kaka mar mine kod miel mane en chunye wachno,""Chuo( ne) ok oyienegi mielo Chakacha to dichuo mane omielo Chakacha ne ikawo ka dhako,"" owachgi Laktar.Donald Otoyo jata chenro, kendo kamisen mongirore mar weche mag thumbe ker."
Again, Chakacha required a live band whose members had dexterity with coastal instruments most of them percussive like the chapuo, the msondo drums, the marimba and wind ones like the siwa trumpet.	Kendo, Chakacha nedwaro thum ma achiel kachiel ma joge ne nigi lony e tiyo gi gik thumbe ma wuok yo ka nam chumbi kaka Chapuo,bunde Msondo,Marimba kod tarumbete mikudho.
Matters were made worse by their near zero mastery of coastal music song craft of messages couched in proverbs and belted out in lilting Kiswahili accent.	weche ne omedo bedo matek koluwore gi kia mar thumbe ma dho nam chumbi gi oote mag gi mag ngeche kod ranyisi mar gi e dho oswayo.
In Sura Yako, all-boy band Sauti Sol borrowed Chakacha beats but that’s as far as its influence went.	E Sura Yako, band mar jawuoyi - duto Sauti Sol ne osumo kit thum mar Chakacha to mano e bor mane gi nyola chopoe.
Chakacha is also hardly played even when national days are held in Mombasa. 	 Chakacha ok thor tugo kata mana e nyasi mag piny mobagi nam chumbi.
Dr Otoyo explains that “as a commission, we promote Chakacha in the right settings. We use music for the right space, on a national day there are some music we can’t play, not because we do not support them but because it doesn’t suit the occasion. Music has to go with the occasion.”	"Lactar Otoyo lero ni ""kaka kamisen watemo dhiro nyime Chakacha e yore mowinjore. Watiyo gi thum e thuolo mowinjore,nitie kit thumbe ma ok nyal tugi e nyasi mag piny,ok nikech ok wanyal konyogi to nikech ok gi winjore gi odiochieng'no,thumbe mitugo nyaka lure gi odiochieng'no."
Philip Tuju, the founder of Red Fourth Chorus says Chakacha failed to take root beyond Mombasa because musicians who made it popular deviated to other genres: Safari Sounds still does the beach hotel music circuit but mostly plays popular cover versions and not Chakacha inspired songs like Pole Pole and Lala Salama that made them popular in the 1970s.	Philip Tuju mane ochako Red Fourth Chorus wachoni Chakacha ne orem kadho gwenge Mombasa nikech jo thumbe mane omiyo olandore ne oloko thumbegi e kido mag thumbe mamoko: Safari Sounds pod  goyo thumbe mag magawa molworo dho nam go, to githoro tugo mana moko ma ong'ere to ok thumbe ma kelo miyumo mag chakaca kaka Pole Pole gi Lala Salama ma ne omiyo gin'ere e higni mag 1970.
Mombasa Roots, which gave us Mama Sofia, all but fizzled out leaving Them Mushrooms whose last shot at recording was its Zilizopendwa compilation - more suited to easy listening than dancing.

Then there are historical reasons. Prof Larry Gumbe, an engineer and lay music historian argues in Shades of Benga Online that British constructing the Uganda Railway from 1895 entrenched colonialism which opened up Kenya’s hinterland to urbanity and with it, the spread of music.

Missionaries not only taught music but also consumed it but it was mostly European music, and even when they invited bands, they played the British Foxtrot. 	Jo misen ne ok opuonjo mana thumbe kende to bende ne gi tiyo kod gi to ngeny ne ne mana thumbe jo wagunda go, to kata ka ne giluongo ga band to ne gigoyo mana dwol machiko kor Britain.
Society was also segregated and Africans were left out.	Gwenge bende ne opogi to jo Africa ne owe oko.
That the British hired Indians and not the coastal people as railway builders did not help in spreading Chakacha.  	Ni nekech Jo Britain nondiko  jo India to ok jo nam chumbi kaka joger reru ne ok okonyo e keyo thum Chakacha.
In Shades of Benga Online, Bettina Ng’weno, an Associate Professor of African-American studies at the University of California, Davis, says Kenya’s State of Emergency in 1950s Nairobi also influenced the spread of music. 	E Tipo mag Benga e Mbuyi , Bettina Ng'weno, Ngire mar kojolo e somo mag Afrika - Amerika e mbalariany ma California,Davis, wacho ni Bedo ebwo arita mager mar sirkal e seche mopim,e higa mag 1950 Nairobi be nonyayo landruok thumbe.
Movement of people was restricted. These restrictions enabled the dominant sound to emerge, not from Mombasa, but towns surrounding Nairobi like Murang’a and Ukambani.	Wuodhe mag ji ne oket e bwo chik, Chike go ne omiyo thumbe dwol ma ne gi teko nolandore, ok ka wuok Mombasa to mana bombe molworo Nairobi kaka Muranga gi piny jo Kamba.
The British controlled recording studios and were more charitable to politically friendly communities like the Luo who worked at railways, explains Prof Gumbe adding that this allowed musicians from Luo Nyanza to thrive with their versions of rhumba.	Jo British go ne tayo kuonde golo thumbe go to ne chuny gi ler gi jo mane muol e weche siasa kaka Joluo, mane otiyo e reru, Ngire Gumbe lero komedo ni mano nomiyo jothumbe ma ka luo Nyanza thuolo mar keyo thumbegi kido mag rumba.
This eclipsed other regions and genres which was not helped by the fact that “Kenyans were also picking World Music from Afro Cuban, Caribbean, South Africa’s Kwela and Congolese influences,” says Prof Ng’weno.	"""Ma ne ochako oumo gwenge ma moko ka bende luwore ni jo Kenya bende ne fwaro thumbe ma oko kaka mag,  Afro Cuban, Caribbean, Kwela mar jo South Africa gi  mag Congolese,"" Ngire Ng'weno nowacho."
Ngala Chome, a writer and historian, says colonialism was largely spread through Christianity which overshadowed Islam and the dominant music was thus European. 	Ngala Chome, ja ndniko kendo ja sigana, wacho ni tend jo wagunda ne onyayore ahinya to ka okalo kuom weche Kristo, mane oumo Islam kae to thum mane okwako alwora ndalo no ne koro en mag  Yuropian.
Chome argues that Christianity became the cultural frame for those who could not enter the “Arab-Swahili-Indian Ocean imagination” and this also influenced their musical choices, besides perceptions of the Swahili as more Arab than African.	"Chome Chwalo ni weche Kristo ne oduogo obedo sirni  mag kitwa gi timbewa ne joma ne ok nyal donjo e pach "" jo Arab -Swahili - Indian to mano bende ne oywayo gi e yiero kit thumbe magihero kowe tenge paro ma jo Swahili ni moloyo Arab to Arab moloya Africa."
Music also spread to the masses via radio but VoK (now KBC) English Service playing mostly European music and the programming did not help matters: Breakfast Club, Lunchtime Music, Beat Time, Sundowner and Late Date according to Elizabeth Omollo, the first homespun woman broadcaster in December 1970.	Thum bende nelandore ne ji kokalo e nyakalondo to VoK (sani KBC) to kor dho sungu ne goyo mana thumbe jo yurop, chenro no ne ok kony weche: chenro mag Breakfast Club, Lunchtime Music, Beat Time, Sundowner gi Late Date kaluwore gi Elizabeth Omollo,dhako ma nya dala mokuongo ma jalendo  ehiga mar 1970 dwe mar apar gariyo.
In Shades of Benga Online, Omollo says “we were not allowed to play African music,” as listeners were largely mzungus. “We played jazz, classical, country, ballet, opera and instrumental music.”	"E Tipo Mag Benga e mbuyi, Omollo wacho "" Ne ok oyienwa goyo thume Afrika,"" nikech jowinjo thoth gi ne gin mana jo wagunda. ""Ne wagoyo Jazz, Classical, Country, Ballet, Opera kod Instrumental music."""
Something else: Chakacha, for its sensual dance moves, was banned from the Kenya Music Festivals in the 1990s. 	Gimoro machielo,: Chakacha nekech miende ne itudo gi weche mag terruok, ne ochungi e piem mag weche thumbe mag sikunde e higni mag 1990.
Yet, Chakacha is not Chakacha without the suggestive belly dancing and gyration of hips.	To Chakacha to ok en Chakacha ka onge miel mag winyo nungo kod mino bam.
Tuju reckons that besides the absence of heavy hitter coastal bands, banning Chakacha from the Kenya Music Festivals did not help matters.	Tuju yie ni ka koweyo onge mar band ma pek ma igoyo yo nam chumbi, Chungo Chakacha e piem mag thumbe e sikunde ne ok okinyo weche.
Dr Isaiah Oyugi, chair, department of music and dance at Kenyatta University terms Chakacha as a style of music and dance performed as a ritual exclusive to coastal girls who were ripe for marriage.	Laktar Isaiah Oyugi, jakom, e gund  thum kod miel e mbalariany mar Kentatta fulo Chakacha kaka kaka kit thum gi miel mitimo kaka liswa moro mana gi nyi yo  nam chumbi mosepong' kendo oikore mar dhi katedo.
Being banned from the Kenya Music Festival, he argues, was to restrict it to a community which understood it as others would have misinterpreted its essence.	N'gade oko e piem mag thumbe mag Kenya, ojiwo ni ne en mondo kit thum no osik ir oganda ma ne wijo kendo ongeyo tiende maber nekech oganda moko dine ok otiyo kode maber.
Students are also not the ideal audience as Chakacha was for girls ripe for spousal picking and in music festivals.	Nyithind Sikul bende ok ne gin joma owinjore gi Chakacha nekech ne en mar nyiri ma osechiek ne kend e nyasi mag thumbe.
“The guidelines of music calls for them to perform a cultural song in its authentic way, which in the case of Chakacha is not something we want to communicate to the public,” says Dr Oyugi adding that “Chakacha was like a rite of passage, practised by the Amu of Lamu in seclusion.   	"""Chike mag thumbe dwaro ni mondo gitim mana wende mag oganda kitgi gi timgegi e kite kaka ne ochake, ma kaluwore gi Chakacha to ok en gima de waher kelo ne ji kamano,"" Laktar Oyugi nowacho ka omedo ni Chakacha ne en yo mar timo liswa mar kalo ji e tieng' ma nitimo gi oganda mar Amu kod Lamu ki gin."
Dr Otoyo also explains that Chakacha had religious connotations as Muslims separated genders such that men and women hardly gathered in the same place. 	Laktar Otoyo bende lero ni Chakacha ne ni gi kit din moko e eiye ka ne jo Islam pogo nyiri yorgi to chuoyorgi kendo ne ok giyud thuolo mar bedo kanyakla.
It was thus wrong to play it in clubs as “a song and a dance meant for one person was now being practised in front of over 100 men, and for the purpose of looking more sexual, women adopted a very transparent outfit for this dance, which initially was something more like a leso. 	Kamano ne en richo tugo thumno e kuonde goyo thum nekech wer ma ne mar ngat achiel koro igoyo enyim chwo 100, to nekech en temo bedo me ja terruok moloyo, mine ne manyone lewni ma temo keto dug gi oko ma ne thoro bedo gimoro kaka leso.
The exaggeration made it unfit for the public and even the music festivals,” where a Class Two pupil would also be watching a performer with a kibwebwe tied to the waist, gyrating suggestively.	Gik ma imedoe go nomiyo obedo ma ok owinjore gi ji ayanga, kata ne piem mag thumbe e sikunde kama ja kilas ariyo n enyalo yudore ka ong'iyo tuke go ka gitweyo kibwebwe e nungo gi to giwinyo nungo gi gi paro moro.
Barissa Dhidha, senior music instructor department of music at Kenyatta University adds: “Chakacha is banned in music festivals because it is inappropriate for an elderly examiner to watch a sensual dance by students, it does not bring out the moral value.”	"Barissa Dhidha, jachik thumbe maduong e kar wer gi thumbe mea mbalariany ma Kenyatta, nomedo ni ""Chakacha olorne oko mar piem  nekech ok owinjore ne ja non thum ma osebedo ngat maduong mondo one miende mag terruok ka imielo gi nyithindo."

This art has given birth to Nairobi’s new kings of graffiti and street art such as Bankslave, Daddo, Swift9, Smoki, Uhuru, Mr Detail, Chela, and Serm1 among others who have become a household name in the industry. Bankslave, was once referred to as “the founding father of Kenyan graffiti” by CNN. 	"Tij ni osenyuolo ruodhi manyien e Nairobi ma gin ruodhi mag grafiti, to gi jo gor wang apaya ma ongere kaka Bankslave, Daddo, Swift9, Smoki, Uhuru, Mr Detail, Chela, gi Serm1 kod mamoko ma osebedo nyinge mag ot e tijni.

“We met at WAPI (an underground hip-hop platform and movement) in 2006 as individual artists.

However, by the very nature of what they do, a lot of these artists have to remain anonymous. 	Kata kamano, kaluwore gi kit tije ma gitimo, Ng'eny jo bukogi nyaka sik mana ka opondo.
Graffiti is after all rooted in breaking rules. 	Grafiti kata kamano ongirore mana e ketho chike.

Street art is also sometimes used to include graffiti.	Ndiko kod buko mag wang yore gi seche moko itimoe grafiti bende.
“Using official government names kills the mystery behind the art and so does it do in exposing us to unlikely enemies, something we are weary of,” says Swift9, who declines to give his official name.	"""Tiyo gi nyinge Sirikal mag adieri ma on'ge ketho ga ma ling' ling' mag tijni, kendo keto wa e thuolo mager mar kethruok gi ji kod bedo gi jowasigu mathoth ma ok par, gimoro ma waol godo.""

“Using pseudo names sometimes give artists the freedom of being cheeky and mischievous without their identity being in the public,” adds Daddo, a 23-year-old Nairobi-based graffiti artist and muralist.	"""Tiyo gi nyinge ma opondo ma ok adiera miyowa thuolo mar bedo ja oyuma kendo ja mila ma ok omoyo nonro gi e lela,"" Daddo nomedo, ja higa 23 ma jandiko, jagoro, jabuko kendo ja grafiti ma Nairobi."
“I use art to convey messages about our society. This is what I do to educate and reflect on both the good and bad. To me, graffiti is a way of life,” Daddo says.

He says graffiti allows him to express his creative side. “To me graffiti is a medium which I use to advocate social change, protest and expression of a certain community desire. So you can imagine how impactful it is out here.”	"Owacho ni grafiti miye thuolo mar nyiso kore machielo mar riekni mathith.""Ne an to grafiti en yo ma atiyo go e jiwo lokruok ne timbe oganda, ng'anyo kata choro dwaro mag oganda machielo.

Kibera was strongly affected by the violence and political turmoil that engulfed Kenya after the previous election, so preventing a repeat of the crisis was their main objective,” writes Joel Artista on his website, www.joelartista.com.

Expensive art	Riekni ma nengo ne tek.
“Graffiti is very expensive. Unless we are working with a big organisation, most of the murals we create are funded through sale of merchandise such as T-shirts and canvas art. They advance the art and are also a source of revenue for the artists.	"""Ndiko kata buko mag grafiti nengo gi tek ahinya.

One of the most anticipated movies of 2020, then 2021: No Time to Die, a James Bond’s film series, has delayed their release due to the potential losses they could make if they decide to exclusively premier it on streaming video on demand as opposed to cinema releases.

Dhidha reckons banning Chakacha from the Music Festivals was not what prevented it from spreading beyond the Coast, rather, musicians “looked at other genres and moved from Chakacha, others might have just gone separate ways because the band leader formed his own group.” 	Dhidha yie ni golo Chakacha oko e nyasi mar piem mag thumbe ok ema ne omone landore mokalo yoo ka dho wadh nam chumbi, tomakmana ni jothumbe ne ongi'yo kit thumbe mamoko kendo giwuok giweyo Chakacha, ka moko to nyalo bedo ni ne odhi adhiya e yore gi mopogore nikec jatend band ne olose girupe owuon.

Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka trended after she withdrew from the 2021 French Open held at Stade Roland Garros in Paris from May 30 to June 13.

In a post on her social media, Osaka said she had been struggling with anxiety and depression, thus she was not able to attend press briefings on the tournament as per the contract. 	E andike mane oketo mbuyi ne mar anyuola, Osaka ne owacho ni osebedo ka oyuare gi midhiero mag paro kod chuny ma dan'ni, koro ne ok onyal chopo e nyim jofwambo gi keyo e mbaka mag dayo dhok kaka chik orak dwaro.
“I’ve often felt that people have no regard for athletes’ mental health, and this rings very true whenever I see a press conference or partake in one, “she said.

After facing backlash, she later explained her struggle with depression and anxiety. “The truth is I have suffered long bouts of depression since the US Open in 2018 and I have had a really hard time coping with that.”	"Bang' yudo gi ng'eng'ruok kod seyo, ne bang'e olero yuaruok ne gi midhier mag paro kod chuny madang'ni.

On May 30, Kenyan rugby player Dennis Ombachi opened up about being bi-polar and struggling with depression.	Chieng tarik 30 dwe mar Abich, Jatugo mar opich Agoko  Dennis Ombachi ne oyangore e lela ni en gi tuo mar wich gi midhiero mag paro.
“I am Dennis Ombachi, kind of an international rugby player and a guy who’s passionate about cooking. What many people don’t know is that I am medically diagnosed with bi-polar disorder,” he said on his twitter account.	"""An Dennis Ombachi, jatugo mar opich agoko e okang mar piny ngima kendo jahera mar tedo. Gima ji mang'eny ok ong'eyo en ni yande pimo mag thieth ne oyuda gi tuo mar wich,"" Ne owacho e mbuyi mare mar twita."
Ombachi said he could miss flights and was always blamed, yet he was struggling. 	Ombachi nowacho ni seche moko ne ndege nyaloga yombe kendo ne inyalo seye to ne onge ng'ama ong'eyo ni ohinyore.
“For many years, I have struggled with this and depression. I would usually disappear from social media and occasionally miss flights when I had made the national team. This behaviour was always blamed on me “just being Dennis”. What my coaches and teammates didn’t know was the kind of pain I was in,” Ombachi said.	"""Kuom higni mang'eny, aseyuara kode kaachiel kod midhiero mag paro. Ne seche moko anyalo ga wuok lal nono e tudruok mag mbuyi kendo ndege ne nyaloga yomba ka  aseloso kidieny mar jotugo mar pinywa.

He said he chose to share his story because many people are not willing to discuss mental health. “I advise those with a similar problem as mine to seek professional help.”	"Ne owacho ni oyiero goyo mbakane gi ji nikech thoth ji ok ohero ga wuoyo e wi tuoche mag paro.

In 2013, sportsman Daniel Adongo, 23, became the first Kenyan to ever play in the National Football League (NFL) in US.	E higa mar 2013 jatugo Daniel Adongo, jahiga 23, ne obedo ja Kenya mokuongo tugo e National Football League(NFL)  e piny Amerka.
But last year, Kenyans were shocked when Adongo shared videos of himself smoking what appeared to be marijuana and holding a bottle. 	To e higa mokalo, jokenya ne oyudo buok kane Adongo onyeo pichene owuon e lela ka ofuong'o yiro mar gima ne nenore kaka njaga kendo oting'o chupa elwete.

Former 800 metres Olympics gold medalist Winfred Bungei also had his experience with depression and addiction. In 2019, Bungei told the Olympic Channel podcast that alcoholism almost ended his life. 	Jang'wech mar Olympic ma jaloch midila mar dhahabu ma chon e ng'weye mag mita mia aboro, Winfred Bungei bende ne osebedo gi neno mare e midhiero mar paro kod sikruok e mer.

Bungei, who has since recovered, said the addiction escalated after retiring.	Bungei, ma nyaka kanyo ne osechango, ne owachoni sikruok e mer ne omedore bang' weyo tugo.(Rutaya)
“There are only three destinations for an alcoholic: You may end up in an institution which offers treatment. You may also go to jail for doing something stupid, or you will die. As Wilfred Bungei, I’ve gone through the institution. I am not interested in the other two - jail and death. And no one wants to go that direction anyway,” he said during an interview with a local media.	"""Nitie mana kuonde giko adek ne ja kong' nyalo gikie: Kar od thieth.

Bungei said the luxurious lifestyles many sportspeople live contribute to their downfall, especially for those who are not careful and who are unguided.	Bungei ne owacho ni ngima ma nengo ne tek ma jotugo dakie ga ema nyayo kethruok gi, ahinya to ne jogo ma ok otang' gi ma ok chiki.
“There is a lot of loneliness up there when an athlete is winning and success has filled their lives. They are easily lured into alcoholism, promiscuity and other destructive habits just to hide from reality,” Bungei said.	"""Nitie ng'ichno mang'eny ahinya malo kanyo ekinde ma jatugo loyo kendo mau mag dhi maber opong'o ngima gi.

Celebrated swimmer Michael Phelps shocked many when he shared his struggle with depression saying; “Really, after every Olympics, I think I fell into a major state of depression; I didn’t want to be in the sport anymore.”	"Ja abal mipwoyo ahinya Michael Phelps ne obwogo ji mang'eny ka ne onyenyo yuaruokne gi midhiero mag paro e lela kowacho; ""Adier bang' Olympic ka Olympic, aparo ni ne alwarga emidhiero maduong mag paro; ne ok adwar bedo e tuke go kendo."""

Marathoner Jemimah Sumgong, in 2019, called on Athletics Kenya (AK) to offer counselling to athletes, some of whom, she said, were facing tough times.

Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe was yesterday put to task to explain why it took him long to react to a report by the National Treasury faulting Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) spending.	Jatend migao mar thieth Mutahi Kagwe nyoro ne oket e orindi maliet mondo oler ane gima omiyo ne okawo kinde malach mondo ochiw duoko  ewi rupot mane ogol gi aguch omenda mar piny owacho ma ne osiemo yomyom e wi kaka duol ma choro gige thieth Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) ne jo otiyo gi omenda.
Appearing before the National Assembly Public Investments Committee (PIC), chaired by Mvita MP Abdulswamad Shariff Nassir, the CS was grilled to explain why he did not react immediately when he was seized of the report, which indicated that the ministry had surpassed the requisition budget.	Ka ochopo e nyim aput mar duol mar joket mwandu mag piny owacho (PIC) e od bura maduong, ma ochuoye kom gi jaod bura ma Mvita  Abdulswamad Shariff Nassir, ja tend migao no ne o chwak gi penjo mondo oler gima omiyo nne orem kawo ondamo mapiyo bang kane osemiye rupot ma ne wacho ni migao no osekalo kar kwan omenda mane oyie ne gi kwayo.
The committee also wanted to know why it to took the intervention of Treasury to reveal how much the agency had spent despite the Health ministry having an alternate board member at Kemsa who should share reports with his CS.	Duol no be ne dwaro ng'eyo gima omiyo ne  okawo mana od aguch omenda mar piny owacho mondo ofweny ni omenda maromo nade mane duol mar keyo gige thieth no osetiyo go kata obedo ni migao mar thieth ni gi jakanyo mare e aput mag jo KEMSA ma onego bed ni pidho ga jatend migao no gi wach.
The legislators wanted to know how the communication in the ministry works if indeed the health boss was in the dark concerning the issue despite his board representative constantly attending board meetings.	Jo od bura go ne dwaro ngeyo kaka chwalo weche timore ga e migao no kod ka dipo ni en adier ni jatend migao no ne ni e mudho kotudore gi weche go kata obedo ni jaote e loye ne bedo e buche duto ma ochwo gi jo KEMSA.
“Were you not briefed on what was happening in Kemsa despite having a representative, that is why Kenyans had to wait until the Treasury flagged off the expenditure issues?” posed Wajir East MP Amin Rashid Kassim.	"""Dibed ni ne ok miyi ga weche machuok e wi gik ma tomore KEMSA kata obedo ni jaote mari ne bedo e buche go , mano ema omiyo jokenya nyaka ne rit mana nyaka aguch omenda mag piny owacho ema chiw ywak e wi kaka omenda osetiyo kanyo?"" ne openje gi jaod bura ma Wajir Amin Rashid Kassim."
Ali failed to understand why the ministry did not see all the rot at Kemsa and inform the members of the public on time.	Ali ne orem ngeyo gima omiyo migao no ne ok ofwenyo otodo ma ne Ni KEMSA mondo gi nyis jopiny e sa mowinjore.
He questioned whether the CS was interested and had proper consultations with his officers in matters coronavirus and guidelines of how to handle the situation.	Ne openjo ka bende jatend migao no ne ni gi chuny kendo ka bende ne en e tudruok gi apisa mage e weche mag midhusi mag Corona to gi kaka ne owinjore chandruog no lo.
The lawmakers said they failed to understand why despite various board meetings, it never got to the CS’s attention that there was an issue and it had to take an insider to disclose exactly what was happening.	Jo los chike go ne owacho ni tamogi ngeyo kaka kata bang bedo gi romo thoth mag jo bod, ne ok nochopo e ng'eyo mar jatend migao no ni ne nitie weche, kendo ne okawo mana ja iye moro mondo oler gima timore.
According to Kagwe’s submissions, the ministry knew about the matter by a letter faulting Kemsa for overspending.	Kaluwore gi ler mochiw gi Kagwe, migao no ngeyo e wi wachno ka luwore gi oboke mar ote mane siemo kaka jo Kemsa osetiyo gi omenda mokalo.
The letter from the Treasury got to the ministry on June 22, 2020, and action was only taken after August 27. 	Oboke mar ote mowuok e aguch omenda no ne ochopo ne ochopo ne migao no tarik 22 dwe mar Auchiel higa 2020, to okang' ne okaw mana tarik 27 dwe mar Aboro.
“Is it fair to Kenyans that six months down the line, the ministry was not aware of exactly what was happening at Kemsa?,” asked Mandera East MP Hassan Omar.	"""Bende en gima ber gi jo Kenya ni dweche auchiel piny mwalo, migao ne pod kia kata gima dhi nyime e kemsa?""ne openj gi jaod bura ma Mandera East Amin Omar."
“I consider this as sleeping on your job. Since you waited for Treasury to flag off that there was an issue yet you are the right person to raise such issues,” charged Rashid. 	"""Akawo ma kaka nindo e tiji. Nikech ne irito nyaka aguch omenda ema onyiso ni gimoro rach to in e ng'at ma kare ma  ne onego bed ni inyiso weche ma kamago,"" Rashid ne ochwowo."
He added, “I consider that lack of leadership and governance from the CS.”	"Ne omedo ""Akawo mano kaka rem bedo gi chia mar telo makare  kor ka jatend migao."""
But in his response, the CS argued that it is not his role to oversight the parastatals that are run under him. 	To e dwoko mare jatend migao no no kwer ni ok en tijemar nono kaka duonde mag piny owacho ma ni e bwoye tiyo.
He maintained that his ministry cannot and did not micromanage Kemsa.	Omako ni migao mare ok nyal kendo ok ne ochuno tije mag Kemsa.
“We only offer guidelines and policy structures from the ministry. Treasury monitors and that is why they pointed that out,” he affirmed.	"""Wan wachiwo mana techo kod yore mag chike kowuok e migao.Aguch omenda ema nono ema omiyo ne gifwenyo wachno."
He, however, acknowledges that there was a problem in Kemsa and the ministry is determined to make sure it becomes a better agency.	Kata kamano oyie ni nitie chandruok e Kemsa kendo migao mare temo matek neno ni olokore duol maber moloyo.
“We are aware that we have problems and we will deal with it,” he promised.	"""Wang'eyo ni wan gi chandruok kendo wabiro yware kode,""ne ochiko."
Kagwe was also under fire for insinuating that the losses Kemsa is experiencing are as a result of a decrease in product prices.	Kagwe bende ne oyudore e bwo mach bang wacho ni lal ma Kemsa neno en kaluwore gi dok chien mar nengo gik moko.
Kagwe disclosed that the agency owes Sh2.9 billion debt in supplies but said this will be settled once all the remaining products are sold and the remaining balance cleared.	Kagwe ne oelo ni duond no nigi gowi maromo sh. billion2.9 e gik mokeyo to owacho ni mano ibiro losi ka ose usi mwandu duto modong' kendo chul gope mapod odong'.
“The prices of most products have now dropped due to an increase in supplies in the country. It is however not only Kemsa that increased their prices last year, other private institutions also hiked their prices. It was bound to happen and a lot of institutions will feel the same pain and incur the same losses,” he explained.	"""Nengo mag gik moko koro ose lwar kaluwore gi medruok mag gik moko e Kenya ka. To bende ok en mana Kemsa kende mane onedo nengo gik moko e higa mokalo, kuonde ma ok mag piny owacho bende ne ong'awo nengo gige gi. Ne en gima ne nyaka timre kendo kuonde ohelni mang'eny nyaka winj rem no kendo nyaka ne lal maromre gigi mago,"" ne olero."
His response puzzled the chair, who said “By the time of audit, most of the products were still at the warehouses. 	"Dwoko ne no ne omako dho jakom ma ne owacho ni ""Nyaka e kinde mag nonro, mwandu mathoth ne pod ni e ute keno."
Other state agencies in their submissions have indicated that there were able to buy the same items at lower prices and most opted not to buy from the Kemsa because their prices were way too high,” he noted.	"Duol ma moko mag piny owacho e chwalo mag gi osenyiso ne ginyalo nyiewo mandu ma kamago e nengo mayot, kendo ng'eny gi ne oyiero ni kik ginyiew koa kuom Kemsa nikech nengo gi ne malo miwuoro,"" ne owacho."
”It’s a bit premature for us to say that the reason why we are making these losses is that the prices at the time were high. The loss is created by greed. Some suppliers were given regrets by Kemsa and they went and supplied the same items to third parties and Kemsa secured the same items from those parties,” added. 	"""En gima ok otegno mondo wawach ni gima omiyo waneno lala en ni nengo ne tek e ndalo no ne ni malo. Lal no okel gi wuoro.  Joke mwandu moko ne omi thuolo mar kelo mwandu gi to kuom mano ne gi dhi nyime uso mwandu gigo ne chumbu moko eka bange Kemsa ochako onyiewo mwandugo kuom jochumbu go,"" nomedo."
More than half of youth in Kenya are waiting to see how the Covid-19 vaccine affects those who have already received it before they can take the jab, according to a new report.	Mokalo nus mar rawere ma Kenya pod rito neno kaka chanjo mane omi jok motelo terogi kapok gi ng'ado mar kawo chuopo ma kamano, kaluwore gi duoko mar nonro manyien.
The study, by Amref Health Africa, has attributed the wait-and-see attitude among 52 per cent of the young people to fears of the likely effects the jab may have on their health.	Nonro, motim gi Amref Health Afrika, ose teno chuny mar rit-ine man kuom ata malo 52 e wi mia mar rawere go gi luoro mag chandruok ma nyalo chanjo no nyalo kelo e ngima gi.
More than half of female youth respondents, or 60.85 per cent, said they are waiting to see how those who have been injected react before making the decision of whether or not they will take the vaccine.	Mokalo nus mar joma wakeyni ma ne ochiwore e nonro no , kata ata malo 68.85 e wi mia, nowacho ni girito neno kaka joma ne ochwo motelo bedo kapok gi ngado ka bende gibiro dhi e chanjo no kata ooyo.
On the other hand, 47.38 of males told researchers in the study whose findings were released last week that they would be willing to take the vaccine.	Komachielo, 47.38 mag joma chuo ne onyiso jo tim nonro e nonro ma duoko mage ne ogol e juma mokalo ni ne ginyalo yie kawo chanjo no.
The study, titled The Determinants of COVID-19 Vaccine Behaviour Intentions Among The Youth In Kenya: A Vaccine Pre-Introduction Study, noted many young people are hesitant to take the vaccine despite the fact that they are major influencers.	Nonro ma thor mare ne en, Ranyisi mag yie chanjo mar Covid -19 kaluwore gi timbe kod paro e kind rawere e Kenya: Nonro kapok orwaki chanjo, ne fulo ni rawere ne ok oikore dhi kawo chanjo kata obedo ni bgin eme ne gin thuolo mamalo mar lomboe ji kamano.
But the study also points out that a good number of youths understand the importance of the vaccine.	To nonro no bende siemo ni rawere mathoth ne ongeyo ber mar chanjo go.
“Of those who are not ready to be vaccinated, 52 per cent say they are waiting to see the effects of the vaccine on those who have received it while six per cent are completely unwilling to receive the vaccine,” states the study.	""" Kuom mago mane ok oikore mondo ochanji, 52 e wi miya wachoni girito neno rach ma chanjo go kelo kuom jok ma osechanji, ka 6 ewi miyato odagi chuth ni gin ok nyal chanjgi,"" kaka nonro lero."
More than half of those sampled, (65 per cent), said they rejected the Covid-19 vaccine due to inadequate information that has been provided so far.	Mokalo nus mar joma nokaw e nonroni, (65e wi miya), ne owacho ni ne gitamore kawo chanjo no kaluwore ni ne pok giyudo ler moromo e wi chanjo go.
They also said they do not have access to enough information on the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine.	Bende ne giwacho ni ok giyud thuolo mar nwang'o ler moromo e wi ber gi rach mag chanjo go.
There was another segment of the young people (seven per cent) that said it rejected the vaccine because it either conflicts with their cultures or religion.	Ne nitie bathe komachielo mar o ganda matindogo (ata malo abiryo e wi mia) ma ne owacho ni gitamore chanjo go kaluwore ni odhi ataro mar kitgi gi timbegi kata yie mar gi.
The scientists established that the youth are afraid of long-term effects of the vaccine on their health, for example, losing some of the functions of their bodies.	Jolony mag Sayans to no fwenyo ni ni rawere oluoro chandruok mar kinde malach ma chanjo go kelo e ngima gi kuom ranyisi bedo ni ginyalo wito teko mag fuonde gi moko mag del.
They also fear adverse reactions such as fever, headaches, migraines, joint pains and absence of menses.	Bende giluoro chandruok maricho kaka koyo gi liet, wich bar, rem mag fuonde mag del, gi koso neno remo mar ria.
Other issues of concern were the possibility of blood clots and infertility, especially in men.	Weche moko mane omako chuny gi gin kaka bedo ni remo nyalo koto, kodobedo ma onge gi teko nyodo ahinya to kuom joma chuo.
The possible change of menstrual cycle among women, which would include missing monthly periods, also came out as a major issue of concern during the study.

“... you're thinking at my age, if this thing can affect me, then how will my tomorrow be? Will I get to a place where I can only have one child? Will I get to a place where I cannot be able to function like I would have if I had not taken the vaccine?” one of the youth told Amref scientists.	"""…iparo ni an kaka pod arom ni, ka gima kamano  otimore na to ere kaka nima na ma kiny nobedi? Abiro chop[o kama anyalo mana yudo nyathi achiel?

No adverse effects have been reported among recipients of the jab since the vaccination programme was launched in Kenya in March to warrant investigations, according to the Ministry of Health.

Common side effects, however, include pain at the injection area, headache, tiredness and muscle aches.	Weche matenge ma ja timore gin mana kaka, rem e kar kama ochuo riwi, wich bar, olo kod rem mar leche.
Those who were prioritised in the vaccination drive were healthcare workers, security officers, teachers and those aged 58 years and above.	Jok mane omi thuolo mokwongo e chanjo no gin kaka jochiw thieth, jo chiw arita kwe, jopuonj to gi jok madongo ma hik gi 58 ka dhi nyime.
The research was conducted, through an online platform, in all the 47 counties among youth aged between 18 and 35.	Nonro ni notim e yor mbuyi, e kaunti 47 duto ma kenya e kind rawewre ma hikgi ni e kind 18-35.
The study was commissioned to assess what determined the behaviour of youth towards the vaccine.	Nonro no ne oor mondo o non gima yiero tim rawere e yiero kawo chanjo.
A total of 665 youth participated in the study with more than half of respondents, (60.30 per cent), being males.	Duto maromo 665 mag rawere ne odonjo e nonro no ka mokalo nus mag joma ne odonjo e nonro no (60.30 e wi miya),ne gin chwo.
Of those who took part, 45.35 per cent were from urban counties while 26.36 per cent and 28.29 per cent were from peri-urban and rural counties respectively.	Kuom jogo ma ne okonyo timo nonro no, 45.35 e wi mia ne wuok ekaunti mani bombe, ka 26.36 e wi mia, kod 28.29 e wi mia to ne wuok e kaunti ma oluoro mag bombe kod e gwenge mag risaf kaluwore kamano.
The youth were found to have relied mainly on information from social media to make the decision on whether or not they would take the jab.	Rawere ne oyud ni otenore mana kuom weche ma giyudo e kuonde tudruok mag mbuyi mag oganda mondo gikonyre go e ngado rieko ka gibiro kawo chanjo kata ooyo.
Others rejected the vaccine because they do not have confidence in the government's response efforts to the pandemic.	Moko ne otamore kawo chanjo no nikech ok gin gi chir kod piny owacho kuom teko kod wuok mar kedo gi chandruog no.
In the study, scientists noted that the common source of information about Covid-19 and vaccines among youth was social media, which accounted for 40.30 per cent of the information consumed about the pandemic.	E nonro no, jo lony mag sayans noyudo ni yo kende mar yudo weche kodure gi Covi-19 gi chanjo e kind rawere en mbuyi mar oganda, ma otingo ata malo 40.30 mag weche ma ji tiyo go e wi chandruog no.
TV and radio also provided young people with information on Covid-19, at 31.43 per cent and 23.91 per cent respectively. Information received by word of mouth stood at a paltry 2.56 per cent.	Nyakalondo mar TV, Redio bende ne miyo rawere weche e wi covid-19, e kwan mar 31.43 e wi miya, kod23.91 ewi miya moro ka moro. Weche ma ikowo gi dhok nochu ekwan matin hinya mar 2.56 e wi mia.
Rural youth, with primary level of education, were found to rely on radio for information on Covid-19.	Rawere ma e gwenge ma jo ni gi somo mar praimar ne ogeno kuom nyakalondo mar redio kuom weche mag Covid-19.
Most of those in colleges and universities relied majorly on social media.	Mago ma ni e Kolej kod mbalariany ne ogeno kuom tudruok mag mbuyi mag oganda.
Whereas the Ministry of Health is regarded as the main source of information on the pandemic, only 1.35 per cent of respondents relied on it.	Kata ka obedo ni migao mar thieth ema ong'e kaka dag weche ma otudore gi chandruoge mag ngima, mana 1.35 e wi mia ne ogene.
“Most young people have access to social media and fast-flowing information compared to older people, thus they may access misinformation and spread it to older people which may lead to vaccine hesitancy,” the study shows.	"""Ngeny rawere ni gi yot yudo weche kokalo e mbuyi mag oganda kod weche maridore mapiyo moloyo joma dongo, omiyo ginyalo yudo weche ma ok ni kare kendo keyo ne joma dongo mapiyo, gino ma nyalo kelo dok chien e kawo chanjo.,"" nonro nyiso kamano."
Meanwhile, a separate study carried out in Mombasa, Trans-Nzoia, Kajiado, and Nairobi counties established that most Community Health Volunteers (81 per cent) would accept the vaccine. 	E kinde no, Nonro moro machielo ma no tim e kaunti mag Mombasa,Trans-Nzoia, Kajiado, gi Nairobi ne yango ni thoth nyamrerwa (81 ewi mia ne nyalo yie gi chanjo.
The study that was meant to explore their knowledge on Covid-19 vaccine, under the title COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy: Vaccination Intentions and Attitudes of Community Health Volunteers in Kenya, the rest of the members of the group said they were hesitant to take the jab over safety concerns.	Nonro ma ne ochan ni mondo onon ngeyo mar gi e wi chenjo mar covid-19: Gima omiyo ichenjo kod paro mar Nyamreche e wi chanjo go e Kenya, moko kuom tieng' no nowacho ni ok gidwar kawo chanjo no kaluwore luoro mar arita gi.
Less than half of the health volunteers, or 36 per cent, and another 10 per cent cited social media and community meetings respectively, as their main sources of information. 	Ma tin ne nus mar Nyamreche go kata 36 e wi mia kod 10 ewi mia no simeo tudruok mag mbuyi gi romo mag gweng kaluwore kamano kaka yore gi mag yudo weche.
West Pokot County has the second-highest fertility rate in Kenya, with an average of seven children per family, way above the two to three for the rest of the country.	Kaunty mar Pokot ma Yimbo, ema ni gi mew mar nyodo ma malo e thuolo mar ariyo e Kenya, gi kwan ma dirom nyindindo a biryo e ot ka ot malo moyombo ariyo kata adek mag kuonde ma moko e pacho ka.
West Pokot’s 7.2 per cent fertility rate has been linked with issues related to family planning as the national average stands at 3.4 per cent as per the 2019 Census.	Kwan mar 7.2 e wi mia mar mew mar nyodo ma West Pokot osetud gi weche mag komo nyuol ka kwan mar piny kenya to ochung e 3.4 e wi miyakaluwore gi kweno mar oganda ma 2019.
It is also in West Pokot that children suffer the highest stunting rate at 46 per cent, according to the 2014 Kenya Demographic Health Survey (KDHS), which also cites that more than one-quarter of children under five years are malnourished.    	En bende mana e gwenge mag pokot ma nyithindo nie gi thirno e okang ma malo e kwan mar 46 e wi mia, kaluwore gi nonro mar kwan oganda mag Kenya Demographic Health Survey (KDHS) ma 2014 ma bende siemo ni mokalo achiel e wi angwen mag nyithindo ma kono ni gi chandruok mag remo chiemo makare moromo.
Be the county has made significant progress in tackling this issues, as family planning uptake has increased from 13 per cent in 2013 to the current 28 per cent, according to Performance Monitoring for Action Data released by the International Centre for Reproductive Health Kenya (ICRHK). 	Bed ni  piny kenya osegoyo okang maduong e tieko wechegi, kaka kawo tiyo gi yore komo nyuol ose medore kowuok e 13 e wi mia e higa 2013 nyaka 28 e wi mia ma sani, kaluwore gi weche mogol gi duol mar nono tije kawo okang, ma ne ogo gi International Centre for Reproductive Health Kenya (ICRHK).
Struggling to make ends meet	Ng'ang'ni mondo inyal yudo gik ma idwaro.
But many women on family planning are doing so in secrecy for fear of repercussions from their husbands, who culturally believe that children are a blessing.	To mon mangeny ma ni e yor komo nyuol  time e yor apanda ka giluoro gik maditimre ne gi ka  ofwenygi gi chuo gi ma ongeyo mana ni nyithindo gi gueth.
Philomena Cherotich, 33, and mother of three from Ngoleyo in West Pokot, has been using modern contraceptives to prevent pregnancy for the last four years, a fact her husband is not aware of.

If he does, she says, he will ban her from using it. 	Ka ofwenyo, owacho, to obiro tame chuth kik otigo.
The family of five is struggling to make ends meet, and is a representative sample of thousands of families across the vast county with more children than they can provide for.

As a result of non-spaced births, the risk of children dying before their first birthday is significantly higher in West Pokot compared to Kiambu or Nyeri according to the KDHS 2014.	Ka luwore gi rem chano nyuol mar nyithindo, nitiere nyalruok ma malo mar nyithindo mathoth wito ngima gi ka pok gitieko hik gi achiel ae nyuol gi ei Pokot kopim gi Kiambu kata Nyeri, mano kaluwore gi KDHS 2014.
While there are other factors that contribute to child mortality, no spacing between births is a major contributor. 	Kata obedo ni nitiere weche mangeny manyalo miyo nyithindo wit ngima gi, rem komo nyuol en en achiel kuom gik madongo ma kamago.
Shorter birth intervals have been demonstrated to be associated with higher mortality, both during and after infancy. 	Nyuol machiegni machiegni ose tud ga gi thoye mag nyithindo e kinde mag nyuol nyaka ekinde ma nyathi yom.
Peter Gichangi, the key investigator for the Performance Monitoring for Action at ICRHK, notes that despite all these hurdles, West Pokot continues to perform impressively well in the uptake of family planning, adding that only 31 percent of pregnancies were unintended in 2020 compared to 39 per cent a year ago.	Peter Gachangi, ja nonro maduong e duol mar  nono tije mag kawo okang(Performance Monitoring for Action) e  ICRHK, neno kata obedo ni nitie obadho mathoth, West Pokot pod dhi nyime timo maber ahinya kuom tiyo gi yore mag komo nyuol, ka omedo ni mana ata malo 31 kende mag iye ema ne ok ochane higa2020 kopim gi ata malo 39 e higa mokalo.
Babies born after the shortest birth intervals, less than two years, are nearly twice as likely to die (83 deaths per 1,000 live births) as babies born after three (42 deaths per 1,000 live births) or four or more years (44 deaths per 1,000 live births)	Nyithindo ma onyuol bang kinde ma chwok bang nyuol machielo, ma tin ne higni ariyo,ni gi thuolo mani malo nyadiriyo  ma tho(thoye 83 kuom monyuol 1000  ma ngima) ka nyithindo monyuol bang higa adek bang nyuol machielo ( thoye 42 kuom nyuol 1000 ma ngima) kata  higni angwen kata mokalo,  (thoye 44 kuom nyuol 1000 ma ngima)
But by 2018, men in West Pokot were vehemently opposed to their wives practicing family planning.	To kata e higa 2018 chuo Pokot mathoth ne kwedo mager ahinya wach monde gi mar komo nyuol.
Wilson Ngaren, the county’s reproductive health coordinator, recalls cases where men went home to check the upper arms of their wives for any signs of an implant, and then proceeded to raise hell if any was found.	Wilson Ngaren,  jatud weche mag yore ngima mag nyuol e kaunti paro kinde ma thoth ma chuo ne dok utgi rango bede mondegi ranyisi moro amora mar yor komo nyuol ma iketo e bat kendo kelo lweny maratipo kane gifwenyo moro amora.
So how did that change?	To mano ne olokore nade?
Valentine Cherop, a community health volunteer under ICRHK in West Pokot, says the county organizes weekly barazas to educate men who then pass the information to their fellow men about the benefits of family planning. 	Valentine Cherop, Nyamrerwa e bwo ICRHK e West Pokot, wacho ni Kaunti jaloso ga buche mag barasa kama imiyoe chuo puonj ma ka gi aye to gidhi gipuonjo chuo wetegi e wi ber mag lomonyuol.

His body was found dangling from a rope tied to an avocado tree near his parents’ homestead.	Ne oyud ringrene koliero e tol motwe e yadh abokado e bath dala jonyuolne.
The 44-year-old reportedly got angry after his immediate family discouraged him against inheriting a widow in the neighbourhood.	Wachore ni dichwo ma jahigni  piero ang'wen gang'wenno iye ne owang' bang' joodgi nyise ni kik oter chi liel moro e gweng'gino.

“Even the new wife rejected her husband’s plans to marry a second wife,” added the administrator.	Jatelono ne omedo ni, “Chiege ma ne eka okendono bende ne otamore wach chwore kendo dhako mar ariyo.”
According to Onyango, Ong’ong’a and the widow had been seeing each other for nearly two years.	Onyango wacho ni Ong’ong’a ne nigi osiep mar kisera gi chi lielno kuom higni ariyo kama.
“His relationship with the widow made his immediate family accuse him of neglecting his late wife, who died in March this year,” said the assistant chief, adding: “The man’s family now feared his continued relationship with the widow might lead to an outcome similar to what befell his first spouse.”	Asistant chifno ne owacho ni, “Joodgi Ong’ong’a ne neno ni osiep ma ne Ong’ong’a nigo gi chi lielno ne omiyo ojwang'o chiege ma ne otho Mach higani.” Kendo ne omedo ni: “Joodgi gi koro ne luor ni osiep mapod nie kindgino biro miyo ojwang' bende chiege ma yande okendoni.”

“Last week, he hit the woman in the head with a plank of wood. The man fled upon suspecting he had killed his wife after she collapsed,” said the administrator.

Ong’ong’a’s spouse received treatment at a Rangwe hospital and was discharged.	Ne othiedh chi Ong’ong’a  e osiptal mar Rangwe kae to odok dala.
A day later, Ong’ong’a was found dead near his parents’ homestead, with suicide attributed to his death.	Odiechieng' achiel bang'e ne oyud Ong’ong’a kotho e bath dala jonyuolne kendo iwacho ni ne odere.

NEB ne ondiko niya; “Wajiwo ji duto mariwowa lwedo ni gine ni ondik nyingegi e rejista mar patiwa mondo gibed jokanyo kapo ni gidwaro chung' gi otiko mar ODM kata gidwaro goyo ombulu ne ODM. Gie sani ng'ato ok chul gimoro amora mondo obed jakanyo mar patiwa.”
In the event a vacancy arises in any of the current grassroots structures, NEB has advised its members to consult with them for guidance and a way forward in regard to filling them.	NEB owacho ni kapo ni kom moro odong' nono e gweng', onego onyisgi mondo gikony jogweng' ng'eyo  gima onego otim mondo giket ng'ato e komno.
“No person or organ may proceed to fill any vacancy before consultations with, and agreement by NEB,” stated NEB.	NEB ne omedo niya; “Ok omi ng'ato ang'ata kata kidieny moro amora rusa mar keto ng'ato e kom kapok giwuoyo gi NEB, kendo oyienegi timo kamano.”
The board has also called on all county offices to prepare for the polls by verifying their membership status, familiarising themselves with elections rules which can be accessed from the party’s website.	Jo bodno bende ne onyiso ofise duto mag kaunti ni giikre ne yiero kuom nono ni jokanyo duto mag pati e kauntigi opwodh maber kendo gine ni gilony gi chike mag yiero mayudore e websait.
The move is a twist from an initial decision by the party to push the grassroots elections to 2022.	Ma en lokruok ma patino otimo, ne gikwongo giwacho ni gibiro chwalo yiero mar gweng' nyaka higa mar 2022.
In May, ODM deputy party leader and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said conducting party elections a year before the general election would be ill-advised.	E dwe mar Mei, Wycliffe Oparanya, ma en jalup jatelo mar ODM kendo Gavana ma Kakamega ne owacho ni  ok ber timo yiero mar pati higa achiel motelo ne yiero maduong'.
The elections were also initially scheduled for April 2021 but that too was aborted.	Ne ochan ni ibiro tim yierogo April 2021, to mano bende ne ok otimore.
The NEB has also said although the term of party holders has expired, the officials will be expected, “to hold over until new officials are elected in line with the Political Parties Act, ODM constitution and party rules.”	 Bende, NEB ne owacho ni kata obedo ni kinde mag bet e kom mag jogo osekalo, gigeno ni opisago “biro dhi nyime gi migepegi nyaka chop kama oyier jomoko mondo okaw kargi kaluwore gi Chik Matayo Pati mag Siasa kata Political Parties Act, chik mar ODM kod chike mamoko mag patino.”
“As they hold over they have the full mandates and authority of their offices and will continue carrying out their tasks as officeholders,” read a statement by NEB.	NEB ne ondiko stetment niya; “Sama pod gin e migepegigo gin gi ratiro duto mag telo ma ne omigi kendo gibiro dhi nyime timo migepegi kaka pile.”
Members from counties have been asked to commence their own consultations, “to reach consensus on whom they should front as officials at all levels when NEB calls for the elections.”	Onyis jokanyo mag kaunti ni giwuo e kindgi “mondo giwinjre ni gin ng'ano gini mabiro laro kombe mag  kidienje mopogore opogore sama NEB biro lando yiero.”
The Communication Authority of Kenya (CA) is set to review the rate at which mobile phone companies charge to connect calls (interconnection or termination rates) in a move that could spark another price war in the country’s telecommunications sector.	Riwruok mar Communication Authority of Kenya (CA) dwaro nono nengo ma kembe simu mag lwedo oketo (bed ni en nengo mar gocho ne ja lain  mopogore kata interconnection rates, kata mana nengo mar gocho ne ja lain machal gi mari kata termination rates). To mano en okang' manyalo kelo ywaruok mar nengo goyo simu gi kembe simu mag Kenya.
The regulator said in a notice the review, coming after 10 years, will be conducted by comparing and contrasting the cost of voice calls in Kenya and similar economies.	Nonro mogik mar nengo goyo simu ne otim higni 10 mokalo, rwruokno wacho ni wang'ni gidwaro pimo nengo goyo simu e piny Kenya gi nengo goyo simu e pinje mamoko machalo gi Kenya.
“On July 8, 2011, the authority issued Addendum No 2 to the Determination No 2 of 2010, revising the mobile and fixed termination rates, implying that implementation would run till June 30, 2015,” noted CA.	"CA ne owacho ni; “Julai tarik 8, 2011, riwruokno ne omedo wach moro e winjruok ma ne oyudo gisetimo,  Addendum No 2.

“Upon expiry of the glide path in 2015, the authority took a decision to observe the market and see how it reacts before proceeding to undertake another costing study.”	“Winjruokno ne  dhi nono  dongruok ma ne dhi bedoe e kindeno. Kane orumo e higa mar 2015, riwruokno ne ong'ado mar ng'iyo mokwongo kaka ohala ne dhi bedo kapok gichako nono kendo kaka inyalo tim lokruok e nengo.”
Mobile termination rates are a key cost component for pricing calls among service providers. 	Nengo ma CA oketo mar goyo simu en gima duong' ma kembe mag simu nono sama  ging'ado nengo ma gibiro keto ne goyo simu.
It determines the margins that operators can put on voice calls within and outside their networks. 	Nengono nyiso nengo ma kembe nyalo keto bed ni en simu migoyo e laindgi kata ne lainde mamoko.
In 2010, the CA cut mobile termination rates by more than 50 per cent, from Sh2.21 in July 2010 to Sh0.99 by July 2013.	E higa mar  2010, CA ne odwoko chien nengo goyo simu gi gimoro atamalo 50, ne giwuok e siling 2.21 e Julai, 2010 mi gitere siling 0.99 Julai 2013.
The move kicked off a price war between Safaricom and Airtel that saw voice call costs fall from a high of Sh12 per minute to an average of Sh3 per minute.	Wachno ne okelo ywaruok  mar nengo e kind  Safaricom  gi  Airtel, nengo gocho ne owuok siling 12 e dakika mochopo siling 3 e dakika.
“Owing to the passage of time, changes in the markets as well as the macroeconomic environment, the authority now wishes to carry out a review of the telecommunications interconnection rates bench-marking methodology,” stated CA.	CA wacho ni, “Nikech kinde koro osekalo, kendo lokruok mang'eny osetimore e weche mag ohala, gidwaro nono kendo yo migoyogo nengo mag simu migoyo e lainde mopogore.”
The latest review comes even as service providers continue to record a slowed growth on voice compared to other revenue streams like data and mobile money.	Idwa timo nonroni kata obedo ni kembe mag simu wacho ni ohala mar simu migoyo dhi mos kopim gi ohala mar ng'iewo intanet mar simu kata ooro pesa e yor simu.
According to Safaricom’s latest annual report, the telco registered Sh94.4 billion in voice revenue last year, a marginal drop from Sh95.7 billion in 2019 and Sh95.6 billion in 2018. 	Kaluwore gi ripot mogik mar higa ka higa mar Safaricom, ne giyudo bilion 94.4 kuom simu migoyo, ne gi dok chien matin nikech e higa mar 2019 ne giyudo siling  95.7 to e higa mar 2018 ne giyudo siling' 95.6.

The convoy of cars snaked its way from Iten County Referral Hospital mortuary in the early morning chill, down Iten-Kabarnet road, weaving its way around the Kerio escarpment.	Gokinyi ka piny podi ng'ich, mtokni modhuro ne oriedo mos ka giwuok e mochari ma  Iten County Referral Hospital ka gilor e ndara mar Iten-Kabarnet kendo gichomo hoho mar Kerio.
A hearse with a banner emblazoned with the photo of policewoman Caroline Kangogo led the fleet of about 40 cars, decked in white and purple ribbons. Accompanying the cars were dozens of boda boda riders.	Ne obaw picha maduong' mar polis ma dhako Caroline Kangogo e mtoka ma ne oting'o ringrene. Mtokano ne otelo ne chiegni mtokni 40 mane odusi gi tonde ma rochere kod ma rajamna, boda boda mang'eny bende ne ringo kodgi.
Along the road, curious residents craned their necks to catch a glimpse of what seemed like a bridal procession.	Sama ne mtoknigo kalo jogweng' ne biro e ndara mondo gigo wang'gi e  gima ne chalonegi mtokni mag arus.
It was, perhaps a way of honouring some of Kangogo’s wishes that included having her body dressed in a bridal gown.	Nyalo bedo ni joma ne ochano wechego ne temo timo kaka Kangongo ne okwayo, ne owacho ni doher mondo orwakne law arus ka otho.
Kangogo, 34, whom many in Nyawa village, Elgeyo Marakwet County, knew as a humble and disciplined officer, was finally coming back home. 	Kangogo ma ne en jahigni 34, ne koro dok dala, ji mang'eny e gweng' mar Nyawa, e Kaunti mar Elgeyo Marakwet, ne ong'eye kaka polis mobolore kendo modimbore.
The weather, chilly, cloudy, with little bursts of sunshine, was exactly as it was on the day Kangogo’s body was discovered in a bathroom at her parents’ home.	Piny ne ng'ich kendo boche ne ng'eny e polo, chieng' ne lidhore mana matin kendo chako lal, kamano e kaka kor yamo ne chalo chieng' ma ne oyud ringre Kangogo e baf mar od jonyuolne.
That was 11 days after John Ogweno, a police constable, was found dead in his car at Kasarani police line in Nakuru.	Mano ne otimore ndalo 11 bang' yudo ringre John Ogweno e mtokane  Kasarani police, Nakuru. Ogweno ne en polis constable.
Kangogo was linked to his shooting.	Wachore ni Kangogo ema ne ogoye  bunde.
A few days later, Peter Ndwiga, a businessman, was also found dead in a lodging in Juja.	Ndalo matin bang'e ne oyud  Peter Ndwiga, ja ohala moro ka bende otho e lojing' moro Juja.
His shooting, too, was linked to the policewoman.	Wachore bende ni polis ma dhakoni ema ne onege.
Kangogo would later be found dead, taking with her anything she may have known about the killings to the grave.	Ne oyud Kangogo bang'e kosetho. Odhi e bur gi weche duto ma dibed ni ong'eyo e wi nekgo.
Police thereafter announced they had launched a manhunt for Kangogo, who they said was a key suspect in the murders.	Bang' mano polis nolando ni gisechako manyo Kangogo, kendo ni gibiro manye ka sindan.
An iron gate painted blue was the final stop for the convoy after a 30-minute drive to Kangogo’s parents’ home where she would be laid to rest.	Mtoknigo ne ochopo e ranga jonyuol  Kangogo, ne en rangach ma mbulu. Ne idhi iik Kangogo e dalagino.
Then the programme began, with speaker after speaker eulogising the woman they commonly knew as ‘Caroline Jemutai’.	Kae to program mar iik ne ochakore, ng'ato ka ng'ato ma ne wuoyo, ne puoyo miyono ma ne ong'ere kaka ‘Caroline Jemutai’.
Yesterday, hundreds of residents and a section of leaders attended her burial ceremony conducted within the same compound where her lifeless body was discovered in the morning of July 16.	Nyoro, jogweng' miche kod jotelo moko ne odhi e iikne. Ne oike e dala ma ne oyudie ringrene e okinyi mar tarik 16, Julai.
Kangogo was buried in a white gown as she had requested in a draft message found in her phone that she is believed to have authored before her death.	Ne orwak ne Kangogo law arus. Ne okwayo kamano e mesej moro ma ne ondiko e simbe ma wachore ni ne ondiko kapok otho.
According to the message, she had also asked to be cremated – a wish that her family did not honour, and instead buried her at her father Barnaba Kangogo’s farm.	E mesejno ne okwayo bende ni owang' ringrene. Wuon-gi ne otamore timo kamano, kar mano ne oike e dala wuon-gi. Wuon-gi nyinge en  Barnaba Kangogo.
There was no usual gun salute as is the tradition in the send-off of police officers who die while on duty.	Ne ok ogo bunde e liende kaka jatimore ka iiko polis motho ka pod nie tich.
Police officers from Nakuru where Kangogo worked and others who came to bid her farewell were dressed in civilian attire and sat inside a tent reserved for leaders.	Polise ma Nakuru kama Kangogo ne tiyoe ne obiro ike ka girwako lep raia, kendo ne gibet e hema ma ne owal ne jotelo.
They would later lay a wreath on her grave.	Bang'e ne giketo maua e liende.
No uniformed officer from the nearby Iten or Tambach police stations showed up to maintain order at the ceremony where a large crowd of villagers gathered.	Onge kata mana polis achiel ma Iten kata Tambach  morwako yunifom ma ne obiro mondo orit  kuwe kata obedo ni jogweng' mangeny ne ochokore kanyo
Kangogo’s husband Richard Ngeno sat pensively with their two children next to his parents-in-law.	Chwor Kangogo, Richard Ngeno ne obet gi nyithindgi ariyo e bath ore gi mare, kendo pache ne ni mabor.
Ngeno, a Mombasa-based police commissioner, as well as Kangogo’s parents, did not speak at the funeral.	Ngeno, ma en polis komisona ma Mombasa, kaachiel gi jonyuol Kangogo ne ok owacho kata mana wach achiel.
At 2.27pm, Kangogo’s body was lowered to the grave.	Saa 8.27 modiechieng' ne oket ringre Kangogo e bur.
“Many things have been written and said about my sister. The Caroline you read and heard about is not the one we know. She was a humble girl and we were happy whenever she was around,” her brother Mark told mourners.	Owadgi Mark ne owacho ne joma ne obiro e liel niya; “Ji osewacho kendo osendiko gik mang'eny e wi nyaminwa. Kata kamano, Caroline ma uwinjo ka ji woyoe kata ma ji ndiko weche kuome, ok e Caroline ma wang'eyo. Caroline ne en nyako mobolore kendo ne wamor kinde moro amora ma ne en kodwa.”
If my sister did anything wrong, then it was by mistake.	Kapo ni nyaminwani ne otimo gimoro marach, ne obothne.
It has not been confirmed by the DCI whether she killed anyone or not.	DCI pok onyisowa gadier kabe ne onego ng'ato kata ooyo.
He said his sister was religious and often went to the nearby St Joseph’s Catholic Church, Anin, for prayers.	Ne owacho ni nyamin-gi  ne ohero weche din kendo ne ojadhi lemo e kanisa man machiegni kanyo mar St Joseph’s Catholic Church, Anin.
Kangogo’s uncle Robert Kipkorir, who was the family’s spokesman, said until yesterday, the family was yet to know whether Kangogo committed suicide or she was murdered.	Nera mar Kangogo, ma ne wuoyo e lo joodgi ne owacho ni nyaka chop nyoro, jodala ne podi ok  ong'eyo gadier ka Kangogo ne odere kata ne onege.
“It is only God and Caroline who know what caused her death,” Kipkorir said.	"Kipkorir ne owacho niya; “En mana Nyasaye gi Caroline ema ong'eyo gima ne onege."""
On various occasions, the latest being July 21, 2021, President Uhuru Kenyatta has vowed that Kenya will not cede even an inch of its territory to anyone.	Ker Uhuru Kenyatta osegabedo ka wacho kinde ka kinde ni Kenya ok bi chwalo tong' mare kata mana inji achiel ne piny moro amora. Machiegni moloyo, ne owacho kamano  Julai, tarik 21 2021.
The president, who was addressing security personnel training in Boni Forest, Lamu County, was most likely referring to the Kenya-Somalia maritime dispute.	Ker ne owacho kamano, kane owuoyo gi joma tiego jorit kuwe Boni Forest, Kaunti ma Lamu. Nenore ni ne owuoyo e wi ywaruok mosegabedo e kind Kenya gi Somalia e wi tong' mar Pige Nam Chumbi.
Sadly, the determination to protect our territory seems to be taken with the seriousness its deserves only in the case of Somalia.	Gima lit en ni, wach rito tong' mar pinywa imiyo pek madwarore mana sama iywaruok gi  Somalia.
Kenya and Uganda have been wrangling for years over their common boundary in Lake Victoria, including the location of islands such as Migingo and Mageta.	Kenya gi Uganda osebedo ka yware kuom higni e wi tong' mar pige Nam Viktoria, moriwo chulni kaka mag Migingo kod Mageta.
And although these islands have for decades been inhabited by Kenyans, Uganda seems to have the upper hand on them.	Kata obedo ni jo Kenya osedak e chulnigo kuom higni pieche, jo Uganda timore ka gima ginie weg chulnigo.
It is common for Ugandan security officers to raid the islands and the waters around them and arrest Kenyan fishermen on flimsy grounds, only to set them free after they part with hefty bribes.	Kinde mang'eny polise ma Uganda biroga e chulnigo kendo gimako jolupo gi weche moko matindo tindo kae to gigonyogi ka gisechulogi asoya mang'eny.
Some of the Kenyans are held for days in dingy cells on the Ugandan side. 	Moko kuom jo Kenya iketo e sel maricho richo mag Uganda man loka machielo kuom ndalo mogwaro.
In Mageta, Ugandan authorities reportedly force Kenyans to pay Sh8,000 per month for every fishing boat.	Wachore ni e chula ma Mageta, jo Uganda chuno jo Kenya mondo ochul pes Kenya siling' 8,000  dwe ka dwe, ne moro kamoro kuom yie mag lupo.
Yet, such gross mistreatment and exploitation of Kenyans doesn't seem to bother our government.	To kata obedo ni itimo ne jo Kenya marach kamano, kendo isandogi e yo ma kamano, sirkal ok odewo.
Granted, Kenya and Uganda are friendly nations. We cherish the friendship. 	En adier ni Kenya kod Uganda gin osiepe. Kendo wageno osiep manie kindgino.
But friendship is only genuine where there is mutual respect. 	Kata kamano, ka osiep en madier, nyaka luor bedie e kindgi.
That clearly is not the case here.	Nenore ayanga ni onge luor ma kamano e wachni.
It's a shame for the government to do nothing while its citizens are abused and extorted.	En wichkuot ni sirkal ok tim gimoro amora sama isando raia kendo imayogi pesgi.
Kenya must draw the line. 	Kenya nyaka chung' motegno.
While we do not advocate for Kenya to take up arms against our neighbours, the government must demand that Ugandan officers keep off Kenyan fishermen. 	Kata obedo ni ok wadwar ni Kenya ochak lweny kod jirendene, wadwaro ni sirkal one ni polise ma Uganda owere gi jolupo ma Kenya.
It should also call for the resumption of the stalled Lake Victoria demarcation exercise. 	Onego gi chak kendo chenro mar keto tong' ne pige mag Nam Viktoria.
Ugandans must not be allowed to turn Kenyans into punching bags.	Ok onego owene jo Uganda thuolo mar timore gi jo Kenya ka gima gin mana gik tugo.
The Director of Criminal Investigations (DCI) George Kinoti has alleged that detectives recovered Sh5.7 million from a woman who they claim was to deliver the cash to judges.	George Kinoti ma en  Director of Criminal Investigations  (DCI) ne owacho ni polise ma jonon wach ne oyudo miyo moro milion 5.7 ma ne otero ne jong'ad bura.
In a replying affidavit sworn by Chief Inspector Felix Karisa to a suit filed by the judges’ association, the DCI claimed detectives raided Justices Aggrey Muchelule and Said Chitembwe’s chambers after a tip-off that they were about to receive Sh7 million bribe. 	E afidavit moro ma Felix Karisa ma en Chief Inspector osingorego kodwoko riwruok mar jong'ad bura, DCI ne owacho ni polise ne odhi mako jong'ad bura Aggrey Muchelule kod Said Chitembwe e ofisegi bang' ng'ato kwalonegi wach ni jong'ad burago idhi mi asoya mar milion 7.
“From the onset, we want to put the record straight that the judges were not arrested or harassed as they claim, but they willingly agreed to accompany us to the DCI headquarters to record their statements over the bribery claims,” swore Karisa.	"Karisa ne osingore niya; “Wadwaro chako gi keto weche maler ni, ne ok omak jong'ad burago bende ne ok ochandgi kaka giwacho, to ne giyie giwegi mondo gidhi kodwa e ofis maduong' mar DCI mondo gindik stetment e wach asoya mawachore ni ne gikawo."""
Karisa said he had been tasked to investigate complaints on some judges and judicial officers accused of graft and had received credible information that some people acting as brokers had approached the judges to procure favourable decisions in some matters.	Karisa ne owacho ni ne omiye ting' mar nono ywak moro, ni jong'ad bura gi opisa mamoko matiyo e doho ne odonjo e timbe mag mibadhi kendo ne oyudo weche madier ni nitie joma oor mondo owuo gi jong'ad burago mondo kes odog konchiel.
He swore that on July 21 he received information from a complainant that a series of meetings between a certain judge and broker had taken place and they agreed on a Sh7 million bribe to be delivered to the judge’s residence.	Ne osingore ni Julai tarik, 21 ne oyudo ywak moro ni jang'ad bura moro kod ng'at ma ne oor ire osebedo ka romo kuom kinde, kendo giseyie ni ibiro ter milion 7 e od jang'ad burano.
However, Karisa swore that the meeting venue was abruptly changed to Milimani High Court, where the broker was to deliver the money. 	Kata kamano, Karisa ne owacho ni ne giloko kar romo apoya mondo obed Milimani High Court, kendo ne onego oter pesa kuno.
He stated that on July 22, they laid a trap at Milimani High Court and waited until around 2pm when they received information that the meeting with the broker was to take place at Justice Muchelule’s chamber while being facilitated by Justice Chitembwe. “	Ne owacho ni Julai, tarik  22, ne giketo obadho Milimani High Court mi girito nyaka gimoro 8:00 modiechieng' kendo ne giyudo wach ni romono ne dhi bedo e ofis mar Jang'ad bura Muchelule  kendo ni Jang'ad bura Chitembwe ne dhi konyo e wechego.
We proceeded to the two judges chambers and introduced ourselves after which we conducted a search on the occupants, which resulted to the seizure of USD50,000 (Sh5 million) from a woman who was present at Justice Muchelule’s chamber,” swore Karisa.	"Karisa ne osingore niya; ""Ne wadhi e ofise jong'ad bura ariyogo kae to wafwenyorenegi kendo wagoyo joma ne nikuno peksen. Ne wayudo miyo ma ne ni kanyo gi dola 50,000 mag Amerka kata siling milion 5.”"
According to the investigator, they recovered another USD7,000 (Sh700,000) from Justice Chitembwe.	Kaluwore gi janon wachno, ne giyudo Jang'ad bura Chitembwe gi dola 7000 mag Amerka kata siling 700,000.
He accused the Kenya Magistrates and Judges Association (KMJA) of misleading the court to stop DCI from arresting or charging the two judges.	Ne owacho ni riwruok mar Kenya Magistrates and Judges Association (KMJA) ne owuondo doho mondo gigol chik ni DCI kik mak kata donj ne jong'ad bura ariyogo.
“The DCI was only undertaking lawful investigations into grave allegations related to corruption and cannot be interpreted to mean an encroachment on the independence of the Judiciary. The petition to shield the judges is an attempt to stifle and frustrate our work,” swore Karisa.	Karisa ne osingore niya: “DCI ne luwo chik kendo ne nono ketho maduong' motudore gi mibadhi. Omiyo ok nyal wach ni ne gidonjore gi Judiciary. Kwayo mar geng'o ni kik mak kata donjne jong'ad burago en yo mar geng'onwa mondo kik wati tijwa kaka dwarore.”
On claims that the DCI did not obtain a search warrant to raid the judges’ chambers, the investigator stated that it was impractical to obtain the search warrants from a court since they had a short notice from the time they got information that the bribery was going to take place. 	DCI wacho ni wach mar ni ne ok oyudo barua mar doho ma ne oyiene mondo odhi omak jogo en wach ma ok nyal chung', nimar ne onge seche mag timo kamano,  ne onyisgi molewo wach asoyano kendo ne gin mana gi kinde matin mar dhi mako jogo.
The two judges were summoned last week but Justice Muchelule and KMJA filed a petition and obtained orders stopping the DCI from summoning, arresting or prosecuting them over the bribery allegations.	Ne oluong jong'ad bura ariyogo e doho juma mokalo, kata kamano, Jang'ad Bura Muchelule kod KMJA ne okwayo ni otam DCI mondo kik oluonggi e doho, kik omakgi kata kik odonjnegi gi wach mar asoyano, mi doho  neo otimo kamano.
KMJA, through lawyer Danstan Omari, argued that the DCI officers illegally stormed Muchelule and Chitembwe’s chambers without any search warrants and did not recover any bribe money as alleged. 	KMJA, katiyo gi okil Danstan Omari, ne owacho ni opisa mag DCI ne oketho chik kuom mwomruok kendo donjo e ofise mag Muchelule kod Chitembwe ma ok omigi barua mar doho kendo ne ok giyudo pesa mag asoya kaka giwachono.
Muchelule swore that the search by DCI officers did not yield anything after which the officers arrested and him took him to DCI headquarters and interrogated him.	Muchelule ne okuong'ore ni onge gima ne opisa mag DCI oyudo e ofise, ni ne gimake amaka kae to gitere e ofis maduong' mar DCI kendo  gipenje penjo.
When the matter came up before Justice James Makau, he extended the orders stopping the judges’ arrests and directed the other parties to file responses before October 18.	Kane wachno ochopo e nyim Jang'ad Bura James Makau, ne omedo chwalo kesno nyime kowacho ni kik mak jong'ad burago, kendo ne owacho ne joma odonjonegigo mondo giter wechegi e doho kapok tarik 18 Oktoba ochopo.

“The disregard for the life of environmental activists in Kenya seems to be the current norm and we wonder for how long the community will continue to be subjected to acts of violence, intimidation, police brutality, enforced disappearance and judicial harassment with no counter action from the State,” she said.

Ahead of Fridays decision, today’s judgement yet again opens the gruesome pages of the heinous murder of the primary school girl who died by the bullet in the dead of the night allegedly triggered by the officers as they searched for a murder suspect said to be a kin of the family.

This strategy will help us to correctly determine all the areas which are prone to the disease.	Yo ma sani waluwoni biro konyowa ng'eyo kuonde ma tuo ni yudore e pinywa ka.
Leishmaniasis classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) is a parasitic disease that is found in parts of the tropics, caused by infection with Leishmania parasites, which are spread by the bite of a phlebotomine sandfly.

The disease comes in two forms, visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) and cutaneous leishmaniasis.	Tuoni biro e yore ariyo ma Kisungu luongo ni visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) kod cutaneous leishmaniasis.
In 2014, it was decided by the world health assembly that countries establish programs to eliminate neglected tropical diseases.

According to Dr Joyce Onsongo, a representative from the World Health Organization, leishmaniasis is given priority in WHO policies, strategies and roadmaps.	Kaluwore gi wach Dr Joyce Onsongo, ma ochung' ne World Health Organization, leishmaniasis WHO oketo nyime e chenro mar gi.
"“Our target is that by 2025 we should be able to control morbidity by 75 per cent and 85 per cent in 2030 in the 13 endemic countries in Africa."" She said. ""We have partnerships in Kenya to enable us to achieve this and we will continue working with national and county governments."""	"“Wadwaro ni ka ochop 2025 owinjore ni wanyalo doko tuoche man e piny gi kwan maromo 75 ewi mia kendo 85 e higa mar 2030 e pinje 13 ma tuoche ngenyie e Africa."" Ne owacho kamano. ""Wan gi joma watiyo go e Kenya ma biro miyowa chopo gol ni kendo wabiro dhi nyime gi tiyo kod sirikal ma piny kod mamalo e loso yorego."""
Onsongo further appealed to all stakeholders to use the strategy as a tool to negotiate, advocate and monitor the elimination of leishmaniasis in order to achieve Universal Health Care.

“Over the last decade, efforts have been undertaken to prevent, control and eliminate the disease.

If you think being a workaholic is a badge of honour, think again. 	Ka ng'ato paro ni tich matek kelo pak to par diriyo.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that long working hours threatens life expectancy, risks strokes and heart-related diseases.

Let your bossy boss know that data from WHO and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) revealed that long working hours (more than 55 a week) led to 745,000 deaths from stroke and ischemic disease in 2016, a 29 per cent increase from 2000.	Omiyo ber ka jatend ni iongeyo ni nonro mar WHO kod riwruok mar jotich e piny mangima - International Labour Organisation (ILO) ne oyango ni tiyo mar seche mageny ma ohingo seche 55 e juma ne okelo dhoo mar dhano maromo 745,000 kuom tuo mar kul bat kata stroke kod tuo mar ischemic  e higa mar ma ne en bedruok  mar kwan dhano 29 e wi mia achiel mane obedo e higa 2000.
In its study, WHO concluded that working for 55 hours and more per week is associated with an estimated 35 per cent higher risk of stroke, and 17 per cent of dying from ischemic heart diseases, as compared to working between 35 and 40 hours a week.	E nonro margi, WHO ne ong'ado ni tiyo kuom seche ma oloyo seche 55 e juma achiel ema kelo 35 re wi mia mar tuo stroke kendo ji maromo 17  e wi mia bende thoo gi tuo mar adundo ka ipimo gi joma tiyo mar seche manyalo romo kind seche 35 kata 40 e juma.
Ischemic heart diseases are a result of an inadequate supply of oxygen and blood to heart muscles.	Tuoche mag adundo biro nikech nok mar muya ma iyweyo kod remo e leche mag adundo dhano.
Despite the increased number of health complications and deaths, more people are working longer hours globally and “this trend puts even more people at risk of work-related disability and early death,” cautions WHO, adding that the burden of work-related diseases is higher in men who account for 72 per cent of the deaths.	Kata obedo ni nitie bedruok mar tuoche kod thoo mangeny e piny, nenro wacho ni ji mangeny tiyo kuom seche mangeny e piny mangima kendo ngima machalo ka ma miyo ji mangeny nyalo yudo ngol kendo nyalo miyo gi dho chon ka pod gitedno” .

WHO established that the Covid-19 pandemic saw many employees working longer than usual and that “teleworking has become the norm in many industries, often blurring the boundaries between home and work” besides massive layoffs seeing the few remaining working longer.

Aman reports to work carrying a laptop bag, but no lunchbox inside. 	Aman dhi ga tich ka oting'o bag mar computa matin mar Laptop  to onge mifuko ma okete chiemo ma ichamo sa odiechieng'.
Lunchtime will see him trooping to a restaurant or the office cafeteria.	E seche ma ichamo chiemo mar odiechieng ' to inene ka odhi kar chiemo oko kata kama jotich chieme.

Why is it not logical for men to carry lunchboxes considering the prevailing harsh economic times yet it is healthier and cheaper?	Ang'o momiyo chuo ok ne ber mar ting'o mifuko mar lunch kaluwore ni ngima sani tek kendo ka wangiyo ni en chiemo maber kendo ma ok okaw pesa mang'eny?
Joseph Waithuki, a credit risk manager, says a lunchbox is impractical and cumbersome for a bachelor who doesn’t cook often and uses public transport due to that small matter of spilling the food and the attendant stress that causes.	Joseph Waithuki, jatelo ma miyo ji hola, wacho ni tingo chiemo ka ngato dhi tich ok en gima yot ahinya kuom ngat no ma pok onyombo ma ok ted ode pile kendo ma hidho matatu ka dhi tich nikech chiemo nyalo pukorene kendo paro ma tich ma kamano nyalo miyo ngato.
But the pandemic forced many to work from home, changing perceptions. “I would spend around Sh300 each day, a cost which can be avoided,” says Waithuki, adding lunchboxes are easier for those who drive as the cars accord them privacy and comfort.	Kata kamano, tuo mar Corona ochuno ji mangeny mar tiyo e udi ma sani loko pach ji kuom tich macahalo kamano.  “Ne atiyo gi shilling 300 pile , pesa mane ok owinjore oti,” Waithuki wacho kamano, ka omedo wacho ni tingo mifuko mar chamo chiemb saa auchiel nyalo bet mayot ne jogo ma dhi tich gi mitokni gi ma obet mos ma onge gima chando gi.
Henry Mwenda, a client delivery manager at a bank, says carrying packed lunch for him was during the early days of the pandemic when eateries were limited and fear of infection was high, but “I would otherwise never carry packed lunch,” he says, arguing it would interfere with his lifestyle. “Imagine going to the club with a lunchbox - it is such a no-no!” says Mwenda.	"Henry Mwenda, jago ma ochungne weche mag jongiewo e bank, wacho ni dhi gi chiemo ma ose tedi  e tich ne otimo diere ma tuo mar corona odonjo e piny sama ne otende mageny mag chiemo ne olor kendo ji ne oluoro yudo tuo mar korona no. ka ok mano,di ne ok atingo chiemo ka adhigo tich,” ne owacho kamano , ka otemo lero ni tingo chiemo no biro ketho ne kaka odwaro ni odagi. “Par ane kaka ngato nyalo dhi kar madho kuong' gi box mar chiemo - mano gima ok nyal timore.""

But carrying lunchboxes was normal for Kenyans who lived abroad.	Katakamano, tingo bocx mar lunch ne en gima yot the jo Kenya ma odak e pinje ma oko.
“In the States, offices have what they refer to as brown bag meeting rooms, also called lunch and learning lessons rooms, where colleagues enjoy their packed lunch as they engage in informal discussions at lunchtime,” says Andrew.*	“E piny jo America, ofise nigi kuonde ma giluongo ni kar romo mar jogo man gi Brown Bags, ma samoro bende iluongo ni kar chamo lunch kod somo.

She includes vegetables, starch, fruit and a healthy beverage. 	Oketo ne chuore alot, chiemo makelo teko, olemo ma ichamo kendo gima imadho.
Eating homemade lunches has great benefits as such meals are healthier, safer, cheaper and balanced giving one “control of the food chain” including storage, says Faith Kariuki, a nutritionist at Afya Bora Nutrition and Wellness Centre. 	Chamo chiemo ma olos e ot kata dala nigi gik mabeyo ma okelo e del; onge gik maricho mageny ma oriwe go; ok okaw pesa mageny kendo otingo gik ma opogore ma miyo ngima dhano bedo maber ka luwore gi kaka okane” Faith Kariuki ma somo kaka ji onego chiemo ma tiyo kama iluongo ni Afya Bora Nutrition and Wellness Centre wacho kamano.
Though he was reluctant at first, he now rarely complains of stomach upset.	Kata obedo ni ndalo ma okuongo ne ok ihikore mar tingo chiemo ka oa go ot, tinde ok oja wacho ni iye ok ber kata ni muore.
She adds that city restaurants have limited choices. “If you want traditional vegetables with brown ugali, you either wouldn’t find it offered, or it would only be available for a limited amount of time.” 	Omedo wacho ni hotele man Nairobi onge gik mangeny ma ngato nyalo yiero mar chamo. “Ka idwaro a lot ma oa e ngweng' kod kuon ma rabuor mondo icham, ok ibi yudo ka otede; ka ok kamano, to ibiro yudo ni itede mana mar kinde matin” .
Besides, restaurants tend to overcook vegetables, whose vitamins and minerals are destroyed by light and heat, but with “a packed lunch you also have control over your choices of fats and oils. 	Ka iweyo mano, otende temo tedo a lot ma okadhore, ma gik ma kelo ber e del ma ose kedhi gi ler kod liet. To ka itingo lunch ma otedi e ot, inyalo yiero kit chiemo ma idwaro chamo.
Vegetable oils are much healthier than most fats used in hotel cooking.	Mo ma yudore e a lot ber gi del moloyo chiemo ma itedo e hotel.
Raphael Tuju was appointed Minister for Information and Tourism in the first Cabinet of former President Mwai Kibaki in 2003.

His assistant at the ministry was Beth Mugo.	Jalupne e migawo no ne en Beth Mugo.
Tuju, a renowned journalist, was no doubt a good fit for the role.	Tuju, ma osomo weche mag fwambo gi keyo ne ngama owinjore gi tich mane omiyeno.
An alumnus of the University of Leicester, United Kingdom, Tuju had in the late 1980s and early 1990s worked as a part-time television news anchor.	Tuju mane osomo University of Leicester, United Kingdom, e higni mag 1980 kod chak higni mag 1990 ne otiyo kaka achiel kuom jolendo e TV.
Besides, he had produced and directed several documentaries, television and radio commercials for international agencies, private sector bodies and public institutions. 	Ka iweyo mano, ne ogolo weche mageny mag fwambo kod keyo e TV kata radio ne kembe madongo man oko, kembe mag ji kod bede sirikal ma opogore opogore.
And he had been a columnist for local newspapers, particularly the East African Standard.	Osebet ka ondiko e oboke man Kenya ka ahinya e East African Standard.
Tuju’s professional background gave him first-hand experience of how critical media freedom was in a democratic and progressive society.	Bedo ni Tuju ne en achiel kuom joma osomo weche mag lwando weche ne omiyo ongeyo maber duong mar bedo gi thuolo mar wuoyo e weche ma chando jopiny.
It, therefore, did not come as a surprise that while he was at the helm of the Ministry of Information and Tourism, the Kibaki administration nurtured greater freedom of expression. 	Kuom mano ok en gima nyalo buogo ngato ni diere mane en e migawo mar Fwambo kod rwako welo e Kenya, loch Kibaki ne omiyo jo fwambo thuolo mar wuoyo e piny Kenya.
State House kept its hands off media content and tolerated criticism. Further, the voice of the civil society got louder than it had been before.

Kendo jogo ma ngiyo ratiro mar dhano bende ne nigi duol e kenyya ka ahinya ma oloyo kinde mane ose kalo.
In a bid to have Kenya retain her position as the regional centre for international news, Tuju made liberalisation of the airwaves a priority of his ministry.	Mondo mi Kenya ne bedo kaka kama ji biroye wuoyo gi jopiny e East Africa, Tuju ne oneno ni jogo mane dwaro lwando weche e Kenya ka ne ni thuolo mar fwambo kod keyo maonge ywaruok gi sirikal.
Under the Kanu regime, privately-owned radio stations were only allowed to broadcast in limited spaces, but the State-owned Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) enjoyed unlimited airwaves access.	E loch mar KANU, kembe mane ji ochako ne ok oyiene gi lando weche mageny; en mana Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) ema ne nigi thuolo mar lendo gik mageny.
It was during Tuju’s time at the Ministry of Information and Tourism that vernacular radio stations began popping up in large numbers.	Ne en diere Tuju ka ne en minista mar Fwambo kod Welo Welo e piny Kenya ema ne radio stations mag dho udi ma opogre opogore ochako lendo e Kenya ka.
Privately-owned vernacular radio stations such as Kameme FM, which broadcasts in Gikuyu, Kass FM, which broadcasts in Kalenjin, and Ramogi FM, which broadcasts in Dholuo, among others came into existence.	Joland weche e dok ma opogore opogore e Radio machalo Kameme FM, ma lendo gi dho Kikuyu, Kass FM mar Kalenjin kod Radio Ramogi mar Jo-Luo kod ma moko ne ochakore.
Under Tuju’s leadership, the television sector also grew. 	E ndalo Tuju, udi mag television ne omedore e Kenya.
New players such Sayare TV (2004) and K24 (2007) arrived on the scene.	Kembe manyien machalo Sayare TV (2004) kod K24 (2007) ne ochaki.
In addition to other privately-owned television stations such as the Kenya Television Network (KTN), started in 1990, and Nation TV (NTV), started in 1999, the new players in the television sector offered Kenyans a range of sources of information in Kiswahili, Kenya’s lingua franca, English and other indigenous languages to choose from.	Ka omedore gi television stations mamoko ma ok mag piny owacho machalo  kaka Kenya Television Network (KTN), mane ochaki e higa 1990, Nation TV (NTV), mane ochakore 1999, kembe mag TV manyien go ne miyo jo Kenya weche e dhok Kiswahili, dho jo franca, English kod dhok kabila mmamoko mag jo rotenge ma ngato ohero kata ongeyo.
Print media, too, did well thanks to the media freedom occasioned by the change of guard.	Jo fwap weche mag ndiko bende ne odhi maber kaluwore gi telo manyien mar Raphael Tuju.
The two leading dailies, the Daily Nation and the East African Standard maintained their dominance of the Kenyan market.	Jo gazede ariyo madongo ma ongere mar jo Daily Nation kod East African Standard ne omedo bedo gi huma maduong e Kenya ka gin ema ji mangeny ngiewo gi.
But by the end of the first term of the Kibaki Presidency, the number of newspapers in the country had shot up to eight.	To ka ochop gik mar loch mar Ker Kibaki e tich ne ma okuongo, kwan gasede ne omedore e Kenya ma ochopo aboro.
Nation Media Group launched the Business Daily whose beat was finance and economic affairs. 	Nation Media Group ne ochako gazet manyien ma iluongo ni Business Daily mane ndiko weche mag pesa kod dongruolk mar piny.
Patrick Quarcoo’s The Star newspaper also came into existence around the same time.	Ngat ma iluongo ni Patrick Quarcoo bende ne ochako The Star Newspaper e diere mane Rapahel Tuju ne jatend migawo mar fwambo kod rwako welo e Kenya.
Aware of what potent tools media outlets are in the construction of a people’s popular culture, Tuju insisted that the local media creates room for local content. 	Nikech Tuju ne ongeyo ka jo lendo nyalo gero kit ngima jopiny, Tuju ne okone jo fwambo kod keyo ni nyaka gi ne ni weche mag jo Kenya bende omi thuolo e lendo magi.
On August 8, 2003, Tuju announced that from January 1, 2004, local television stations would be required to broadcast a minimum of 20 per cent local content. 	Tarik  8 dwe mar Aboro 2003, Tuju ne olando ni jo fwambo kod keyo man Kenya (TVs) ibiro dwar ni mondo ka ochopo tarik 1.1.2004, mondo obed ni lando ma ok tin ne 20 mag weche matimore e Kenya.
For radio stations, he set the ratio at 30 per cent. Tuju’s directive was not successfully executed then. 	Ne jo Radio, ne okone gi ni nyaka gine ni gilando weche ma jo Kenya timo maromo saja 30 e wi mia. Kata kamano, chik mane Tuju ogolo no ok ne otigo kaka dwarore e ndalo go.
It, however, brought the subject of suitability of media content to the national discourse table.	Kata obedo ni mago ne ok otimore e seche go, jo Kenya ne ochako wuoyo e ber mar chike mane Tuju ogolo go.
As the Minister for Information and Tourism, Tuju took Kenya’s image redemption campaign to the global arena.	Kaka jatend migawo mar fwambo kod rwako welo e Kenya, Tuju ne otero weche Kenya e piny mangima.
Fed up of what in media parlance is called bad press, Tuju attempted to take Kenya’s broadcasting voice to the United Kingdom. 	Ka ok omor gi mying marach mane Kenya nigo e yore mag fwambo kod keyo weche, Tuju ne otero wach Kenya e piny wasungu mar British.
His intention was to reverse the 50-year one-way broadcasting regime that Kenya and Britain had maintained. 	Gima ne odwaro maduong ne en kaka onyalo loko kaka jo Britain kod Kenya ne ose bet lwando weche kuom higni 50 mane ose kalo.
In November 2003, Tuju and Wachira Waruru, then the head of the KBC, visited London to apply for an FM radio station licence to enable KBC to be heard in the UK.	E dwe mar apar ga achiel 2003, Tuju kod Wachira Waruru, mane jatend KBC diere go ne odhi Britain kwayo barua mar yawo Radio station e piny no mar lando weche mag KBC.
The FM station, in Tuju’s view, would offer an alternative voice to that of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).	Ka luwore gi paro mar Tuju, Radio Station mar KBC no ne biro miyo jo Britain thuolo mar yudo weche ma olandi gi station ma opogore gi British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
Tuju argued that unlike the BBC, the Kenya-owned FM radio station would give Kenya unbiased media coverage. 	Tuju ne neno ni KBC ne biro lando weche jo Kenya maber ma oloyo BBC.
It turned out that British broadcasting laws only allowed European companies to run radio stations in Britain.	Ne gi bedo kod buok ni chike mag jo Britain oyiene mana kembe mag jo pinje mag wasungu man Europe yawo station mar Radio e piny mar Britain no.
Besides, at the time all the licences for the London FM spectrum were booked up to 2010.	Ka iweyo mano, seche duto tee ne okonegi ni chiwo barua mar yawo Radio Station ne ok nyal timore nyaka higa mar 2010 nikech ne nitie jogo mane ose ose mi thuolo no.
Even though the law has since changed and non-nationals can now apply for licences and run FM stations in the UK, the challenge of limited FM spectrum persists.	Kata obedo ni sani chike ne ose loki ma yiene joma oa e pinje mamoko mondo oyaw Radio Station e Britain, yudo thuolo ma Radio station manyien nyalo tiyo go pod tek.
Tuju’s fight against the bad press Kenya was getting in the wake of Al Qaeda terrorist attacks was boosted by the fact that it enjoyed the support of Kenyans.	Kedo mane Tuju okedo go gi huma marach mane Kenya obedo go e diere wach Al Qaeda mane ketho gik moko e Kenya ne oung lwedo gi jo Kenya duto.
As a result, Kenya’s tourism industry, the third largest foreign exchange earner in the country, had lost $125 million (Sh13.5 billion) since the 1998 US Embassy bomb attack in Nairobi. 	Nikech huma marach no, welo mane biro Kenya mame kelo ne jo Kenya nwengo mageny mar adek mag pesa ma oa oko, ne owito pesa maromo milion 13.5 chakre higa 1998 mane go US Embassy gi bomb ei Nairobi.
Immediately after the attack, European and American authorities released travel advisories to their citizenry citing Kenya as an unsafe destination. 	Bang ma timre, pinje mag wasungu ma Europe kod America ne olando ne joge gi ni ok ber ka gibiro Kenya nikech nitie jo jore ma nego ji.
The situation had been aggravated by the ban of UK flights to Nairobi and Mombasa by the British government in May 2003. 	Weche ne obedo bedo matek kane jo UK ne oloro huyo mar ndeke gi ma biro Kenya mane piyo Nairobi kod Mombasa e dwe mar Abich 2003.
The ban was anchored on the fear of terrorist attacks on western targets.	Loro no ne otimore nikech wasungu ne oluor ni joge gi ibiro negi gi jo njorego man Kenya.
After his bid to establish an FM station in the UK flopped, Tuju changed tack. 	Bang ka ne ok omedo gi thuolo mar yawo Radio station Britain, Tuju ne oloko paro mar tich.
He made a series of appearances on international radio and television stations. 	Ne otemo wuoyo e Radio kod TV mag pinje man ooko.
Tuju gave one message at each of the talk shows.	Tuju ne lando mana wach achiel e station ka station mane owuoye go.
He informed the world that even though Nairobi was concerned about the terrorism threat, it had taken all the necessary precautions. 	Ne olando ne ji piny mangima ni kata obedo ni Nairobi ne ok mor gi weche mag jo njore man Kenya go, piny owacho ma Kenya ne ose kawo atua mar neno ni ji odak gi kwe.
He emphasised that Kenya was not any more vulnerable to terrorist attacks than other tourist destinations.	Ne omedo lando ni Kenya koro ok ni marach ahinya korka weche ma jo njorore maloyo kunde mamoko ma wasungu dhiye.
Tuju’s crusade paid off. 	Kinda mar Tuju ne okelo lokruok e piny Kenya.
The UK lifted the Nairobi and Mombasa flight ban.	Jo UK ne koro oyiene ndeke gi mondo obi Nairobi kod Mombasa.
He served Kibaki’s administration as the Information and Tourism Minister until 2005.	Tuju ne obedo kaka jatend fwambo kod welo ma biro Kenya e diere loch Ker Mwai Kibaki nyaka higa mar 2005.
His later stint in the Cabinet had much to do with the convulsions that engulfed Narc in the lead up to the 2005 referendum.	Tije ma ogik e bedo e sirikal ne obedo gi weche mageny e diere ma riwruok mar NARC ne dhi bedo gi goyo ombulu mar ngeyo pach jopiny e chike manyien - referendum - mane otimore higa 2005.
Within months of clinching power, cracks emerged in the coalition.	Bange dweche matin ka ne NARC oyudo loch, okak ne ochako bede e kind jo tend riwruok mar siasano mane oloso sirikal.
These cracks assumed the form of a Kibaki-Raila Odinga power-sharing tussle. 	Ywaruok ne obede e kind Kibaki kod Raila Odinga kaka ginyalo tiyo kanyakla.
Odinga claimed that his party and Kibaki’s had signed a pre-election Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that spelt out how they would share power after winning elections. 	Odinga ne owacho ni chama mare kod chama mar Kibaki ne obedo gi winjruok ma ondiki kuom kaka ne gibiro tiyo e sirikal kane gise yudo loch bang goyo ombulu.
The MoU supposedly stipulated a 50-50 power sharing formula between Kibaki’s and Odinga’s parties.	Winjruok gi no ne owacho ni gibiro pogo lemo gi e diere (50-50) e kind chama mag gi mag siasa go.
Jubilee Party head of secretariat Raphael Tuju reminds himself how to use a camera before addressing the press at Elementaita country lodge in Nakuru on November 13, 2016	Jatend Jubilee Party ma en Raphael Tuju temo paro kaka ngato owinjore oti gi picha ka pok owuoyo gi jo fwambo kod keyo e kar nindo mar Elementaita e ngeng' ma Nakuru tarik 13.11.2016
Kibaki never disowned the existence of the MoU.	Kibaki ok ne owuok oko mar kwedo mar mar winjruok mane gibedo go gi Raila Odinga (MoU).
His position, however, was that the MoU was limited to Cabinet slots. 	Gima ne owacho en ni MOU ne owuoyo mana kaka ne gibiro pogo tije mag jotend migepe.
He disagreed with Odinga’s demand that the MoU extended to the civil service. 	Ne ok oyie gi Odinga ni MOU ne owuye kaka ibiro ndik ji tich e piny owacho.
Odinga and his supporters wanted the MoU to overlap to government jobs, diplomatic appointments, State corporations and security services.	Joge Odinga ne dwaro ni wach mar winjruok no obedi e ndiko ji e sirikal, joma ioro tiyo e pinje ma oko kaka ambassodors, joma tiyo e bede sirikal ma opogore opogore kod joma tiyo e migawo mar rito ngima kod mwandu mar Kenya.
The Kibaki-Odinga feud caused divisions in Kibaki’s first Cabinet.	Lweny mane obedo e kind Kibaki kod Odinga ne okelo pogruok e od bura maduong e sirikal mar jotend migawo ma iluongo ni Cabinet mane Kibaki oloso.
It was in this scenario that Tuju, and former vice presidents Moody Awori and George Saitoti switched allegiance to Kibaki.	En e diere ni ma Tuju kod jalup Ker machon Moody Awori kachiel gi George Saitoti ne olokere odok kor ka Kibaki.
The gap between Odinga’s camp and Kibaki’s was further widened by their divergent stances on constitutional reforms. 	Pogruok mane omedo e kind Odinga kod Kibaki ne omedore kaluwore gi pogruok mane gibedo go e wach mar loko chike mag Kenya.
Odinga’s faction used the 2005 proposed Constitution referendum to get even with Kibaki. 	Joge Odinga ne otiyo gi wach mar goyo ombulu mar loko chike mane otimore higa 2005 mondo gi ked gi joge Kibaki.
They rallied their supporters to reject the proposed Constitution. 	Ne giwuoyo gi johera gi mondo kik kal chike mane joge Kibaki dwaro ni mondo obedi e Kenya diere goyo ombulu mar referundum mane otimore higa mar 2005.
Odinga and his supporters wanted an autonomous premier with a ceremonial president while Kibaki and his supporters wanted the opposite of this arrangement. 	Odinga kod joge ne ne dwaro Prime Minster man gi teko mar rito sirikal ka gitiyo gi President mateko ne odok chien. Ma wach mane okwedi gi joge Kibaki kane gin gidwaro ni President obed gi teko mangeny ma ohingo Prime Minister.
The government lost the referendum.	Sirikal ne oyombi e ombulu mar referendum mane owinjore olok chike Kenya.
A day after the government lost the plebiscite something historical happened. 	Mana bang odiechieng achiel ka piny owacho ne oyombi e kura mar referundum no gimoro ne otimore e Kenya.
Kibaki fired his Cabinet save for Vice President Awori and Attorney General Amos Wako. 	Kibaki ne oriembo jotend migepe (ministers) mak mana jalup Ker Moodi Awori kod jatend chike (Attorney General) Amos Wako.
In his terse message to Kenyans, Kibaki clarified that the referendum results had prompted him to reshuffle his ministers and assistant ministers for harmony and efficient service delivery to the people.	E barua mane ooro ne jo fwambo, Ker kibaki ne olero ne jopiny ni duoko mar kura mar referendum no omiyo oneno ni okel lokruok kuom ministers mage kod jolup gi mondo ket joma nyalo tiyo kanyakla ne jo Kenya.
In the new Cabinet that he announced a fortnight later, he excluded Odinga (Roads, Public Works and Housing), Kalonzo Musyoka (Environment), Ochilo Ayacko (Gender and Sports), Linah Jebii Kilimo (Home Affairs and Registration of Persons), Anyang’ Nyong’o (Planning and National Development), Najib Balala (National Heritage and Culture) and William ole Ntimama (Office of the President — Public Service).	E duond od bura mar sirikal (Cabinet) mane olando bang jumbe ariyo, ne ok olando bad migawo mar Raila Odinga mar yore, gero ote piny owacho (Ministry of Roads, Public Works and Housing), Kalonzo Musyoka (Environment), Ochilo Ayacko (Gender and Sports), Linah Jebii Kilimo (Home Affairs and Registration of Persons), Anyang’ Nyong’o (Planning and National Development), Najib Balala (National Heritage and Culture) and William ole Ntimama (Office of the President — Public Service).
In the new Cabinet Kibaki appointed Tuju Minister for Foreign Affairs.	E cabinet manyien no Kibaki ne oyiero Tuju Minister mar weche pinje ma ooko (Foreign Affairs).
From a purely bureaucratic point of view, Tuju’s brief was to advance the government’s foreign policy. 	Ka orange e yo mar tich, tij Tuju ne en siro chike mag sirikand Kenya ma wuoyo kuom kaka onyalo tiyo kanyakla gi pije mamoko.
But from a political angle, Kibaki’s elevation of Tuju to the Foreign Affairs docket was a strategic move. 	Ka ongiye e yor siasa, keto Tuju momdo otel ne migawo mar Foreign Affairs ne en gima nigi lengo mare.
Empowering Tuju was one of Kibaki’s ways preparing for the 2007 political duel with Odinga.	Miyo Tuju teko e sirikal mare ne en plan mar Kibaki mar kedo gi Odinga e wach mar siasa e yiero mane biro timore higa mar 2007.
In the run up to the 2005 referendum Tuju formed the People’s Progressive Party. 	Kane ji chiegni dhi e 2005 referendum, Tuju ne ochako chama ma iluongo ni  People’s Progressive Party.
Political analysts considered Tuju’s party an outfit whose aim was to eat into Odinga’s support base and consequently reduce Odinga’s camp’s chances of winning the referendum.	Joma ngiyo yore mag siasa ma tut ne neno ni party mane Tuju ochakono ne idwaro ni mondo oma Odinga ombulu e piny jo Luo mondo kik obed gi thuolo mar loyo ombulu mar referendum.
Tuju served as the Minister for Foreign Affairs until the end of the first term of the Kibaki Presidency.	Tuju ne obedo Minister mar weche ma ooko (Foreign Affairs) nyaka loch Kibaki ma okuongo mar bedo president orumo.
Interestingly, Tuju, who served as the Member of Parliament for Rarieda between 2003 and 2007, got into Narc thanks to his affiliation with Odinga’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 	Gima ne timore e ndalo no, Tuju, mane obed kaka jaod bura ma Rarieda  e kind higa 2003 kod 2007, ne oyier dhi e od bura gi otiko mar Narc ka oluwo chama mar Odinga ma ne iluongo ni Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
This explains why his fallout with Odinga resulted in him losing the Rarieda seat.	Ma nyiso maler gima omiyo ka ne giwere gi Odinga to ne ok oyiere kendo Rarieda kaka jachung mar gi.
The political animosity between him and Odinga worked to his disadvantage since the electorate considered it a betrayal to their community kingpin.	Lwenye gi Odinga ne ok ochwake nikech jo Luo ne neno ni okedo gi jatend gi mar siasa.
In spite of his loss at the 2007 polls, Tuju did not slide into a political oblivion.	Kata obedo ni ok ne oyiere e kura mane otimore e higa mar 2007, Tuju ne ok olwar e yor siasa.
In a demonstration of the high regard which President Kibaki had for him, Tuju was appointed as Special Envoy and Presidential adviser in the government. 	Kaluwore gi kaka President Kibaki ne ogene, Tuju ne Ker oyiero kaka ja ote mare kendo ja ngad rieko ne piny owacho.
Tuju worked alongside Kivutha Kibwana. 	Tuju ne otiyo kanyakla gi Kivutha Kibwana.
Whereas Kibwana advised Kibaki on Constitutional affairs, Tuju advised him on Media and Management of diversity or Ethnic Relations.	Ka ne Kibwana ne en jangad rieko ne Ker Kibaki e weche mag chike, Tuju ne ngado ne rieko e weche mag fwambo kod keyo kod kaka dho udi mag Kenya nyalo bede achiel.
Tuju served Kibaki as one of his advisers until 2011 when he resigned to focus on his 2013 Presidential bid.	Tuju ne obedo kaka achiel kuom jo ngad rieko ne Ker Kibaki nyaka ne ochopo higa 2011 mane oweyo e tich mondo one ane kaka onyalo manyo kura mar bedo ker mar Kenya e ombulu mane dhi timore e higa mar 2013.
Afterwards, he formed Party of Action (POA), the political vehicle through which he purposed to run for the Presidency.	Bange mano, ne ochako chama mar siasa ma iluongo ni Party of Action (POA), mane omanyo go bedo president mar Kenya.
Tuju was born on March 30, 1959.	Tuju ne onyuol tarik 30.3.1959.
He went to Majiwa Primary School from where he joined Starehe Boys’ Centre. 	Ne osomo Majiwa Primary School kama ne oaye ka odhi Starehe Boys’ Centre.

Before joining politics, Tuju worked as a consultant in design and implementation of public communication programmes.	Kane pok odonjo e siasa, Tuju ne tiyo kaka jangad rieko e weche mag tudgruok mar piny.
Among other organisations and agencies he consulted for were the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States Agency for International Development (USAid), the World Bank, the Department of International Development (DfID) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

At 3am tomorrow, the men’s 3000m steeplechase - a race that has been dominated by Kenyans for 37 years, will take place at the Tokyo Olympics.	Saa 9 kiny okinyi, tugo mar chuo ma iluongo ni 3000m steeplechase - tugo ma jo Kenya ose bed ka loyo kuom higini 37 ma ose kalo, biro timore Tokyo Olympics.
Kenyan men have won the Olympic steeplechase gold medals since 1984.	Chuo Kenya ose bed ka loyo Olympic steeplechase gold medals chakre 1984.
With the absence of defending champion Conseslus Kipruto who did not complete the race during the national trials in June, extension of Kenya’s winning streaks will be on Leonard Bett, Abraham Kibiwot, and Benjamin Kigen who took the top three slots respectively.	Sama koro jangwech ma thiri nginyi ma iluongi ni Conseslus Kipruto ne ok odhi nyime bang weyo ngwech ma itemo go pinje mane otimore e dwe mar auchil higani,Kenya koro nigi geno kuom Leonard Bett, Abraham Kibiwot, kod Benjamin Kigen mane oluwore e kawo namba achiel nyaka adek e tugono.
But a tough challenge awaits the Kenyan squad in Tokyo as African countries field steeplechasers with decorated resumes in the distance.	To jo Kenya man Tokyo nigi tich matek mar kelo loch dala nikech pinje mangeny mag Africa oro jogegi maring omaber e tugo no.
From Lamecha Girma and Getnet Wale of Ethiopia to Morocco’s Soufiane El Bakkali, Kenya’s stranglehold in 3000m steeplechase will be put to test.

Winner of the national trials, former Africa champion Abraham Kibiwott, is seen as the Conseslus Kipruto’s successor.

He won bronze at the African championships in 2016, silver at the Commonwealth Games in 2018 before coming in seventh at World championships in 2019.	Ne oyudo bronze e tugo mar jo Africa mane otimore 2016; ne ochako oyudo  Silver e Commonwealth Games mane otimore higa 2018 kane pok obedo numba 7 e tugo mane oriwo piny mangima - World championships mane otimore 2019.
On the other hand, Kigen, 28, takes to the start line his monstrous kicks. He is seen as the biggest threat for gold.	Kama chielo, Kigen, 28, dhi e line mar ngwech ka en gi ilo. En ema inene kaka ngama nyalo yudo loch mar gold.
Kigen, who won the Rome Diamond League in 2019, in a time of 8:06.13 can’t be wished away.	Kigen, mane oloyo e tugo mar Rome Diamond League mane otimore e higa 2019, e saa mar 8:06.13 ok nyal buon e tugoni.
He has previously beaten El Bakkali and Conseslus at the Diamond Leagues. Back in 2018, he outclassed Kipruto to take Prefontaine Classic before beating El Bakkali on home soil to win in Rabat.	Ediere ma okalo, ne oloyo El Bakkali kod Conseslus e ngwech mar Diamond Leagues. E higa mar 2018, ne odhiero wang Kipruto e tugo mar Prefontaine Classic kane pok oyombo El Bakkali e piny gi mane omiye loch Rabat, kama ne ji piemore.
He has also shown incredible speed with a 3:31 1500 pb in Doha in May, won the only major steeple of 2020 in Monaco, and won his only steeple of 2021 in comfortable fashion, clocking 8:08 in Florence on June 10.

A Wang'uru court in Kirinyaga County has sentenced to death four men found guilty of robbery with violence.	Doho ma Wang'uru man Kirinyaga County nyocha otweyo ji agwen twech mar ngima gi duto kuom kosa mar mayo ji gi yor angenge.
Principal Magistrate Gideon Mutiso convicted Isaak Kariuki Ndambiri, Kennedy Gachoki Kanguru, James Gitonga Wawira and Christopher Bundi Mbogo of killing two people and maiming two others in a robbery incident.

The four, jointly with others not before the court, are said to have committed the offence on July 1, 2018, at a nightclub in Ndindiruku, Mwea East sub-county.

The court heard the four, armed with an AK 47 rifle, also shot and maimed James Kimani and Kelly Nyawira, who can no longer fend for themselves.	Od bura ne owinjo ni ji agwen go mane negi bunde mar AK 47 rifle, ne okielo ma ohinyo James Kimani kod Kelly Nyawira, ma sani ok nyal tiyo tich moro amora sani.
It also emerged that Robert Mwangi, the husband of Ms Mwangi and brother of the late Kimani, was impacted by the robbery since his liquor business went under.	Bende ne ofwenore ni Robert Mwangi, mane en chuor myadendi Margaret Wanjiku Mwangi kod owadgi Kimani mane otho, ne jomecho go oweyo marach nikech ohala mane gigoyo no ne ogore piny.
Mwangi asked the court to give a maximum sentence to the four persons.	Mwangi n e okwayo ja ngad bura mondo omi kuom mager ne jo njore agwen go.
“When they gunned down my wife, I was left with an infant whom I continue to nurture. And under such circumstances, I can hardly go for any meaningful employment,” he said amid tears.	"“Kane ginego jaoda gi bunde, ne adong gi nyathi ma kidoro ma pod arito nyaka sani. To seche ma gima kama otimore, ok anyal dhi manyo tich moro maIongo""Mwangi ne owacho kamano ka pii wange chuer."

Defense lawyer Nduku Njuki, in his mitigation, told the court that his clients were still innocent and the police were yet to arrest the perpetrators of the heinous crime.	Advocate mane ochung ne jonjorego Nduku Njuki, e kwayo ne, ne onyiso kot ni jok mane ochung nigi go ne pod onge ketho kendo polis ne pok omako joma ne otimo tim marach no.
Justice Mutiso ruled that the convicts had not shown any remorse despite committing the serious crime.	Jangad bura Justice Mutiso ne ongado bura ni jogo ,ame omaki ok ne oyie ni ne gitimo marach kata obedo ni gima ne gitimo ne rach ahinya.
“I find the convicts have no respect for others and even upon being given an opportunity for mitigation, they continue to deny having committed the crime which the prosecution and the witnesses proved beyond reasonable doubt,” Mutiso ruled.	“A ayudo ni joma ne omaki gi onge luor gi joma momoko kendo kata obedo ni omigi thuolo mar kwayo nguono, pod gitemo mana dagi ni ok ne gitimo kosa kata obedo ni sirikal kod joneno to ose nyiso maber ni ne gitimo wach marach no. maonge kiawa,” Mutiso ne ongado bura kamano.

Four ex-police officers charged with the murder of British aristocrat Alexander Monson will know their fate on October 28, after both parties closed their submissions yesterday.

The defense lawyers said the prosecution failed to call the bouncer of a club to testify on what transpired inside the entertainment joint before Monson was ejected and later arrested. 	Okil kama loka mane ochung' ne joma iwacho ni ne oneko go ne owacho ni sirikal ne ok oluongo jarit ,ame rito kar od math kama ji ne nitie mondo owachi ni to ango' mane otimore e od math kanyo kane pok Monson ne ogol oko kato bange omake.
Jared Magolo said prosecution and Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) had failed to establish the cause of the fatal injury on Monson's death. He said the state failed Monson's family.	Jared Magolo ne owacho ni joma ochung ne sirikal kod migowo ma mgiyo kaka polis tiyo e Kenya - Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) ne ok onyiso maler gima ne okelo hinyruok mar Monson mane omiyo otho. Ne owacho ni jo sirikal ok otiyo maber ne anyuola mar Monson.
He said that the prosecution failed to call the bouncer of the famous Tanduri night club in Diani that had called police on the deceased after he was allegedly caught smoking cannabis outside the club.	Ne owacho ni joma ochung ne piny owacho ne ok oluongo jarit mane rito kar math ma ongere ni Tanduri Night Club e Diani mane oluongo polis mondo omak jogo ma othono kane oyude ka obadho jaga oko mar clubu no.
“Looking at the circumstantial evidence, investigations let the court and the family of the deceased down by not getting the correct information. There was evidence that a bouncer from the club called the police but he was never called to testify what prompted him to call police,” said Magolo.	“Ka angiyo gima omiyo omaki joma oachung' ne ka, jogo mane timo nonro ok otimo maber ne kot kod anyuola mar ngat ma otho no mikech ok gitimo nonro makere mondo gi yud gima omiyo ngatno ne otho.

Police Constable John Pambe, Naftali Chege, Charles Munyiri Muganda and Ismael Baraka were charged and with the murder of Monson in May 2012.	Polise ma iluongo ni John Pambe, Naftali Chege, Charles Munyiri Muganda kod Ismael Baraka ne odonj negi gi ketho mar nego Monson e dwe mar Abich higa 2012.
Justice Eric Ogoia had found the four had a case to answer and placed them on their defense.	Jangad bura ma iluongo ni Justice Eric Ogoia ne oyudo ni polise agwen go ne nigo kosa kendo mano ema omiyo ne okel gi e kot mondo giwach gima ne otimore e tho mar Monsion.
Magolo said calling for police reinforcement meant that there was confrontation at the club.	Magolo ne owacho ni mondo ne luongi polise mamoko mondo omed biro e kar mathno nyiso maler ni ne nitie ywaruok moro e club kanyo.
“The investigation has never bothered with what happened during the arrest and by leaving out those two areas, they denied you to find out if the injury was caused at the club or at the time of the arrest,” said Magolo.	“Joma nyocha timo nonro mar jogo ma otho no ne ok oneno ni en gima ber mondo gi non ane gima ne otimore sama ne imako ma otho no kendo weyo mar timo nonro kuonde ariyo go, ne gitami ngeyo ka jagono ne ohinyore e clubu kama ne gimethe no kata sama ne imake oko,” Magolo ne owacho kamano.
Magolo said the court and the public will never know who caused the injury and at what stage the injury was caused.	Magolo ne owacho ni kot kod jo piny ok chieng' no nge  ngama ne ohinyo jago ma otho no kendo ni ne ohinye seche mage.
“There is no evidence direct or circumstantial showing that his client contributed to causing the injury or assaulting the deceased,” said Magolo.	“Onge gima nyiso ni jogo ma ochung' negi ema ne ogoyo kendo ohinyojogo ma otho no,” Magolo ne owacho kamano.
He said Monson may have been injured at the cells, police office, during the arrest or at the club.	Ne owacho ni Monson ne nyalo bedo ni ne ohinyore kama ne otere kar keno (cells), e ofisi mar polis, sama ne imake kata sama ne pod en e kar matho kuong'.
“I therefore urge that you find the unfortunate as it is, we have been let down by police and Independent Police Oversight Authority IPOA and left you with no evidence and urge you to acquit the third accused,” said Magolo.	“Kuom mano, ajiwi ni tem mondo inge gima ne otimore kaka en; ok wamor gi nonro mar polis kod migawo ma ngiyo polis (Independent Police Oversight Authority IPOA) ma ok omiyi ;er maber kuom gima ne otimore. Kuom mano,daher mar kwayi ni mondo iwe ngato mar adek ma odonj ne gi ketho mar nek ni,” Magolo ne owacho kamano.
The DPP senior Counsel Alexander Muteti urged the court to find guilty and convict the four police officers charged with the murder of  Monson in 2015 at Diani Police Station.	Jalup ngat mane ochung' ne sirikal e bura ni senior Counsel Alexander Muteti ne otemo jiwo kot mondo otwe polise agwen mane omaki go kuom nego Monson e higa mar 2015, Diani Police Station.
“I urge the court to find the four accused guilty as charged, the deceased having died in their hands,” said Muteti.	“Atemo jiwo kot mondo oyangi ni polise agwen go ne otimo kosa mana kaka sirikal ose lero e andike ma ne wakelo e kot, nikech jago mane otho no ne otho e lwet gi,” Muteti ne owacho kamano.
Muteti urged the court to determine the circumstantial and forensic evidence in determining the cause of death.	Muteti ne omedo jiwo kot mondo ongi gima omiyo iwacho ne polse agwen go ne oneko ma sirikal ne okelo e kot mondo mano ema okony judge ngado bura makare kuom gima ne okelo tho mar Monson.
He said the court should also consider the credibility and believability of the accused in all human reasonable considerations of their defense.	Muteti bende ne omedo wacho ni kot bende owinjore orangi adieri man tie kuom gik ma joma omaki go wacho ka dhano e temo nyiso ni ne ok gitimo makosa .
“I focus on the defense because your lordship you have to deal with the issue of contradictory evidence from the accused persons much so touching on basis of where the assortment of drugs was discovered which is at the center of the arrest,” said Muteti.	“Atemo wuoyo kuom joma omaki nikech - jatelo - nyaka koro irang ane gima omiyo polise ma omaki gi, golo thok ma opogore e wach tho ngatni, ahinya kuom kama ne nyasore mane omake go ni ne oyudore';ma e gima ne omiyo omake maduong',” Muteti ne owacho kamano.
Defense lawyer Daniel Wamotsa said the prosecution was advancing theories that Monson’s injuries were inflicted between 3 AM and 6 AM while he was in police custody but failed to call any witness to prove the same.	Okili ka maloka machielo mane ochung ne joma omaki go Daniel Wamotsa ne owacho ni  sirikal temo wacho ni Monson ne ohiny  e kind saa ochiko otieno kod saa apar gariyo okinyi kane en e lwet polis; to katakamano, onge janeno mane giluongo mondo obi owach gima ne oneno.
Wamotsa said there was no way the age of the injury could be determined as alleged by the prosecution.	Wamotsa ne owacho ni onge kaka sama ne ngatno ohinyore ne inyalo nge gi gima ne sirikal wachno.
He said the prosecution also failed to call in any of the cellmates to testify that the police chose to remain silent under the blue code of silence after injuring Monson.	Okil Ka Maloka no bende nne owacho ni sirikal ne ok oluongo kata achiel kuom jog mane nitie kama ne okane Monson no ka polis mondo owachi ni polis ne ok dwaro mana yango gima ne otimore nikech gin ema ne gihinye.
“We submit Monson case is anchored on suspicion. It is reasonable to suspect but in view of this case, suspicion alone can’t be grounds to convict the accused,” said Wamotsa.	“Kuom mano, en neno wa ni bura mar nek Monson en bura ma onge adieri mare nikech iparo apara ni polis ema ne onege. Onge rach kuom paro ni ngato otimo gimoro to kata kamano e wachni, chich kende ok nyal bedo gima omiyo inyalo twe jogo ma omaki nikech onge ngama ne oneno gi ka  gitimo ketho ma omakne,”  Wamotsa ne olero kamano.
He said there was no motive to the fourth accused to inflict injuries on the deceased and as a junior police officer, he was doing his job.	Ne owacho ni onge gima omiyo ngatr mar agwen ne nyalo hinyo jago ma otho no nikech kaka ngat man gi chewo mar polis man piny, en ne otimo mana tije mane ondike ni mondo otim.
“It is very unfortunate that after all this, we cannot point who inflicted the injuries but it cannot be put on the fourth accused who was at the right place and time,” said Wamotsa.	“En gima rach ni bang magi duto, ok wanyal siemo ngat mane ohinyo Monson to ok nyal wach ni ne en ngat mar agwen ma achung' neni nikech ne en kama owinjore e seche madwarore,” Wamotsa ne owacho kamano.
He said the evidence by Chief Inspector of police indicated that there was no commotion at the club and at the time of arrest.	Ne omedo wacho ni neno mar jatend polis maduong - Chief Inspector of police - ne otemo lero ni ne onge koko mar ywaruok e kama ne ji methe kata sama ne omaki ngat ma otho no.
The four officers will anxiously be waiting for three months to know if they will walk free or head to prison.	Polise agwen go biro rito gi sironyo mar ngeyo kata ka kot biro weyogi kata dweyo gi e jela.

For more than 60 years, the Shonas bestrode the country as stateless people, devoid of official recognition as citizens and denied essential services on account of their status.

“Because we were not recognised as Kenyans we do not have critical identification documents. As a result, we cannot even open our own businesses. We have to use the details of our Kenyan friends to register the businesses,” said Muregerera.	“Nikech ok ne wanger kaka jo Kenya ne wonge gi barupe ma opuodhi gi piny owacho.

A crisis is looming at City Hall after Members of County Assembly (MCAs) resolved to terminate the services of County Attorney Lydia Kwamboka.	Nitie ywruok mnenore ni dhi timore City Hall bang jo chung mag MCAs (Members of County Assembly) ngado ni gi riembo okili ka maloka mar county no Lydia Kwamboka.
The ward representatives on Tuesday adopted a report by the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee that recommended for termination of the contract of Kwamboka for abuse of office and operating without a valid advocate practicing certificate.	Joma ochung ne wards man Nairobi go chieng tich ariyo nyocha opuodho repot mar committee mar Ratiro kod chike (Justice and Legal Affairs Committee) mane owacho Kwamboka mondo ochubgi e tich kuom ketho mar tiyo marach gi ofise kod bedo ni otiyo maonge barua ma nyiso ni en advocate.
"The report stemmed from an investigation by the committee which had been probing a petition by John Mark Ojiambo who sought for the removal of Kwamboka ""on behalf of Kenyan citizens and Nairobi taxpayers.”"	"Repotni ne owuok kuom nonro mar committee no mane temo nono kwayo mar John Mark Ojiambo mane dwari ni Kwamboka ogol e tich ""e loo jo Kenya kod joma odak Nairobi ma chulo osuru.”"
In his petition, Ojiambo claimed that Kwamboka was illegally in office since her one-year contract lapsed in 2018 while she was serving suspension under the then Governor Mike Sonko-led regime.	E dwarone, Ojiambo ne owacho ni Kwamboka ne nitie ofisi ka ok oluwore gi chike Kenya nikech higa achiel mane omiye mar tich ne ose rumo 2018 kane ogole e tich matin gitend Governor Mike Sonko.
On her return, stated Ojiambo, her contract was renewed without vetting as required by law.	Kane oduogo, ne Ojiambo owacho, ndalo ne mar tich (contract) ne omedi ka ok oluwo chik mar nono joma ogwel e tich mar sirikal.
The county attorney was also accused of single-sourcing Njenga Maina and Company Advocates to take up over 60 cases related to City Hall yet the law firm had not been prequalified to offer legal services to the county.	Kwamboka ma en jatend chike e piny owacho mar Nairobi County, bende ne owachi ni omiyo Njenga Maina and Company Advocates tije mag buche maromo 60 mag Nairobi County to kambino ne pok oyiene mar mar timo ohala gi piny owacho mar Nairobi kaka dwarore gi chike mag tender sirikal.
According to the report, the law firm is now demanding Sh300 million in legal fees from the county. It had already been paid Sh60 million in contravention of the Public Finance Management Act, 2012.	Kaluwore gi repot no, kambino mar advocates dwaro ni monddo ochul gi gi sirikand Nairobi County kwan maromo 300 million kaka chudo mar tije ma gise timo kaka ne omigi. Ne ose chule million 60  ma chik matayo weche mag pesa e Kenyamane olos higa mar 2012 dwaro.
“The county attorney allegedly runs Njenga Maina and Company Advocates by proxy and has beneficial interests,” stated the petition.	“Jatelo mar chike go nenore ni en achiel kuom jogo man gi seya e kambi mar Njenga Maina and Company Advocates omiyo pesa ma Nairobi County chulogo nitie kaka konye” dwaro mar Ojiambo no mar thich Kwamboka ooko e tich no ne owacho kamano.
Kwamboka is also accused of nepotism as all the four directorates under her office are headed by people from her tribe.	Kwamboka bende iwacho ni ohero weche mag ndiko wedene tich nikech migepe agwen man e bwo ofise otelnegi gi joma aa e kabinde.
Moreover, the county attorney is accused of engaging in professional misconduct by practicing without a valid practicing certificate. 	Moloyo mano, jatend chike mar sirikand Nairobi County no bende iwacho ni tiyo ma onge barua ma nyiso ni en ngama osomo sheria.
The petition noted that the Advocates Act requires every advocate to take a practicing certificate at the beginning of each year but Kwamboka did not do so in 2020.	Chik matayo weche mag joma osomo sheria dwaro ni advocate mor amora mondo obed gi barua mar tich e chak higa ka higa, gima ne Kwamboka ok otimo e higa mar 2020.
The MCAs said this exposes the county to invalidation of legal instruments and to unwarranted legal action.	MCAs go ne owacho ni wach maka nyalo miyo sirikand Nairobi bedo gi buche mangeny ma kwedo tije ma Kwamboka otiyo kaka jatend chike mar sirikal.
The report by the Justice committee noted that Kwamboka did not honour summons by the committee on July 6, 2021.	Repot mar committee ma ochungne ratiro (Justice committee) ne owacho ni Kwamboka ne ok oluor luong mane oluonge go mondo odhi owach dhoge e nyim committee no tarik 6.7.2021.
In her submissions vide a letter dated July 12, 2021, she claimed she was not aware of the petition by Ojiambo thus it would be procedurally unfair to expect her to respond to the same.	E barua mane ondiko tarik 12.7.2021, Kwamboka ne owacho ni ne ok ongeyo ni nite wach machalo kamano ire mane okel gi Ojiambo e nyim buch jochung' man Nairobi ; kuom mano ne ok onyal bedo gi duoko nikech ok en gima otim kaka chik dwaro.

On the validity of her contract, she maintained that she was duly appointed by Sonko in 2018 but she, alongside three other county officials, were suspended for alleged insubordination over Pumwani Maternity Hospital saga.

“After my suspension, I was recalled on October 1, 2019, where the former governor extended my contact until December 2022,” she said.	“Bang' kane ochunga e tich, ne oluonga mondo aduogi tarik 1.10.2019, kama ne jAtelo machon governor Mike Soko ne omeda thuolo mar tich nyaka December 2022,” Ne owacho kamano.
She also defended Njenga Maina and Company Advocates, saying it had been prequalified and awarded tender NCC/NCM.PREQ/001/B9/2017-18-2018-2019.

This, however, contradicted submissions by County Secretary Jairus Musumba which indicated that the law firm was not on the list of prequalified legal firms that offered services to the county from 2013 up to date.	Kata kamano wach ne no ne ok oluwore gi wach mar County Secretary Jairus Musumba mane owacho ni Njenga Maina & Compamy Advocates ne onge list mar kembe mane oyienegi timo ohala gi Nairobi County chakre 2013 nyaka sani.
Kwamboka further termed the nepotism and incompetency claims as baseless.	Kwamboka ne owacho ni wach mar hero wedene kod tich marach ne onge gi tiendgi.
The Joseph Komu-led committee, however, found that Kwamboka had flouted the provisions of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act, 2021, through the issuance of instructions to an un-prequalified law firm and that she contravened the Constitution on National Values and Principles of Governance.

Based on the observations, it recommended that the county government terminate the services of Kwamboka as the county attorney.	Kaluwore gi weche go duto, ne committee no ne ondiko ni sirikand Nairobi County government owinjore chung Kwamboka e tich kaka jatend chike mag sirikal (attorney).
Consequently, Speaker Benson Mutura communicated the decision of the assembly to Deputy Governor Anne Kananu.	Kuom mano, Speaker mar Bunge mar Nairobi Benson Mutura ne ooro bura mane bunge ne ongado ne Deputy Governor Anne Kananu.
Kananu was also urged to withdraw the services of Njenga Maina and Company Advocates. 	Kananu bende ne okone ni mondo ongad oko tije ma sani imiyo Njenga Maina and Company Advocates.
Kenya’s economy shook off the adverse effects of Covid-19 to post recovery in the first half of the year, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) said yesterday.	Nwengo mar Kenya ne ochako dhi piny nikech tuo mar Covid-19 b ang dhi maber e nus mokuongo mar higano, Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) nyo owacho kamano.
CBK said the rebound was supported mainly by the strong performance of construction, information and communication, education and real estate sectors, with the taxman meeting its tax collection target for the financial year that ended in June.	CBK ne owacho ni dhi maber no ne obede nikech pesa mane luorore kuonde ma igede, weche mag wuoyo e yor mbuyi, somo kod ngiwo udi mane omiyo ja sol osuru yudo pesa mane odwaro e higa no ma nyocha orumo giko dwe mar auchil.
“The economy is expected to rebound in 2021, supported by the continued reopening of the services sectors including education, recovery in manufacturing, and stronger global demand,” said the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), CBK’s highest decision-making organ.	“Dongruok mar Kenya igeno ni biro dhi maber e higa mar 2021, ka nwengo aa kuom ohelni masani omedo yaw machalo education, kuonde ma ilose gik moko kendo dwaro mar gik ma aa Kenya ka dhi pinje ma oko,” Mano e kaka committere ma keto chike e weche mag pesa e Bank maduong mar Kenya ( monetary policy committee of Central Bank of Kenya) owacho ma en ema ongado weche mag pesa e Kenya.
MPC has for the ninth consecutive time retained the Central Bank Rate - the benchmarking rate at which the apex bank lends to financial institutions at seven per cent.	MPC ose weyo chudo ma Central Bank oketo ma ok olokore kuom safar ochiko - ma e kar chudo ma bangi madongo e Kenya miyo go jogo ma holo ji kwan ma gi holo ka iduoko gi shiling maromo abiriyo kuom mia.
Besides improved tax collections, banks also reduced their percentage of bad loans or non-performing loans to 14 per cent - reflecting a pickup in economic activities that have seen borrowers resume servicing their loans.	Ka waweyo choko mar osuru ma odhi maber, kuonde keno bende ne oduoko chien gi kiasi maromo 14 e wi mia -ma nyiso dhi maber e weche mag dongruok mar piny ma omiyo joma yande ne ok chul loan sani chudo maber.
Bank profitability also rose sharply in the first four months compared to the same period last year.	Yuto mar jo Bank bende yande omedore malo e dweche agwen mar higani ka ipimo gi ndalo maka mano higa ma okalo.
There were also efforts to vaccinate the population to enable the society and economy to return to normalcy.	Bende ne nitie chenro mar chajo jo Kenya mondo weche odog e wange.
Nonetheless, respondents in the MPC’s Private Sector Market Perceptions Survey, CEOs Survey, and the Survey of Hotels, were optimistic about economic growth prospects for 2021, citing vaccinations and easing of Covid-19 containment measures.

The submitted budget estimates is proposing to allocate the cooperative department Sh1.6 billion of which Sh1.2 billion is for recurrent expenditure and Sh374.6 million is for development expenditure.

“The submitted estimates for the financial year 2021/22 is proposing to allocate state department for trade and enterprise Sh3.3 billion of which Sh2.1 billion is for recurrent expenditure and Sh1.2 billion is for development expenditure,” read an analysis from the committee on trade, industry and cooperatives.

The 202/2022 Financial Year budget estimates have been prepared against a background of a recovering global economy from the effects of the outbreak and the rapid spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.

There is still uncertainty on when Kenya and the entire world will be able to contain the pandemic, however, there are expectations of a vaccine powered economic recovery with the continued reopening of economies that are improving economic activities.

From insurance fraud, tax fraud and pyramid schemes to the social engineering attacks and cybercrime we experience today, fraud is an issue that has plagued Kenya, and the African continent at large.	Chakre e mecho mag jochiw arita, mecho mag osuru, mecho mag tije michulo ng'ato mana nikech omedo jomoko ma oketo mwandu gi, gi rakruok mag mbuyi mag oganda kod njore mag yor mbuyi ma waneno kawuono, ang'enge en wach malich ma ose gore kuom kenya kod piny Afrika duto.
African nations have been able to develop solutions and implement different measures to combat the effects and occurrences of fraud.	Pinje mag Afrika oseloso yore mag kedo gi yore mecho kod timbe mibadhi.
One sector where fraud is experienced, especially in Africa, is the mobile ecosystem.	Achiel kuom yore ma imayogo ji Afrika en kokalo kuom simo.
Mobile phone and internet penetration are constantly rising, and this has served to increase the size of the sector by giving individuals across different economic segments access to a wider variety of services.	Kwan mag joma tiyo gi simo kod mbuyi siko ka medore, to mae osemedo landruok mag kembe maloso simbego omed loso gik mang'eny ma itimo gi simo.
Despite the advantages this possesses, there are also pitfalls that come with it.	Kata obedo ni simo konyo e yore mang'eny, pod nitie obadho moko ma ikelo kode.
The fight against fraud has been backed by the developments made in technology. 	Dongruoge mitimo e teknoloji osekonyo e kedo gi mibadhi kod mecho.
Seeing as technology has made a contribution towards the growth of fraud, it makes sense that it should be employed to help protect individuals from the negative effects. 	Nikech teknoloji ema osemiyo mibadhi kod kuo onya ahinya, en gima owinjore tiyo gi teknoloji achielno e miyo ji arita kuom mibadhi kod mecho.
So as to ease the burden on regulators and assist them in strengthening their capabilities for fighting fraud, it is important for them to adopt technological solutions.	Ka joma kedo kod mibadhi dwaro mondo gibed gi tich mayot,onego giti gi yore mag teknoloji e kedo kod mibadhi kod mecho.
A report released by Interpol in 2020 noted that the billion-dollar mobile money industry in Africa is being exploited by organized crime groups – a trend only set to increase as the service is rolled out in more countries across the continent. 	Migao makedo gi timbe mahundu miluongo ni Interpol, ne owacho e ripot margi mar 2020 ni nitie jojonjore moko ma tiyo gi kambi moro moloso oro pesa kitiyo gi simo e Afrika, to gino dhi medore e pinje mamoko.
It further highlights that a lack of robust identity checks to verify users combined with a need for greater law enforcement resources and training on mobile money-enabled crimes have created a financial system distinctly vulnerable to criminal infiltration.	Ne giwacho bende gima osekonyo jonjorego en ni nikech onge yo malong'o mar fwenyo joma ioronegi pesa e simo to bende nitie ji matin momi tiegruok mar kedo gi joma kwalo pesa ka gitiyo gi simo.
The fight against fraud must encompass all the players in the sector to guarantee a wholesome approach towards limiting the instances of fraud. 	Kedo gi ang'enge go onego oriw ji duto ma otudore gi weche go eka njore go nyalo dok chien.
This includes the regulators and the mobile network operators (MNOs). 	Ma oting'o jo gundho kod jo ta tudruok gi ong'we yamo miluongo ni mobile network operators (MNOs).
The MNOs are responsible for the development of services for the consumers to use, such as mobile money, as well as their maintenance and growth. 	MNOs ema ochung'ne loso gik ma ji tiyogo e simo kaka yor oro pesa kitiyo gi simo, to kod rito gik ma gilosogo.
In November 2020, Evina - a Paris-based anti-fraud and cybersecurity specialist, released research citing the five countries in the Middle East and Africa where fraud in the mobile ecosystem is most prevalent as Cameroon, Kenya, South Africa, Jordan and Oman.	E dwe mar apar gachiel 2020, Evina-ma en jalony arita mar riasruok mag mbuyi , ne ogolo duoko mag nonrogi ma ne nyiso pinje abich mayudore Ugwe ma Diere kod Afrika, ma kuo mitimo e simo olandore ahinya kaka e piny Cameroon, Kenya, South Africa, Jordan kod Oman.
The regulators are responsible for protecting the consumers and implementing the various checks and balances to assure that consumers are free from exploitation and fraud.	Joma nono wechego tijgi en miyo joma tiyo gi simo arita maber kokalo kuom bedo gi yore ma konyo e geng'o mondo kik kwal pesa ji e simo.
The percentage of mobile-based billing transactions in each country that have been identified as suspect by Evina’s network of fraud sensors are 51 per cent, 30 per cent, 20 per cent, 18 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively and they go further to indicate that about one in four mobile subscriptions in Africa are fraudulent. 	Ata malo mar pesa ma ing'ado e ng'eto ma kalo e ong'we yamo epiny ka piny ma ose yangi kaka ichich go gi tudruok mar fwenyo riasruok mar Evina gin 51, 30. 20, 18 kod ata malo 10 moluwore kamano kendo gi dhi nyime lero ni chiegni achiel kuom ndikruok ang'wen mag ong'we yamo e Afrika gin mag yor mibadhi.
They estimate that Africa’s mobile fraud losses will continue to rise above the 2020 figure of $4 billion if nothing is done to prevent global cybercriminals from looting the digital space.	Gilieko ni alal nikech kuo mag simo e Afrika dhi medore makal kwan mar 2020 ma en dola bilion 4 po nono ni onge okang' moro amora mokaw mondo ogeng' kwelo mitimo e piny ngima e simo kod mbuyi.
There are, however, digital solutions that have been developed to assist the sector in fighting fraud. 	Kata kamano, nitie yore moko ma oseket mondo okony e kedo gi kuo matimoreni.
For example, a report by the GSMA indicates that MNOs have adopted GSMA recommended techniques for detecting and dealing with the international transmission of fraudulent mobile spam. 	Kuom ranyisi, e ripot mar GSMA, nowach ni MNOs osechako tiyo yore ma GSMA oketo mondo gifweny kendo giked gi mecho mitimo e simo.
Thus far, they are yet to be fully adopted in regions such as Africa where they have great potential for success.	Yorego ochigni chak ti go e Afrika kama igeno ni gibiro yudo nyak maber.
In particular, in markets where there is a low-level of technological understanding, consumers today are often not using available protective technology features to their full potential.	To ahinya ahinya, e pinje ma ji ok ong'eyo tiyo gi teknoloji e yo maber, joma tiyo gi simo kinde mang'eny ok ti gi yore teknoloji manyalo ritogi.
Customers within the mobile ecosystem are the most vulnerable of the lot as they often lack knowledge and the technological means to properly defend themselves. 	Joma tiyo gi simo e ma nyalo hinyore moloyo nikech gin ema thothne gionge ng'eyo kendo gikiya tiyo gi teknoloji e ritore giwegi.
Security must be viewed as a chain: one weak-link and the fraudsters rejoice for they interpret this as an open-door for malwares.	Onego wane arita kaka nyororo: ka kamoro achiel ochot, mano chalo ka gima wayawo dhoot ne jomecho ma ginyalo donjogo ma giket gik gi maricho.
James Claude, the CEO of Global Voice Group, believes that it is important we move with the times and look towards digital solutions in the fight against mobile ecosystem fraud. 	James Claude, ma en jata tije mongirore mar Global Voice Group, wacho ni en gima dwarore ni warwak paro ma nya sani kendo wati gi yore mag dijitol e kedo gi mibadhi kod kuo mitimo e simo.
He says, “We live in a world that is constantly evolving, especially from a technological perspective. We therefore have to constantly innovate to stay ahead of the curve and ensure that we maximise on the benefits technology provides us”.	"Nowacho kama, ""Wadak e piny ma siko ka lokore, to ahinya lokruok ma timore e teknoloji. Omiyo wan be nyaka wasik ka waloso gik manyien mondo kik wewa chien kendo wayud ber ma teknoloji nyalo miyowa."""
Global Voice Group (GVG) is a big data analytics company and regulatory technology developer working with several governments and regulators in Africa. 	Global Voice Group (GVG) en kambi maduong' ma nono kendo loso gik mang'iyo kaka itiyo gi teknoloji kendo kambino tiyo gi sirkende mang'eny e Afrika.

The company’s Visio Device solution provides regulators the ability to control the country's handset population in real time, based on reliable and accurate data.	Visio Device mar kambi no miyo jo gundh tije nyalo mar tayo kwan mag ong'we yamo mani tie e pinyno e seche ma owinjore, kaluwore gi weche ma obidhore ma nitie.
This data can then be used to fight counterfeiting and other device-related issues and tackle other types of telecom fraud to ensure an all-round healthy mobile ecosystem.

“Our work at GVG helps us to assist governments and regulators in this effort and some of the solutions we provide are able to strengthen their capabilities when it comes to fighting fraud in the mobile ecosystem. As such crimes move toward a bigger digital arena, it is important to detect them in a much easier and more efficient manner so as to keep all users within the ecosystem safe,” Claude goes on to add.	"""Tijwa e GVG  konyowa mondo wasir sirkende kod joma timo gundho e tekruok ni gi kony ma moko ma wachiwo ni gi nyalo mar tego lony mar gi ka ochopo e go ruok gi riasruok e aluora mag ong'we yamo.

GSMA’s report on Safety, privacy and security across the mobile ecosystem, highlights the importance of mandatory prepaid Mobile SIM registration to protect the mobile ecosystem from fraud.	Ripod GSMA e wi arita mimiyo joma tiyo gi simo, ne ojiwo gimomiyo dwarore ni ji duto ma ng'iewo lain mar simo ondikre mondo ogeng'negi mecho mitimo e simo.
Many countries have strengthened their SIM registration protocols over the years.	Pinje mang'eny osemedo rido chike matayo kaka ji ndikore sama ging'iewo lain manyien mar simo.
For instance, in Kenya, an individual must provide a formal identification document - such as an identity card or passport – for them to register a new SIM card. 	Kuom ranyisi, e piny Kenya, ng'ato nyaka chiw oboke mag nonde kaka opande kata oboke wuoth mar paspoteka ondikre yudo lai manyien mar sime.
This has helped the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) to link each SIM card to a Kenyan citizen or a registered resident of the country.	Mano osekonyo migao mar weche tudruok ma Kenya mondo otud lai moro amora gi Jakenya kata ng'at moyiene dak e piny kenya.
Nonetheless, that cannot be deemed enough and there must be further steps taken.	Kata kamano, ok nyal wach ni mago kende oromo nikech nitie okenge momedore ma onego okaw.
The Visio Sim solution by GVG provides regulators with the capabilities to identify and authenticate users using SIM cards.  	Visio Sim ma ne olos gi GVG miyo joma nono kaka itiyo gi simo nyalo mar fwenyo kendo pwodho joma tiyo gi simo ka gitiyo gi lainde mag simo.
This can help regulators to efficiently certify that any new SIM cards registered comply with the Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements provided by the regulator.	Mano nyalo konyo joma nono kaka itiyo gi simo bedo gadier ni lainde duto ma ous oluwore gi chike mag Know Your Customer (KYC).
Mobile phone penetration is constantly growing at a fast rate and there is need for a system that can assist in the authentication of the individual identities to weed out any potential fraudsters.	Kwan mar joma tiyo gi simo siko ka medore omiyo dwarore ni olos yo manyalo konyo e fwenyo kendo pwodho joma tiyo gi simo mondo gitiek jomecho.
In the recent past, there have been efforts made towards adopting technology across various areas of life.	E ndalo mokalo machiegni, ji osetimo kinda mar tiyo gi teknoloji e yore mang'eny mag ngima.
There have been greater pushes for customers to make use of digital banking solutions, as well as incentives for them to further grow their use of mobile money.	Osebed ka ijiwo ji mondo giti gi bengi mag dijitol, kaachiel kod yore mamoko ma jiwo tiyo gi simo e oro kata kano pesa.
African governments are also putting a greater emphasis on cyber security and cyber resilience to counter the rise in cyber-attacks experienced since the Coronavirus pandemic began.	Sirkende mag pinje Afrika jiwo ahinya medo arita e mbuyi mondo oked gi njore mitimo e mbuyi ma osemedore chakre ne tuo mar Corona bi.
As African economies and the mobile money ecosystem continue to grow, so does the amount of data collected and without efficient systems in place it will be harder for fraudulent transactions and fraudsters to be identified. 	Kaka uchumi mag Afrika medore kendo joma oro pesa gi simo medore, e kaka weche michoko kuomgi bedo mang'eny to ka onge yo malong'o mar pogo wechego, biro bedo matek fwenyo jomecho sama oor pesa e simo.

There are more men owning smartphones in Kenya compared to women giving them an advantage of opportunities in the internet space, a new GSMA consumer survey reveals	Nonro moro ma ne otim gi GSMA ne owacho ni nitie chwo mang'eny moloyo mon matiyo gi simo migwelo, omiyo chwo e ma donjo e mbuyi nyading'eny.
The number of smartphone ownership among men in 2020 went up by four per cent to 47 per cent compared to 2019 ownership at 42 per cent.  	Joma chwo ma nigi simo migwelo nomedore obedo pasent 47 e higa mar 2020 kopim gi higa mar 2019 ma ne en pasent 42.
Ownership among women stagnated at 32 per cent where it was in 2019. 	Kwan mar joma mine ma nigi simo pod en mana pasent 32 kaka ne entie e higa mar 2019.
The study found a majority of women controlling the share of basic phones compared to men with this category of gadgets has grown by three per cent to 34 per cent in 2020 from 31 per cent in 2019. 	Nonrono ne ofwenyo ni kwan mar joma mine kopim gi mar chwo ma tiyo gi simbe kaduda ne omedore gi pasent adek ma obedo pasent 34 e higa mar 2020 to higa mar 2019 ne en pasent 31.

There is a decline in ownership of feature phones across the gender with the adoption of gadget in this category falling 9 per cent among men in 2020 to 14 per cent from 23 per cent in 2019. 	Kwan mar joma tiyo gi simbe mowuok manyien ne odok chien e kind joma chwo gi mine ka kwan mar chwo nodok chien gi pasent 9 e higa mar 2020 mobedo 14 to e higa mar 2019 ne en pasent 23.
The number women opting for feature phones in the country declined by 8 per cent to 11 per cent in 2020 compared to 19 per cent in 2019.	Joma mine ma tiyo gi simbe mowuok manyien e piny ne odok chien gi pasent 8 mobedo 11 e higa mar 2020 kopim gi 2019 ma ne en pasent 19.
The respondents in the research highlighted that the economic impact of Covid-19 pandemic has been felt acutely in Kenya, especially by women.	Joma ne ochiwo pachgi e nonrono ne owacho ni Covid-19 osehinyo ahinya piny Kenya, to ahinya ahinya joma mine.
“While overall mobile ownership remains largely unchanged among men in Kenya and smartphone ownership has grown, overall mobile ownership declined slightly for women, and the proportion of women who own a smartphone has not increased,” the study says.	"Nonrono ne owacho kama: ""Kata obedo ni kwan mag chwo ma nigi simo ok olokore malich Kenya kendo joma nigi simbe migwelo kwan-gi omedore, kwan mar joma mine ma nigi simo ne odok chien kendo kwan mar joma mine ma nigi simo migwelo pok omedore."""
“In addition, Kenya was the only survey country where the gender gap in mobile internet use has widened, from 34 per cent in 2019 to 42 per cent in 2020. Women’s mobile internet use remained flat over this period while use increased for men.”	"""E wi mano, Kenya e piny kende ma ma pogruok ma nitie e kind mon gi chwo ma tiyo gi intanet omedore, koa e pasent 34 e higa 2019 nyaka pasent 42 e higa mar 2020.

The findings in the report draw on the annual GSMA Consumer Survey, which this year had over 9,000 respondents from eight LMICs.	Weche ma nie ripodno ne ondik gi nonro mitimoga higa ka higa gi GSMA Consumer Survey, ma e higani ne owinjo pach ji 9,000 mowuok e pinje aboro mag LMICs.

Additional qualitative research was conducted in Kenya11 and India12 to develop a more nuanced understanding of women’s access to and use of mobile internet, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.	Nonro momedore ne otim e Kenya11 kod India12 mondo gimed ng'eyo kwan mar joma mine ma tiyo gi intanet e simo, to ahinya ahinya e kinde mar Covid-19.
The GSMA report showed an estimated 112 million more women started using mobile internet last year across low- and middle-income countries.	Ripod GSMA ne onyiso ni mine ma dirom milion 112 ne ochako tiyo gi intanet e simo higa mokalo e pinje ma yuto mag ji ni piny kod diere.
Nevertheless, 234 million fewer women than men access mobile internet.	Kata kamano, kwan mag joma chwo mohingo mine e tiyo gi intanet e simo en milion 234.
Moreover, the underlying gender gap in mobile ownership persists and is proving difficult to close.	E wi mano, pogruok mantie e kind chwo kod mon ma nigi simo lach matek bugo.
Affordability, lack of literacy and digital skills, and lower awareness of mobile internet are critical and common barriers for women.	Moko kuom gik mamiyo mine bedo maonge simo en en ni bech simo tek, sombgi ni piny to be ok gilony e weche dijitol, kendo ok ging'eyo kaka intanet tiyo e simo.
Structural inequalities in society and discriminative social norms also remain a challenge. 	Pek machielo ma joma mine romogo en ni ibuonogi.
Even when women have the same levels of education, income, literacy, and employment as men, they are still less likely to own a mobile phone or use mobile internet.

Women were more likely than men to access the internet exclusively via mobile in almost all markets surveyed.	E pinje duto ma ne otimie nonro, ne oyudore ni mine nigi gik mamiyo bedonegi mayot tiyo gi intanet e simo moloyo joma chwo.
In Kenya, for example, 63 per cent of male internet users said they only used the internet via a mobile device compared to 79 per cent of females. 	Kuom ranyisi, e piny Kenya, joma chwo ma tiyo gi intanet e simo en pasent 63 to joma mine en pasent 79.
This reliance by women on mobile demonstrates the disproportionate benefit of increasing their access.	Mano nyiso ni joma mine ohero tiyo gi simo omiyo en tich manono dhi nyime miyogi thuolo mar bedo gi simbe momedore.
“If women are to become equal citizens in a more digital, post-COVID world, closing the mobile gender gap has never been more critical,” said Mats Granryd, Director General, of the GSMA.

I urge policymakers, the private sector and the international community to take note of the important findings laid out in the Mobile Gender Gap Report because only concerted action and collaboration will enable women and their families to reap the full benefits of connectivity.

The tourism industry is on the mend after the devastating effects of the coronavirus pandemic that saw it hit historical lows.	Migawo mochung'ne welo kod bayo ochako timo lokruoge moko bang' ka tuo mar corona omiyo giyudo lal maduong' ma pok no ne.
The industry lost Sh110 billion last year owing to global travel restrictions, according to the Tourism Ministry, raking in a paltry Sh37 billion against a projected Sh147.5 billion.

While there has been a degree of recovery over the first half of this year, the numbers are still a fraction of what they were before the pandemic.	Kata obedo ni gisetimo loso pesa matin e kor higani, kwan mar pesa ma giloso pod ok chopne ma ne gilosoga ka pok corona obiro.

About a third of the arrivals (94,241) were mostly Kenyans visiting their friends and family.	Achiel kuom adiek mar kwan welogo (94,241) ne gin Jokenya ma ne obiro limo osiepegi kod joutegi.

“We are encouraged by the numbers, although we are not there yet because this is only a fifth of the two million visitors we received in 2019. But we understand this is because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdowns that ensued, which affected the travel trends this year,” said Tourism and Wildlife Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala on the new numbers.	"Najib Balal ma ochung'ne migawo mar Tourism and Wildlife ne owacho kama kowuoyo e wi kwan-go, ""Kwan-go jiwowa ahinya, kata obedo ni gin mana achiel kuom abich mar welo milion ariyo ma ne wayudo e higa mar 2019.

The top five tourist source markets over the six months were the US (49,178), Uganda (31,418), Tanzania (31,291), China (18,069), and the United Kingdom (16,264).	Thoth welo ne wuok e pinje abich ma gin Amerka (49,178), Uganda (31,418), Tanzania (31,291), China (18,069), kod United Kingdom (16,264).
The latter has traditionally been the top source market for the local industry but slid following a spat with Kenya that saw it place the country on its Covid-19 red list, restricting passenger travel between the two countries.

Last year, the industry received a paltry 471,000 visitors, more than 68 per cent of them (321,000) arriving in January and February.	Higa mokalo, kwan mag welo ma ne obiro ne gin mana ji 471,000, ka pasent mokalo 68 kuomgi (321,000) ne obiro Januar kod Februar.

“From January to October 2020, the sector realised only Sh37 billion in direct international tourists’ receipts. This is against a projected Sh147.5 billion for the review period,” said the ministry.

The industry has traditionally been the largest foreign exchange earner for the country, earning Sh163 billion in 2019, ahead of tea and horticulture.

Tea earnings grew 15 per cent to Sh120 billion, while horticulture earnings grew to Sh148 billion last year from Sh143 billion in 2019.

He said if the money is released, it would help schools to plan for reopening in July.	Nowach ni kochiw pesano, mano biro konyo skundego ikore ni yepo ma dhi timore e dwe mar Julai.

Kenya Secondary School Heads Association (Kessha) chairman Kahi Indimuli said with schools opening on July 26, proper planning is necessary.	Kahi Indimuli ma en jakom mar Kenya Secondary School Heads Association (Kessha), ne owacho ikruok maber dwarore ka pok oyaw skunde Julai tarik 26.
“Schools will need the money to plan again to receive the children. We need to ensure health protocols are implemented and this will require adequate resources,” said Indimuli.

“We particularly take issue with bars because they are the super-spreaders, and the sooner stricter rules are implemented, the better,” said Maiyo.	"Maiyo nowacho kama, ""Wadwaro ni olor ba mimethee nikech kuno e ma tuo landore ahinya, to ka orid chik mapiyo eka weche nyalo bedo maber berie."""
The release of money is also a major relief to Teachers Training Colleges (TTCs) coming barely a month after the government rolled out fresh training for diploma teachers.

“I did odd jobs in the village, where I earned Sh200 a day for years. But I found an opportunity for free training after the county government structured a ‘Ufundi kwa Vijana’ programme, targeting youth from humble backgrounds,” said Manyeki.

At the height of his popularity and success, the late Jim Rohn, an American entrepreneur, author and motivational speaker aptly said that “reading is essential for those who seek to rise above the ordinary”. 	"E kinde ma ne ong'ere ahinya kendo ngimane ne dhi maber, mosendo Jim Rohn, ma ne en jalok ohala e piny Amerka, jandiko kendo jajiw ji nowacho kama, ""somo en gima dwarore kuom jogo ma dwaro timo gik mopogore."""
This is so true now, as it was back then, especially with children.	Wechenego gin adier e kindegi mana e ndalone, to ahinya ahinya kuom nyithindo.
There is always a world of a difference between readers and non-readers. 	Nitiega pogruok maduong' e kind josomo gi joma ok ohero somo.
And in a school setting, it is remarkably easy to tell apart children who have been introduced to reading at an early age, and those who have not.	E skul, yot ahinya ng'eyo nyithindo ma ne opuonj somo ka gitindo ahinya kod nyithindo ma ne ok ochako somo ka tindo.
Indicators include vocabulary and comprehension, speech performance, levels of imagination, creativity, social skills, ability to empathise or lack of it, concentration levels et cetera.	Gik makonyo ng'ato fwenyogi en weche ma giwacho kod winjo margi, kaka giwuoyo, kaka giparo, kaka gitudore gi jomamoko, nyalo mar winjo lit mar jomamoko, kaka gichiko itgi kod weche mamoko.
Reading is such an understated tool in improving a child’s social and cognitive abilities.	Somo en gima nyalo konyo e medo tiego nyalo mar nyathi mar tudore gi jomoko kendo winjo tiend gik moko.
It is almost magical! And it is a pity and a shame that we have not really embraced it and/or effectively applied it with our young ones.	Somo chalo mana ka hono! To gima lit en ni pok warwake ahinya kata temo puonjo nyithindwa matindo somo.
In most schools that attempt it, library lessons are merely sessions of children reading anything they can lay their hands on, as the teacher marks, plans for the next lesson or finishes up on some work.	E skunde mang'eny matemo jiwo somo, seche ma ji dhi somo e laibrari nyithindo somo asoma gimora amora moriewo e nyimgi ka sechego to japuonj odich gi nono, ikore ne klas machielo kata timo tich machielo.
No guidance, no structure, no follow-ups. 	Ok chikgi, onge chenro miluwo, kendo onge nono ni gidhi nade.
In our case, any serious interaction with books only happens in high school when learners are introduced to set-texts. 	E pinywa, somo mikwano en matimore e skunde sekondar ma nitie buge idwaro ni jopuonjre nyaka som.
And even here, over reliance on the so-called guides by some teachers and students kills the buzz, ruins the party. 	To kata e skundego, jopuonje moko jiwo ahinya tiyo gi buge moko malero e yo machuok buge monego osom to mano miyo jopuonjre ok som bugego aching'.
It defeats the whole idea of introducing children to active reading of truly and deeply and meaningfully savouring literature. 	Timo kamano, miyo bedo ma onge tiende keto nyithindo mondo osom e yo matut buge mamit.
Recent trends in education depict difficulties in teachers helping inspire the appreciation of literature in students.	Gik ma osebedo ka timore machiegni nyiso kaka jopuonj chandore e jiwo nyithindo mondo oher somo.
Unbridled appetite for and unmeasured usage of social media hugely contribute to this.	Gima osemiyo nyithindo ok ohero somo buge en nikech gionge siso kae to be gitiyo gi thuolo mang'eny e tudruok mag mbuyi mar oganda.
And so to counter this, the introduction to literature ought to begin at the earliest levels of education.	Omiyo, mondo gima kamano kik timre, onego ket nyithindo ochak somo buge chon e klese machien.
The contemporary view of the role of literature reinforces the notion that literary texts can be used to teach language beginning at the earliest levels for better nurturing.	Paro ma ji nigo e wi buge jiwo paro ma wachorega ni buge nyalo konyo e puonjo dhok nyithindo ma eka chako somo mondo ging'e dhok maber.
The study of literature encourages empathy, tolerance for diversity, imagination and emotional intelligence, which is the understanding of feelings, both of one’s own and the others. 	Somo buge miyo ng'ato nyago kido mar winjo kaka jomoko winjo, rwako paro mopogore opogore, medo e rieko e paro, kod medo ng'eyo pach jomamoko.
Early interaction with literature equips children with such requisite cognitive skills not only vital in a school or work setting, but valuable in other life aspects.	Ka nyithindo ochako somo buge ka gitindo, mano miyo gibedo gi lony manyalo konyogi e skul, kar tich kata yore mamoko mag ngima.
In the International Baccalaureate (IB), from where the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) happens to borrow heavily, students from as early as Primary Years Programme Grade 5 are introduced to literary appreciation, which helps them acquire key learning milestones that are fundamental for future success – academically and socially. 	E International Baccalaureate (IB), ma e kama Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) ogoloe paro mang'eny, jopuonjre e skunde praimar kochakore gi Grade 5 chako somo buge sigendni, to mano konyogi puonjore weche moko madongo ma biro konyogi e kinde mabiro, e sombgi kod ngimagi.
This includes their cognitive abilities to reflect on their knowledge, conceptual understandings and skills.	Mano oriwo lony mar fwenyo gik matimore mabiro nenore e rieko, winjo kod lony margi.
A wide range of assessment strategies informs learning and teaching of young learners.	Nitie yore mang'eny mag somo makonyo jopuonjre ma pod tindo.
One of the marquee models in IB is the introduction of literature to students at an early age, provoking both artistic and scientific thinking and inquiry. 	Achiel kuom yore somo moket e IB en tiyo gi buge sigendni ne nyithindo ka pod gitindo ahinya mondo okony e chiewo lony kod pachgi.
What is more, it provides language models for children.	Bende, okonyo nyithindo puonjore dhok.
Literary selections also provide authentic cultural information, help critical thinking skills and emphasise historical and literary traditions.	Buge sigendni moyier mondo otigo konyo e puonjo chike kod timbe oganda, bedo gi paro mochwiny kod ng'eyo nonro mag bugego.
The teaching of literature in elementary school using the appropriate pedagogical approaches and models not only develops linguistic abilities, but also offers behavioural models, which will contribute to children’s personal fulfilment.	Puonjo somo kitiyo gi buge mowinjore e skunde michakogo somo ne nyithindo konyo e puonjo nyithindo dhok, to bende gipuonjo nyithindo bedo gi timbe moko mabiro konyo nyithindogo dongo maber.
Unlike our national curriculum, which introduces set texts in high school, the IB programme introduces set texts in junior school (primary years programme) from age 11.	E chenro mar somo ma watiyogo, buge sigendni ichako som mana e skunde sekondar, kata kamano, chenro mar IB to okelo bugego e skunde praimar kochokore gi johigni 11.
This enables learners develop analytical and critical thinking skills, enrich their imagination, relate the artistic works with real-life situations, interrogate topical/societal issues, and develop reading/comprehensive skills.	Mano konyo jopuonjre mondo pachgi oyawre, gibed gi nyalo mar goyo picha e pachgi, ging'e neno gik ma gisomo ka timore e ngimagi, gipim gi weche ma nie alwora margi, kendo ging'e somo kod winjo tiend gik ma gisomo.
According to a June 2018 research done by Cynthia Zettler-Greeley, Assistant Director, Research and Evaluation, at Nemours Centre for Health Delivery Innovation in the United States, children in the fourth through to the eighth grade (ages 9–13) are best modelled to be introduced to set texts.	Kaluwore gi nonro ma ne otim Jun 2018 gi Cynthia Zettler-Greeley, ma en dairekta makonyo e kama Itimoe Nonro, e Nemours Centre for Health Delivery Innovation mantie Amerka, nyithindo manie Grade 4-8 ( johigni 9-13) owinjore ochak somo buge sigendni.
These children usually have the ability to explore and understand different kinds of texts such as biographies, poetry and fiction; understand and explore expository, narrative and persuasive text; read to extract specific information, such as from a science book; understand relations between objects; identify parts of speech and devices like similes and metaphors; correctly identify major elements of stories like time, place, plot, problem and resolution; and most importantly analyse texts for meaning.	Nyithindogo nigi nyalo mar somo kendo winjo tiend buge malero ngima jomoko, buge moting'o wende kod sigendni mochuogi, ginyalo winjo buge malero weche moko, buge ma magano weche; ginyalo somo mipuonjre gimoro e buge moting'o weche sayans; ginyalo neno tudruok mantie e kind gik moko; ginyalo fwenyo weche motigo kaka ngeche kod ranyisi; ginyalo fwenyo gik madongo e sigana kaka kinde, kama gino otimore, gima iwuoyoe, wach ma nitie kod kaka iloso wachno; to gimaduong' en ginyalo somo ma giyud thor wach ma ilosoe.
In the case of introducing children to reading in general, she states that most children learn to read by six or seven years of age.	To kodok korka puonjo nyithindo duto ng'eyo somo, owacho ni thoth nyithindo chakoga somo ka gin johigni auchiel kata abiriyo.
Occasionally, some children may learn at four or five years of age. In the first and second grade (ages 6–7), children usually begin to read familiar stories, “sound out” or decode unfamiliar words, use pictures and context to figure out unfamiliar words, and self-correct when they make a mistake while reading aloud.	Nitie seche moko ma nyithindo nyalo chako somo gi higni ang'wen kata abich. E grade 1 kod 2 (johigni 6-7), nyithindo chakoga somo sigendni moko ma ging'eyo, puonjore luongo weche moko, tiyo gi pichni e ng'eyo kaka iluongo weche moko, kendo girieyore giwegi sama ok gisomo maber ka ne gisomo matek.
Children’s literature is important because it provides students with opportunities to respond to and interrogate literary elements; gives students appreciation about their own cultural heritage as well as those of others; helps students develop emotional intelligence and creativity; nurtures growth and development of the student’s personality and social skills; and transmits important literature and themes from one generation to the next.	Buge nyithindo gin gik madwarore ahinya nikech gimiyo jopuonjre thuolo mag dwoko penjo moko sama gisomo; gimiyo jopuonjre hero sigand anyuolagi kod mag jomoko; konyo e yawo pach jopuonjre; konyo japuonjre timo dongruok e kido mare kod kaka otudore gi ji; kendo bugego miyo tieng' achiel ng'eyo kaka ngima ne chalo e tieng' machielo.
The first value to note is that children’s literature provides students with the opportunity to develop their own (informed) opinions about the thematic concerns, logically defend their positions, and develop communication and persuasive skills to articulate their thoughts.	Gima onego wakwong wang'e en ni buge nyithindo miyo jopuonjre thuolo mar wacho pachgi e wi gima buk wuoyoe, giler e yo mawinjore pachgi, kendo ging'e wuoyo mochanore maber sama giwacho pachgi.
This strengthens the cognitive developmental domain as it encourages deeper thought about literature.	Mano konyo e miyo ji obed gi paro moyawore nikech ojiwo ji mondo opar matut kuom buge misomo.
Quality literature does not tell the reader everything he/she needs to know; it allows for some difference in opinion, interpretation and decoding of information.	Buk maber ok nyisga jasomo gima onego ong'e, kar mano omiye thuolo mar bedo gi paro mopogore, winjo kendo lero tiend wach mondik.
Early introduction to literary appreciation provides an avenue for students to learn about their own cultural heritage and the cultures of other people.	Chako somo buge sigendni chon miyo jopuonjre yo mar ng'eyo nonro e wi ogandagi kod timbe jomamoko.
Children’s literature encourages students to think deeper about their own feelings.	Buge nyithindo konyo jopuonjre paro matut kuom kaka gin giwegi giwinjo e wi wach moro.
It is crucial for children to learn these values because developing positive attitudes toward our own culture and the cultures of others is necessary for both social and personal development, mutual understanding and even tolerance to diversity.	Magi gin gik ma dwarore ni nyithindo opuonjre nikech sama ng'ato obedo gi paro mowinjore e wi oganda mare kod mag jomoko, mano konye mondo otim dongruok e kite kod tudruok mare gi jomoko, to mano miyo obedo gi kuwe gi jomoko kendo onyalo rwako paro mopogore ma ji nigo.
Stories have the power to promote emotional and moral development.	Sigendni nigi teko mar miyo ng'ato obed mochwiny e pache kod timbene.
Many books are available that depict culture as an important piece of society that is to be treasured and valued, and those books can have great value for students.	Nitie buge mang'eny mawuoyo e wi kaka timbe mag oganda e gimaduong' ma ji onego gen, to bugego nyalo konyo ahinya jopuonjre.
Moreover, early literary appreciation aids students in developing emotional intelligence	E wi mano, chako somo buge ka nyithindo pod tindo konyo e yawo pachgi.
Children’s literature contains numerous moments of crisis, when characters make moral decisions and contemplate the reasons for their decisions, an important skill for children to be modelled in.	Buge nyithindo niga gi sigendni ma nigi akere keke, tiende ni sama gimoro timoro to koro ng'ato nyaka par matut ka pok ong'ado yiero, to mano en kido maber ka okony nyithindo mondo obedgo.
Literature for children encourages creativity.	Buge nyithindo konyogi mondo giti gi pachgi.
It nurtures and promotes/expands the development of children’s internal imagination.	Bugego yawo pach nyathi kokonye bedo gi nyalo mar chuogo gik moko e pachgi.
Children’s literary appreciation is of value because it fosters personality and social development. 	Ber ka nyithindo ohero somo buge nikech mano miyo gibedo gi timbe mabeyo kendo ging'eyo dak gi ji.
Children are very impressionable during their formative years, and children’s literature can help them develop into caring, intelligent and friendly people.	Yot ahinya puonjo nyithindo e higni ma pod gidongo, kendo buge nyithindo nyalo konyogi bedo joma ng'won, jomariek kendo joma ohero ji.
Developmental psychologist Jean Piaget observed that when students move from the pre-operational to the operational stage of cognitive development, they become less egocentric.	Jean Piagnet ma en laktar molony e kaka pach ji dongo, nofwenyo ni sa ma nyithindo ochako dongo ma koro gifwenyo gik matimore e alworagi, giweyo bedo joguondo.
Whereas students in preschool and kindergarten may be entirely focused on themselves, as students grow older they begin to take into account the feelings and viewpoints of others.	Nyithindo ma pod nie nasari skul oketoga pachgi kuomgi giwegi, to kaka gimedo bedo madongo, gichako dewo pach jowetegi kendo chiko negi itgi.
Being able to understand other people’s viewpoints and to not be selfish are important skills that must be nurtured in children, since harmonious interactions and fulfilling relationships require an understanding of the feelings and viewpoints of others.	Dewo pach jomoko kendo weyo bedo jaguondo gin kido maber ka nyithindo obedogo, nikech ka ji dwaro ni gidag gi kuwe gi jowetegi, onego gidew paro ma jomoko nigo kendo gichik negi itgi.
Children’s literature can foster social development by encouraging students to accept other people and their differences, develop relationships with people and encourage social contact.	Buge nyithindo nyalo konyo japuonjre mondo otim dongruok e winjruokne gi jomoko kokalo kuom jiwo jopuonjre mondo girwak jomoko kata ka gipogore kodgi, gibed gi winjruok gi ji kendo gilos osiep.
Based on psychologists Jean Piaget and Vygotsky’s development theories, a child needs to be exposed to developmentally appropriate (age appropriate) reading in order for learning to occur; and in order for literacy development to occur, a child must read.	Kaluwore gi weche ma nowach gi Jean Piagnet kod Vygotsky, mondo nyathi opuonjre gimoro onego omiye somo ma owinjore gi hike, to mondo nyathi ong'e somo, nyaka osom.
Therefore, a child must be exposed to literature that is suitable for them based on their abilities.	Omiyo, nyaka mi nyathi buk mowinjore kode kod nyalo mare.
Children’s literature is valuable in providing an opportunity to respond to literature, as well as cultural knowledge, emotional intelligence and creativity, social and personality development and literature history to students across generations.	Buge nyithindo konyo ahinya e miyo ji hero buge, ng'eyo weche ogandagi, yawo pach ng'ato, konyo ng'ato timo dongruok e kite, kendo bugego miye tienge mabiro ng'eyo weche ma ne ondik chon.
Exposing children to quality literature can contribute to the creation of responsible, successful and caring individuals.	Keto nyithindo mondo ochak somo buge sigendni chon konyo mondo gibed joma inyalo gen, ngimagi odhi maber kendo gibed joma ng'won.
As students get older, the set-texts become more complex and demanding.	Kaka jopuonjre medo bedo madongo, e kaka buge ma gisomo igi medo bedo malach kendo mogajore.
The information in the text also places a greater emphasis on higher level thinking and prior knowledge.	Weche mondik e bugego be dwaro paro motegno kendo mochwiny.
Specifically matching texts to the learners’ interests, prior knowledge and reading abilities was found to be essential in heightening motivation, enhancing confidence, and developing and applying specific reading comprehension strategies.	Ne oyudore ni buge mondik ma dhi kanyachiel gi gima jasomo oher, gik moseng'eyo kod lony mare mar somo konyo ahinya e chiwo jip, medo ng'ato chir, kendo nyago kod tiyo gi yore moko sie mag somo.
Introducing children to early literature braces students for such demands.	Ka nyithindo ochako somo ka gitindo, mano ikogi ne wechego.
Conversely, delays or failure in introducing children to literary appreciation have far-reaching ramifications. First is the misplaced notion, self-defeating mentality that reading should only be done for purposes of exams, as opposed to a self-development tool	To komachielo, ka nyithindo odeko gi chako somo bugego, nitie gik mang'eny ma ok beyo matimore. Mokwongo en paro ji nigo ni ji onego osom mana mondo gikal penj to ok ni mondo gik ma gisomogo okonygi.
This is sickening, to say the least.	Mano en paro marach ahinya.
Besides slow or delayed cognitive development, individuals who are not introduced to early literary appreciation tend to be socially awkward and maladjusted, lacking in empathy, shallow in their reasoning and dogmatic in their thinking.	Joma odeko gi somo bedoga joma winjo margi ni piny, kendo gikiya wuoyo gi ji, ok ging'eyo pach jomoko, pachgi tin kendo gichuno ji gi pachgi.
They are wont to struggle in terms of their communication skills, have a narrow world view and lack attention to detail.	Gikiya loso kata tudruok gi ji e yo malong'o, pachgi tin e yo ma ginenogo gik moko kendo ok ginyal fwenyo weche moko.
Competencies such as speed reading, comprehension skills, critical thinking skills et cetera, developed as a result of early introduction to literary appreciation would almost guarantee easy, faster and better understanding and even mastery of other subjects and skills.	Lony kaka somo piyo, nyalo mar winj tiend weche, paro matut kod mamoko gin lony ma biro nikech chako somo ka ng'ato pod tin to mago lony makonyo e winjo kendo ng'eyo weche mamoko.
The benefits of introducing the young ones to early reading and literary appreciation are innumerable and far outweigh the pitfalls, if any.	Keto nyithindo mondo ochak somo buge ka gitindo en gima nigi ber mathoth moloyo rach po nono ni nitie moro amora.
Aday to the talks between the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) and teachers’ unions on the new proposed Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), signs of striking a compromise are beginning to emerge.	Kodong' mana odiechieng' achiel kende to Teachers Service Commission (TSC) romo kod riwruoge mag jopuonje mondo giwuo e wi winjruok manyien mar Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), nitie gik manyiso ni gidhi tur.
The Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut), which had previously objected to a CBA without monetary gains as proposed by TSC, is now climbing down and suggesting a possibility of having an agreement with a condition that the suspension only lasts two years.	Riwruok mar Jopuonje Kenya (KNUT) ma yande okwedo CBA ma onge pesa ma gidhi yudo kaka TSC dwaro, koro otur kendo giwacho ni ginyalo chopo e winjruok mak mana ka ok omigi pesa kuom higni ariyo kende.
TSC has scheduled a meeting with teachers’ unions to negotiate the proposed CBA, as pressure mounts on the latter to accept a deal without monetary gains.	TSC ochano romo gi riwruok mar jopuonje mondo giwuo e wi CBA, to e sechego riwruok mar jopuonje isindo mondo oyie gi winjruogno ma ok giboyudoe pesa.
The commission invited the unions to the July 13 meeting to discuss the 2021-2025 CBA. At a meeting held on June 29, TSC had said it would not engage in money-based CBA.	TSC ne ogwelo riwruogego mondo ochop e romo ma dhi timore tarik 13 Julai mondo giwuo e wi 2021-2025 CBA. E romo ma ne otim Jun tarik 29, TSC ne owacho ni ok gibiwuyo wi wach pesa e winjruok mar kanyakla.
Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) secretary-general Collins Oyuu yesterday said they were willing to get into an agreement with the employer on a two-year CBA that captures all other aspects of terms and later sign a different CBA on financial gains.	Jagoro maduong' mar Riwruok mar Jopuonje Kenya (KNUT), Collins Oyuu, nyoro ne owacho ni giyie donjo e winjruok gi jatendgi e wi winjruok mar kanyakla makawo higni ariyo mokwako weche mamoko duto to bang'e gipwodh CBA machielo mabiro miyo giyud pesa.
“Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) has suspended the review of salaries and teachers are not exceptional, but must agree with the TSC that teachers’ salaries will be reviewed immediately after the lapse of the suspension period depending on the country’s economic performance,” said Mr Oyuu.	"Oyuu nowacho kama, ""Migawo Mochung'ne Chulo Osara (SRC) sani ok dwar wuoyo e wi wach medo ji osara, jopuonje ok gin joma kende, kata kamano nyaka giwinjre gi TSC ni osara mag jopuonje ibiro non kendo bang' kinde ma ne ochor nyime kaluwore gi uchumi mar piny."""
At the same time, the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) Nairobi branch executive secretary Moses Mbora has urged the national office to follow suit.	E sechegogo bende, jagoro maduong' mar Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) ne ojiwo ofisgi maduong' mar Nairobi mondo gin be gitim kamano.
Previously, the Kuppet secretary-general Akello Misori had announced that they were reluctant to accept a CBA that does not include salary increments for teachers.	Noyudo ka chien kanyo, Akello Misori, ma en jagoro mar Kuppet nolando ni ok giyie gi winjruok mar kanyakla ma ok oyie mondo omed jopuonje osara.
TSC’s stand on non-monetary CBA rose from advice from the SRC that put a freeze on the review of salary structure.	TSC omakore gi CBA maonge wach pesa kaluwore gi paro manochiw gi SRC ma ne omiyo giweyo wuoyo e wach osara.
SRC pronounced that it would not review basic salary structures, allowances, and benefits for public servants, including teachers, in the financial year 2021/2022 and 2022/2023, following recommendations from the National Treasury.	SRC nolando ni ok gibi nono osara kod chudo duto ma imiyo joma sirkal ondiko tich, moriwo nyaka jopuonje, e hik omenda mar 2021/2022 kod 2022/2023 kaluwore gi paro ma ne ochiw gi Migawo Mar Omenda e Piny.
The unions previously maintained that teachers expected nothing short of salary increment to cushion them against inflation and the burdens of increased workload under the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) coupled with a biting teacher shortage.	Riwruoge mag jopuonje ne oramo ni jopuonje ok dwar winjo wach moro amora mopogore gi meto mar osara nikech ngima ma omedo ridore kod tich momedore e chenro mar Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) gi jopuonje matin.
In the June meeting with teachers’ unions, TSC offered promotion of teachers in arid and semi-arid land (ASALs) and hardship areas, enhanced package on maternity leave to 120 days and paternity leave of 21 days with full salaries, as well as transfers of couples to teach in schools near each other.	E romo ma ne otim e dwe mar Jun, TSC ne owacho ni gidhi medo ngas jopuonje mantie e alwora motwo kod ma ngima tekie, ndalo ma ng'ato kawo ka en ot nikech onyuol en 120 to chwo ma mondegi onyuol en 21 to idhi migi osara mopong' e ndalo ma gin ot, joma okendore ne idhi ter e skunde ma machiegni kodgi.
“We are looking at a CBA that does not break families. Let us not only concentrate on the financial gains because the CBA has so many aspects,” said Oyuu.	"Oyuu nowacho niya, ""CBA manyienni ok pog udi. Kik waket pachwa ahinya e wach pesa nikech CBA okwako gik mang'eny."""
The new CBA seeks to recognise teachers’ leadership and technical roles in realisation of the CBC within and outside the classroom, which had been ignored in the evaluation tool previously used by SRC in crafting teachers’ job descriptions.	CBA manyien rango lony ma jopuonje nigo e tayo kod migepe mamoko ma dhi konyo e chopo chenro mar CBC ka gin e klas kod oko, ma en gima nojwang' ka SRC nono weche ma giketo ka gilero tij japuonj.
Implementation of the CBA would be a boost for classroom teachers as it recognises the role they play in implementation of the CBC.	CBA manyienno ka otiyo to obiro konyo jopuonj nikech ong'eyo kama jopuonjo omako e chopo chenro mar CBC.
The unions are pushing for the implementation of the four-year agreement as it focuses more on the true worth of teachers as the country transitions to an education system that subjects them to more work. 	Riwruoge mag jopuonj chwalo mondo winjruok madhi kawo higni ang'wen-go otimre nikech winjruogno jiwo ahinya migawo ma jopuonje omako sama piny timo lokruok e chenro mar somo medo jopuonje tich momedore.
No review of basic salary structure, allowances and other benefits for the period 2021/2022to 2022/2023 means job grades, salary bands from Minimum to maximum within grades, allowances and other benefits remain the same. [Jacinta Mutura]	Onge nono osara kod chudo moro amora e kinde mar 2021/2022 nyaka 2022/2023 tiende ni migepe mag tich, osara mag ji kochakore gi matin nyaka mamalo, kod chudo mamoko biro dong' ma onge lokruok moro amora. [Jacinta Mutura]
This also implies that employees can enjoy annual increments and promotions from one grade to another through common cadre transitions and competitive interviews at constant salary bands, allowances and other benefits.	Mano be tiende en ni joma ondik tich inyalo med chudo moko kata tich e higa koa e kidieny moro kadhi e kidieny machielo kokalo kuom wilruok mitimo ne joma nie kidieny marom kod piem e wi kidieny mag osara kod yuto mamoko ma nitie.
Teachers had been expecting to get new terms for the 2021-2016 CBA hoping that the next CBA shall resolve challenges that were not conclusively addressed by the last one.	Jopuonje ne nigi geno ni 2021-2026 CBA ne biro gi weche moko manyien ka ne giparo ni CBA ma dhi luwo ne loso chandruoge ma ne otamo machon tieko.
Both Kuppet and Knut had separately presented their salary proposals to inform negotiations with TSC.	Kuppet kod Knut ne ochiwo kwayo margi e wich osara ne TSC.
Kuppet had pitched a salary increment of between 30 and 70 per cent for the new 2021-2026 while TSC is reported to have proposed between 16 to 32 per cent.	Kuppet ne okwayo mondo omedgi osara ma nie kind pasent 30 kod 70 e winjruok manyien mar 2021-2026, to TSC wachore ni owacho mondo omigi pasent 16 nyaka 32.
The Kuppet proposal would see the lowest paid teacher’s salary rise from Sh21,756 to Sh36,985 while those in higher cadres under Job Group D4 who currently earn Sh118,242 would take home Sh153,714.	Kwayo mar jo Kuppet nyiso osara matin mogik mar japuonj ne medore koa e siling' 21,756 nyaka siling' 36,985 ka mago mani e oreya ma malo e kidieny mar D4 ma sani yudo siling' 118,242 ne dhi tero dala siling' 153,714.
Knut had also proposed a salary increment of between 120 and 200.	Riwruok mar jopuonj bende ne ose choro kwayo mar meto osara e kind 120 kod 200.
The Knut proposal means the monthly basic salary for the lowest paid teacher (Grade B5) would be raised from Sh21,756 to a maximum of Sh87,024 while salary of the highest paid teacher (Grade D5) would be increased from Sh131,380 to Sh394,140.	Kwayo mar jo Knut tiende ni osara matin ma japuonj yudo e dwe (Kidieny mar B5) ne dhi medore koa e siling' 21,756 machop siling' 87,024 to komachielo osara mamalo mogik michulo japuonj (Kidieny mar D5) ne dhi medore koa e siling' 131,380 machop siling' 394,140.
Teachers are also hopeful that the CBA will streamline guidelines for competitive promotion interviews to enable Special Needs Education teachers to compete fairly with teachers handling normal learners.	Jopuonje geno ni CBA biro konyo mondo oyuo chike matayo penj mimiyogi sama gidwaro idho ngas e tich mondo jopuonje mapuonjo nyithindo ma nigi dwaro makende, obed machal gi mar jopuonje ma pile.
At Ndagani in Tharaka Nithi County, college students and young pupils have for a month learnt to co-exist in a tuition block they share.	E Ndagani mantie e Kaonti mar Tharaka Nithi, jopouonjre mag kolej kod jopuonjre matindo koro osebedo ka somo kamoro achiel kuom dwe achiel.
The college students, most in their teens and early 20s, have been sharing a compound with a baby class and two other classes in the Early Childhood Development Education centre.	Jopuonjre mag kolej, ma thothgi gin rowere matindo kod hikgi nie kind 20, osebedo ka somo kanyachiel gi jo klas nyithindo matindo ahinya kod klese ariyo mamoko e kar tiego dongruok nyithindo.
In a rare scenario, the primary school pupils and the students intermingle as they move around their classrooms, stairs and along the corridors at the tuition block near Chuka University.	Ok en gima yot neno ka nyithind praimar kod jo kolej ka ni kamoro achiel ka giwuotho e klas, stairs kod korido e kar tiegruok mantie but Chuka University.
The college's lecturers also have offices and lecture halls in the single tuition building, albeit on the upper level.	Jopuonje mag kolejno nigi ofise kod klese ma gipuonje e kar tiegruok achielno, e ute man malo.
Older pupils such as Class Seven and Eight take the advantage of the proximity to engage the older students for advice.	Nyithindo madongo kaka joklas abiriyo kod aboro, tiyo gi thuolono e wuoyo kod jo kolej mondo okony gi nikech gin machiegni.
Chuka University VC Prof Erastus Njoka addressing Kenya Medical Training College students outside the building they occupy inside the university. 	Ogaye mar mbalariany ma Chuk  Ngire Erastus Njokam, ka ne owuoyo gi jopuonjre magkar tiegruok weche thieth ka gin oko mar ot ma gintie e yunivasitino.
The university council allowed, in 2015, KMTC to occupy the building which belongs to Ndagani Primary School, as the construction of KMTC campus at Chuka Level Five Hospital continues	Bura mar yunivasitino ne oyiene kar tiegruok weche thieth e higa mar 2015 mondo giti gi odno ma ne mar Ndagani Primary School, e thuolo ma pod igero kar tiegruok mar kar tiegruok weche thieth e kar Thieth ma Chuka Level Five.
When the bell rings, the pupils make their usual dash to the classrooms, and the college students have learned to give way when that happens.	Sama olang' oywak, nyithindo ringo ka dhi e klas, to jopuonjre mag kolej sani koro ong'eyo weyo negi yo sama mano otimore.
Friendships have also been struck, and it is not uncommon to see a group of pupils in animated chatter with their older counterparts.	Gimako osiep kendo yot neno ka jo praimar goyo mbaka gi jo kolej.
But to maintain respect and seniority, the pupils have been allocated separate toilets and they dare not venture into ones meant for the college.	Kata kamano, mondo luor bedie, jo praimar tiyo ti cho mopogore kendo ok oyienegi dhi e choche jo kolej.
But many things could go wrong in this arrangement, though luckily, it is yet to happen.	Nitie gik mang'eny manyalo timore marach e chenroni, en mana ni pok gitimore.
It is a situation brought about by the delayed construction of the Kenya Medical Training College complex at Chuka Level Five Hospital, which has forced its students to share a building with pupils at Ndagani Primary School.	Gima omiyo mano timore en nikech gedo molewo mar kar tiegruok weche thieth mitimo e Kar thieth ma Chuka Level Five, to mano ochuno jo kolejno mondo oriwre gi sikund praimar mar Ndagani
While the college students occupy the upper floors of the building, the pupils have been moved into a section of the first and ground floors.	Jopuonjre mag kolej tiyo gi ute man malo, to nyithi praimar ne odar mondo oti gi ute man piny kod e gorofa mokwongo.
The building belongs to the primary school but KMTC has occupied it as it awaits completion of its campus.	Odno en mar jo skund praimar, kata kamano kar tiegruok weche thieth tiyo kode ka girito mondo otiek gernegi kargi.
The primary school was moved on May 10 from its former location, in a land swap with Chuka University which is using the land to construct a library.	Ne odar joskund praimarno tarik 10 e dwe mar Mei, ka ne gi wilo lo gi Chuka Ujniversity matiyo magero laibrari e lobno.
A teacher from the primary section told The Standard: “The pupils and teachers cannot wait to have the entire building to themselves. The university built this complex as a model primary school.”	"Japuonj skund praimarno ne onyiso The Standard niya, ""Nyithindo kaachiel gi jopuonje rito gi siso mondo kanyo odong'negi kendgi. Mbalariany nogero kanyo mondo skund praimar mondisore."""
The KMTC campus in Tharaka Nithi County was approved six years ago but Chuka University accommodated the first batch of its students in a compound that belonged to Ndagani Primary School, within the university compound.	Ne opwodh mondo gedo mar kar tiegruok weche thieth ochakre higni auchiel mokalo e Kaonti mar Tharaka Nithi, kata kamano, Mbalariany ma Chuka ne okawo mana kidieny mokwongo mag jopuonjre kendo giketogi kar jo sikund praimar ma Ndagani mantie ei lop mbalariany.
Vice Chancellor Prof Erastus Njoka said the council decided to accommodate the KMTC in September 2015 because no other venue could be found.	Ogaye mar tat somo mar kar tiegruok e weche mag thieth Ngire Erastus Njoka ne owacho ni buchgi ne oyie rwako jo KMTC e dwe mar ochiko2015 nikech onge kama chielo ma ne oyud ma ne ginyalo dhiye.
“We talked with the university council and agreed to give the building to KMTC since 2015 because they had nowhere to go. Because there is a construction of a library where the primary school was, we have decided they share (the KMTC complex),” said Prof Njoka.	"Profesa Njoka ne owacho kama, ""Ne wawuoyo gi bura mar yunivasiti ma wawinjore miyo KMTC ot ma gibetie e higa mar 2015 nikech ne gionge gi kama digi dhiye. Nikech kama skund praimar chon ne nitie sani nitie laibrari moger kanyo, wawinjore mondo giriwre kanyachiel kuno (kar tiegruok mogajore mar weche thith)."""
However, Njoka called for a speedy construction of the KMTC college at Chuka Hospital, saying it had taken long.	Kata kamano, Njoka ne okwayo joma gero KMTC e osiptal mar Chuka mondo gikas lwetgi nikech koro ndalo osegwaro.
He asked the county government to ensure that the KMTC college campus at the Chuka hospital on the fringes of Chuka town was completed quickly.	Ne okwayo sirkand kaonti mondo one ni gedo mar KMTC e osiptand Chuka orumo mapiyo.
“It has been six years and the project is not complete. We are asking the government to work faster and finish the project, after which we will assess it before releasing the students,” said Njoka.	"Njoka ne owacho kama, ""Koro osekawo higni auchiel to ema projektno pok otieki. Wakwayo sirkal mondo otim tijno mapiyo orum, kae to bang'e wabiro nono kaka otiye ka pok wagonyo jopuonjre."""
He assured parents and other stakeholders that the university, which offers nursing and other medical courses, will continue to support the KMTC.	Ne onyiso jonyuol kod jomamoko ma otudore gi yunivasiti, ma tiego ji bedo nas kod kos moko mag thieth, biro dhi nyime siro KMTC.
“We have first class laboratories and other facilities which KMTC students can make use of, as they further their education,” he said.	"Nowacho kama, ""Wan gi lab ma olos e rang'iny mamalo kod ute mamoko ma jopuonjre mag KMTC nyalo tiyogo sama pod gin kae mondo gisom."""
Ndagani Primary School Headteacher Joseph Keah said sharing the building with KMTC had given the pupils an ideal place to learn.	Japuonj maduong' mar Ndagani Primary School, Joseph Keah, nowacho ni riwo odno gi KMTC osemiyo nyithindo kama ber ahinya mar somo.
“We thank the university for giving the pupils a conducive environment to learn, and the local community is very happy,” said Keah.	"Keah nowacho kama, ""Wagoyo erokamano ne yunivasiti kuom miyo nyithi skul alwora mowinjore gi somo, to bende jogweng' mor sidang'."""
The Covid-19 pandemic exposed Kenya’s unpreparedness for virtual and remote learning due to the unavailability of electronic learning infrastructure.	Covid-19 omiyo ofwenyore ni Kenya ok oikore ne somo ma ji timo ka gin e utegi nikech onge gik moselos ma inyalo tigo e timo kamano.
A report, Impacts of Covid-19 on Adolescents in Kenya, indicates that despite the government’s push to integrate technology in education, Kenya still lags behind in the digital divide.	Ripot ma ne wuoyo e wi Pek ma Rowere yudo nikech Covid-19 e piny Kenya, ne owacho ni kata obedo ni sirkal temo jiwo ahinya tiyo gi teknoloji e somo, Jokenya mang'eny onge gi gige dijitol.
The report focused on the impacts of the pandemic on adolescents in Nairobi, Kisumu, Kilifi and Wajir counties, where students between ages 15 and 19 explained their emote learning experiences.	Ripodno ne wuoyo ahinya e wi chandruoge ma covid osekole ne rowere ma nitie e kaonti mar Nairobi, Kisumu, Kilifi kod Wajir, kama jopuonjre ma hikgi nie kind 15 nyaka 19 ne owacho kaka gisomo ka gin e udi.
Although the education system was unprepared for the massive changes in learning models, a few months into the pandemic, many learning institutions adapted and leveraged remote and online learning options through the internet, television and radio.	Kata obedo ni chenro mar somo ne ok ikore ne lokruoge madongo ma otimore e yore mag somo, e dweche matin ka ne tuo obiro, kuonde tiegruok mang'eny ne osechako tiyo gi yore mag somo e udi kokalo kuom mbuyi, tv kod redio.
Majority of the learners interviewed reported not to have participated in the virtual classes and instead resorted to reading any materials available at home.	Thoth jopuonjre ma ne owuogo ne owacho ni ok gisom e yor intanet, kar mano gisomo buge ma gin go pacho.
“Only one per cent of learners had access to computers during the pandemic, highlighting the significant digital divide in education in the country,” read the report.	"Ripodno ne owacho kama, ""Pasent achiel kende mar jopuonjre ema nigi nyalo mar yudo kompyuto e kinde tuo mokwako piny, to mano nyiso kaka ji mang'eny e piny ok nyal tiyo gi yore mag dijitol e somo."""
Although some teachers relied on mobile phones to send assignments to students and receive answers as text, the medium was very limited.	Kata obedo ni jopuonje moko ne tiyo gi simo e oro ne jopuonjre tije ma ginyalo timo kae giyudo dwoko, yorno ne monogi timo gik mang'eny.
Less than a third of students were able to use mobile phones for learning. 	Jopuonjre matinne ne achiel kuom adek ema ne nyalo tiyo gi simo e somo.
Some schools and teachers in marginalised areas were completely unable to offer any virtual or digital lessons. 	Skunde kod jopuonje moko manie gwenge mosokore ne ok nyal puonjo ka gitiyo gi yore dijitol.
This was evident in Wajir County, where the learners were left to study on their own without any interaction with teachers.	Mano ne onenore ayanga e kaonti mar Wajir kama jopuonjre mang'eny ne owe aweya mondo osom kendgi ma ok gitudre gi jopuonj.
In Nairobi, only 32 per cent of adolescents had access to mobile phones.	E Nairobi, pasent 32 mag rowere ne nyalo somo gi simo.
In Kisumu, there was only 25 per cent, while Kilifi and Wajir recorded the lowest number of learners who had access to materials from schools through phones at 12 and 2 per cent respectively.	E Kisumu ne en pasent 25, to e Kilifi kod Wajir ema kwan mar joma ne nyalo yudo gige somo e simo ne tinie mogik ka gin pasent 12 kod 2 moluwore kamano.
Lack of internet penetration and electricity worsened the plight of learners in rural areas, who attempted to access lessons through radio and television, while others completely ran out of digital options.	Jopuonjre ma odak e gwenge mag risaf ka ma onge intanet kod stima ne ochandore somo gi redio kata tv, to jomoko ne onge gi yore mag dijitol chuth chuth.
“When schools were closed, we were supposed to study through the radio, but we don’t have one,” said a 17-year-old boy from Makueni.	"Rawera moro ma jahigni 17 ma wuok Makueni nowacho kama, ""Ka ne olor skul, ne onego wasom gi redio, kata kamano, waonge kata mana redio."""
About 53 per cent of the learners in the four counties reported not participating in virtual lessons due to lack of electricity, while 40 per cent stated that lack of data bundles hindered them from accessing lessons through smartphones and other devices.	Chiegni pasent 53 mar jopuonjre e kaonti ang'wen-go nowach ni ok nyal somo gi yore dijitol nikech gionge stima, to pasent 40 nowacho ni gionge gi pesa miketo e simo mondo gisomgo.
“Lower-income households were more affected since they rely more on accessing the internet through the more expensive data bundles, while higher-income households use Wi-Fi services, which are cheaper than mobile data bundles,” reads the report.	"Ripodno nowacho kama, ""Ute ma nigi yuto matin ema nohinyore ahinya nikech nikech gitiyo gi bundles e donjo e intanet, to ute ma yuto margi ni malo tiyo gi Wi-Fi ma nengone yot kopim gi bundles."""
The report, however, indicates that initiatives by the government to address the digital divide through DigiTruck Initiative will enable rural youth to obtain digital skills.	Kata kamano, ripodno nonyiso ni nitie okenge ma sirkal okawo mondo ji mang'eny obed jodijitol kokalo kuom DigiTruck Initiative ma biro konyo rowere manie risaf mondo obed gi lony mag dijitol.
The DigiTruck is a solar-powered mobile classroom equipped with internet and smart devices and offers training through a 20 to 40-hour course on the use of computers and smartphones to enable young people to study and find jobs online.	DigiTruck en klas matiyo gi sola manyalo bet kamoro amora kendo en gi intanet gi gige teknoloji mamoko to gichiwo kos makawo seche 20 nyaka 40 e wi tiyo gi kompyuta kod simbe migwelo mondo okony rowere e somo kod yudo tije mitimo e mbuyi.
To date, the initiative has trained more than 1,500 youth in 13 locations in eight counties.	Nyaka chop kawuono, kwan mag joma osetieg gi DigiTruck en rowere mokalo 1,500 e alwora 13 mayudore e kaonti aboro.
Overall, the findings demonstrated that most learners were not able to fully engage in remote learning due to a range of reasons, including lack of access to digital devices and internet connectivity, competing for demands on their time, and the lack of a conducive environment to study.	E wi mago duto, ne oyudore ni thoth jopuonjre ok nyal somo e utegi nikech weche mopogore opogore, moriwo bedo maonge gi masinde mag dijitol kod intanet, bedo maonge sa, kod bedo maonge gi alwora mowinjore ne somo.
At the same time, the report displayed gender disparity in remote learning where girls majorly bore the impact of the challenges faced in remote learning raging from the availability of learning devices to disruptions subjected to learners.	Bende, ripodno ne onyiso pogruok malach mantie e kind nyiri gi yawuoyi ma somo e utegi ka wachore ni nyiri ema romo gi chandruoge mang'eny sama gisomo e udi kaka bedo maonge gi masinde mag somo kendo ichochogi sa ka sa ka gisomo.
While boys reported having owned mobile phones, girls relied on devices lent to them by friends or parents to attend online classes.	Yawuoyi nigi simbegi to thoth joma nyiri chuno ni okwa osiepegi kata jonyuol simo eka gidonj e klas mitiyo gi intanet.
In some cases, mobile phones were used together with other siblings, parents, or guardians. 	To kuonde moko, simbego itiyogo kanyachiel gi nyithindo mamoko kod jonyuol kata ng'at ma gidakgo.
Some reported having had limited access to phones as parents were concerned they would use them to communicate with the opposite gender.	Jomoko ne owacho ni ok ginyal yudo simo nikech jonyuol ne oluor ni ginyalo tiyo gi simbego e tudruok gi yawuoyi.
In Kisumu, 72 per cent of the girls who participated in the study said they resorted to reading books irrelevant to schoolwork while their male colleagues were using mobile phones and computers to study and do assignments.	E Kisumu, ata malo 72 mag nyiri ma ne otigo e nonrono ne owacho ni ne gichako somo buge ma otudore gi gik ma ipuonjogi e skul ka komachielo to yawuoyi ma gisomogo to ne tiyo gi simo kod kompyuta e somo kod timo tich ma jopuonj ochiwo.
The statistics were however different in Nairobi where more girls reported using mobile phones to access online learning materials.	Kata kamano, kwan nopogore Nairobi kama noyudore ni nyiri mang'eny tiyo gi simo e somo.
More adolescent boys than girls returned to school when they reopened in January this year.	Yawuoyi mang'eny mathiewo moloyo nyiri ne oduogo skul kane ji oyepo e dwe mar achiel higani.
According to a government report, young learners could not wait to go back to school as it brought a sense of hope and normalcy.	Kaluwore gi ripot moro mar sirkal, jopuonjre ma rowere ne nigi siso mar dok skul nikech mano ne miyogi geno kendo miyo gineno ka gima onge gima olokore.
On the reporting rate, 84 per cent of girls and 92 per cent of boys re-enrolled.	Kwan mag joma oduogo skul ka ne ji oyepo ne pasent 84 kuom nyiri to pasent 92 ne yawuoyi.
Even though the number looks high, the report said there is still a significant number of learners who did not re-enroll.	Kata obedo ni kwan-go nenore ni en malo, ripot nyiso pod nitie kwan maduong' mar jopuonjre ma ne ok oyawo skul.
Some of the reasons for not re-enrolling were lack of school fees, pregnancies, and availability of work opportunities.	Moko kuom gik momiyo ne ok giyepo en koso pesa midwaro e skul, mako ich, kod yudo tich ma ginyalo tiyo.
“Based on the projections from the 2019 census, the study estimated that 270,350 girls and 137,113 boys who were in school in March 2020 had not returned by February 2021,” said the report.	"""Kaluwore gi milieko mag kweno mar mar oganda 2019, nonrono ne nyiso ni nyiri 270,350 kod yawuoyi 137,113 ma ne nie skul e dwe mar adek 2020 ne ok oduogo skul e dwe mar Ariyo 2021."""
Lack of school fees was cited as the major reason among 47 per cent of girls and 21 per cent of boys who did not return to school. 	Nowach ni gima duong' ma ne omiyo ata malo 47 mar nyiri kod ata malo21 mag yawuoyi ok oduogo skul, en nikech gionge pesa midwaro e skul.
Other key reasons why girls did not return to school were pregnancy (10 per cent) and 5 per cent of the adolescents failed to report to school because they had been married off.	Gik mamoko ma ne miyo nyiri ok oduogo skul en nikech gimako ich (pasent 10) to pasent 5 ne oyepo nikech ne okendgi.
There were others, especially those in Wajir, who felt there was no point to go back to school after a long stay home.	Nitie jomoko, ahinya ahinya modak Wajir, mane wacho ni onge tiende gidog e skul bang' bet ot kuom ndalo mogwaro ahinya.
Amongst adolescent boys, the exposure to job opportunities during the pandemic made most of them wish to pursue their jobs and dump school.	To kuom yawuoyi, yudo tije ma ginyalo tiyo e kinde tuo mar corona ne omiyo gibedo gi gombo mar dhi nyime gi tich to giweyo skul.
Majority of the students (94 per cent) went back to the same school they were in.	Thoth jopuonjre (pasent 94) ne odok e skunde ma yande gintie.
Those who switched schools highlighted affordability and lack of school fees as the reason why their parents opted to move them.	Joma ne owilo skunde nowacho ni gitimo kamano nikech nengo mogonyore kae to jonyuol ne onge pesa moromo omiyo ne gidarogi.
The pandemic is believed to have been a major contributor to low grades recorded in the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Examination results released in May this year. 	Wachore ni tuo mar corona ema omiyo ji ne orem e penj mar KCSE ma ne oland dwoko mare e dwe mar Mei higani.
Only 20 per cent of the students attained grades high enough to gain entrance to universities. 	Pasent 20 kende mag jopuonjre ema noyudo alama manyalo terogi e yunivasiti.
It also drew concern over the high number of learners who returned to school pregnant band those that did their exams in maternity wards.	Bende mano ne omiyo ochako parore nikech kwan maduong' mar jopuonjre mane oduogo skul ka gin gi ich kod joma notimo penj ka gin e osiptal mar joma nyuol.
“The low performance can be attributed to limited learning during the school closures, lower self-esteem, among other reasons,” said the report.	"Ripodno nowacho ni, ""Nyalo bedo ni ji ne orem e penj nikech ne gionge thuolo moromo mar somo nikech nolor skunde, gichayore giwegi kod weche mamoko."""
The Ministry of Education reported that 652 girls sat for the examination in hospital, which is 131 per cent higher than the 282 girls in 2019. 	Migawo mar Somo ne owacho ni nyiri 652 ne otimo penj ka gin e osiptal, to mano oloyo kwan mar higa 2019 gi pasent 131 ma ne nyiri 282.

Lecturers from all public universities have come up with new demands that will be part of their next Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).	Jopuonje mag mbalariany duto okelo ywak manyien ma gidhi keto winjruok margi maluwo mar Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
Under their umbrella body, University Academic Staff Union (Uasu), the dons have decried unfair treatment by the government as compared to other employees in public sectors. 	Kokalo kuom riwruok margi mar UASU, giseywagore ni sirkal ok timnegi maber kopim gi jotich mamoko ma sirkal ondiko.
UASU secretary-general Constantine Wasonga said that in his second term, he shall focus on bridging the inequalities that public university dons face. 	Jagoro maduong' mar UASU, Constantine Wasonga nowacho ni e tam mare mar ariyo, obiro keto pache e tieko chandruoge ma joma tiyo e mbalariany romogo.
“I have been re-elected alongside a very able team and our message to Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) is simple-We shall negotiate. Article 230 of the Constitution is not superior to Article 41,” said Wasonga. 	"Wasonga ne owacho kama, ""Oyiero kendo to atiyo kanyachiel gi tim motegno kendo dwaher nyiso Migawo mar Osara kod Chudo ni wadhi twak kodgi. Chik mar Sula 230 ok duong' moloyo Sula 41."""
The SG noted that the promotion of lecturers had been left to individual universities which are never in a hurry to do so, thereby limiting their career growth and demotivating them. 	Jagorono ne owacho ni nitie mbalariany matin kende ma omedie jopuonje ngas, to mano en gima nyoso chunygi kendo miyo ok gitim dongruok.
“Parliament appropriates money for the promotion of public sector employees. There has never been an appropriation to cater for promotions of dons.	"Nodhi nyime ni, ""Od Bura oketo tenge pesa monego tigo e medo ngas jotich mag sirkal. Pok oketga tenge omenda minyalo tigo e medo ngas jopuonje mag mbalariany."""
"""We shall demand that our promotions are done at equal footing with other government employees across all public universities,"" said Wasonga. "	"Wasonga medo ni, ""Wakwayo matek ni wan be omedwa ngas mana jotich mamoko mag sirkal e mbalariany duto mag sirkal."""
He explained that despite training professionals now in leadership positions, they have been denied proper health insurance covers which other government officials enjoy. 	Nowacho ni kata obedo ni gitiego jomoko mondo obed gi tije madongo, pok omigi pesa ma nyalo konyogi sama gituo kaka mimiyo jotich mamoko ma sirkal ondiko tich.
“We shall be demanding a non-contributory medical scheme for all lecturers. We want to be treated as other civil servants. We are serving the same government in a critical sector,” said Wasonga. 	"Wasonga ne owacho kama, ""Wadwaro mondo sirkal ochulnwa chenro mar yudo thieth ne jopuonj duto mag mbalariany. Wadwaro ni otimnwa kaka jotich mamoko mag sirkal. Waduto watiyo ne sirkal achiel e tich ma ok yot."""
He added that lecturers have been working in an undefined environment for which they are not satisfactorily compensated for their services. 	Nowacho ni jopuonje mag mbalariany tiyo e alwora ma ok owinjore to migi chudo mowinjore gi tich ma gitimo.
“Every teacher in primary school knows their workload. This is not the case for us. In public universities, some lecturers teach units, evening classes, online, in-person. If they want us to teach, they will have to pay us overtime,” he said. 	"Nowacho ni, ""Jopuonje duto e skunde praimar ong'eyo ni tich monego gitim romo nade. Wan to chal marwa opogore.

He added that dons are also discriminated against on car loans which other civil servants enjoy under established schemes.	Ne owacho ni jopuonje mag mbalariany ibuono nikech ok oyienegi ng'iewo geche ma ichulo mos mos kaka jotich sirkal moko nigi chenro ma konyo e wachno.

Recommendations of the Building Bridges Initiative Steering Committee that examinable set books in high schools should be locally written and capture local issues has triggered debate in the education sector.  	Komiti machwalo BBI ne okwayo mondo buge sigendni mitiyogo e skunde sekondar obed mondik gi Jokenya kendo giwuo mana e weche mamulo jopiny to parono ne okelo mbaka mager kuom josomo.
In their proposals, the team suggested that all set books should be by local authors and with content relating to Kenyan life. 	E kwayo margi, timno ne owacho ni gidwaro mondo buge duto mag sigendni mitiyogo obed mondik gi jondiko ma Jokenya kendo giwuo mana e weche mamulo ngima Jokenya.
It specifically cites the works of leading Kenyan author Ngugi Wa Thiong’o, saying his works should heavily feature in the set books.	Ne giwuoyo kuom buge moko mondik gi jandiko mong'ere Kenya, Ngugi wa Thiong'o ka giwacho ni thoth bugene ema onego otigo.
The committee also proposed that all books are written in English be translated into vernacular, to encourage children to take an interest in local languages and develop multi-lingual children.	Komitino ne okwayo mondo buge duto mondik gi Kisungu olok e dhok ma ji wacho, to mano dhi konyo nyithindo mondo opuonjre dhok mopogore ma ji wacho.
The recommendations are noble. 	Kwayo mekgigo gin mowinjore.
And they will obligate the Ministry of Education to expose students to more works of literature by Kenyan writers than before.	Gidhi miyo Migawo mar Somo oket jopuonjre mondo osom buge mang'eny mondik gi Jokenya moloyo kinde moro amora.
Literary works are embedded in English, which comprises the study of English as a language and the study of Literature in English.	Somo buge mag Kisungu oriwo puonjore dho Kisungu kod somo buge sigendni mag Kisungu.
However, the study of the Literature component is confined to only a few books in high school.	Kata kamano, nitie mana buge manok mitiyogo somo mar buge e skunde sekondar.
In secondary schools, the syllabus requires that learners engage in critical analysis of the prescribed textbooks which include a novel, a play and an anthology of short stories.	E skunde sekondar, chenro mar somo dwaro ni jopuonjre osom kendo onon matut buge moyier ma oriwo bug sigana ma rarieya, buk moting'o mbaka kod moting'o sigendni machieko.

Outside these set books, the Ministry of Education has—regrettably—not spelled out books students should be exposed to as part of their exposure to the literary heritage of mankind and Kenya in particular.	Gima lit en ni e bugego duto, Migawo mar Somo ok oyudo buge ma nyalo miyo jopuonjre mondo ong'e nond dhano to ahinya ahinya nond Kenya.
English as a subject in Primary and secondary school is inordinately focused on Grammar, Comprehension and Composition.	Somo mar Kisungu mipuonjo e skunde praimar kod sekondar odich ahinya gi konyo ji ng'eyo kaka iwacho dhokno kod kaka onego owinje.
There is no formal study of or exposure of learners to standard genres of Literature in English –prose and poetry, plays and the novel—in primary schools under the 8–4–4 system of education.	Onge yo malong'o ma ipuonjogo jopuonjre gik madongo e buge sigendni mag Kisungu—ma gin shairi kod wende, twak kod sigendni mabocho— e chenro mar somo mar 8–4–4.
The same applies to High School English. Study of examinable set books starts in Form Three.	To mano be e gima timore gi Kisungu mipuonjo e sekondar. Penj mag buge sigendni ichako kel mana e Form 3.
KICD has not outlined what books students in Forms One and Form Two should read—leaving many schools and teachers without guidance and compulsion to teach literary texts to students.	KICD pok owacho buge ma jo Form 1 kod 2 onego osom to mano miyo skunde mang'eny kod jopuonje bedo ma ok gipuonj bugego ne jopuonjre.
The study of English in all its facets—as a language and as a vehicle of culture–is supposed to among others, build to help students comprehend the meaning that the author tries to convey in order to enhance their reading ability.	Puonjruok Kisungu kod kondege te, kaka dhok kod gima puonjo ji timbe oganda, onego obed gima konyo jopuonjre ng'eyo gima jandiko temo losoe to mano onego otieg nyalogi mar somo.
Also supposed to enhance students' critical thinking and judgmental abilities develop students' writing ability by writing an essay or comments related to the topic of the literature.

It should ideally help students to develop speaking fluency in English by asking questions and sharing their feedback during discussion of a piece of work they are reading or have read as part of their extensive reading.	Chutho chutho onego okony jopuonjre wacho Kisungu malolore kuom penjo kod chiwo paro sama ji wuoyo ka ginono gima gisomo kanyachiel kata gima ne gisomo kendgi.
This should ideally happen right from class four when the learners have learned how to read all the way to Form Four.	To ka ber, mano en gima onego ochak timore e klas ang'wen kama jopuonjore oseng'eyo somo ma gidhi adhiya nyaka e klas apar gariyo.
This is how an education system can use English to cultivate the nurture the competences human beings need to survive in a complex world we now face.	Mano e yo ma chenro mar somo nyalo tiyo gi Kisungu e nyago kido moko kuom dhano mondo okonygi dhach e ndalo matek mwadakiegi.
The government, through the Ministry of Education, will have to radically review the English curriculum/syllabus to ensure that student’s basic education institutions are exposed to more materials of outstanding literary merit than the three or four books they study.	Sirkal, kokalo kuom Migawo mar Somo, biro dwaro ni olok silabas mar Kisungu mondo jopuonjre obed gi buge momedore ma ginyalo somo mopogore gi buge sigendni adek kata ang'wen ma gisomo sani.
Some observations: Confining students to examinable set books has little or no educational basis whatsoever.	Moko kuom weche mosene: Keto jopuonjre mondo osomo buge sigendni ma idhi kel e penj kony matin kata samoro onge gima konyo kata matin e weche somo.
It inspires students to empathise with others, to find their own voice as they reflect on the human condition with discernment, and to consider the impact of their beliefs and actions on society.	Gijiwo jopuonjre mondo one lit ne jomoko, gichiw pachgi e wi gik ma gineno ka timore, to bende ginon kaka paro ma gin go kod timbegi mulo oganda.
The Basic Curriculum Framework—which is the blue print of Competence-Based Curriculum (CBC) notes that the study of Literature in English, should help students, develop “the capacity for critical thinking, personal growth and empathy, enhanced appreciation of diversity in human nature and culture.”	"Silabas ma bende winjore gi CBC (Competence-Based Curriculum) wacho ni somo buge sigendi e Kisungu onego okony jopuonjre mondo ""pachgi oyawre, gitim dongruok e ngimagi kendo gine ne ji lit, girwak paro mopogore opogore ma dhano kod ogendni nigo."""
Restricting learners to local authors negates this. 	Chuno jopuonjre ni osomo mana buge mondik gi Jokenya ok winjre gi parono.
The framework for teaching humanities and social science disciplines requires that students start from the known to the unknown.	Yo ma ipuonjogo somo ma nono ngima dhano kod sayans mag dak, dwaro ni jopuonjre ochak gi gima ging'eyo komondi kae to gidhi e gima gikiya.
They should start with an understanding of Kenya from local to global, to be expanded to East Africa, Africa and the world.	Onego gichak gi ng'eyo Kenya maber e gidhi e piny mangima, kochakore gi East Africa, kae to Afrika kae to piny duto.
The Education the Basic Education Curriculum Framework we have referred to envision an education not just of imparting or cultivating skills. Rather, an education that is imbued with values.	Somo e silabas ma osewach motelocha ok dwar mana miyo jopuonjre lony. Kar mano, gidwaro ni ji onyag kido mabeyo.
“The teaching and learning of values will also enable them to value diversity in all people, and to demonstrate respect, empathy and compassion for all people,” it notes.	"Owacho kama, ""Puonjo ji nyago kido mabeyo biro konyogi rwako ji duto mopogore kodgi, gichiw luor, gine lit ne ji kendo gibed mang'won gi ji duto."""
The “demonstration of respect, empathy and compassion for all people” refers all people, regardless of ethnicity, and nationality and race.	"Nyiso ""luor, neno lit ne ji kog bedo mang'won gi ji duto"" oriwo ji duto bed ni giwuok e dhoot mane, piny mane kata pien dendgi chalo nade."
Students can only develop global awareness through exposure to literary texts that include not just local authors but also authors outside Kenya.	Jopuonjore nyalo ng'eyo gik matimore e piny mangima ka gisomo buge mondik gi jondiko ma a oko to ok mana Jokenya kende.
The Uganda National Examinations Board (UNEB) recommendations of examinable textbooks for its secondary school students are noble in vision.	Paro ma ne ochiw gi Uganda National Examinations Board (UNEB) e wi buge ma onego osom e skunde sekondar en paro maliw.
It has enabled students not only to study literary texts by Ugandan authors, but also authors from Kenya, West Africa, South Africa, American, English authors and those from Continental Europe.	Giyiene jopuonjre mondo osom buge sigendni mondik gi Jo Uganda, Jokenya, Jo West Africa, South Africa, Amerka, UK kod jondiko ma wuok Europe.
You can easily see insularity in our choice of examinable literary texts.	Inyalo fwenyo mapiyo kaka buge mawayiero ma ikelo e penj ok oyier maber.
The Recommendation to restrict examinable books to Kenyan will exacerbate the narrow-mindedness even further. It should not happen.	Kwayo mar ni buge mitiyogo obed mana mondik gi Jokenya en paro mabiro dino pachgi. Mano gima ok onego timre.
The other danger of restricting examinable books to Kenyan authors is that the Ministry of Education might be forced to recommend books of dubious literary merit for study in our schools.	Rach machielo manyalo betie ka owach ni itiyo mana gi buge Jokenya kende, en ni Migawo mar Somo nyalo pwodho mondo ji oti gi buge sigendi mondik gi joma wuondore.
We shouldn’t force students to study books because our compatriots have written them.	Ok onego wachun nyithindo gi somo buge mana nikech Jokenya wetegi ema ondiko bugego.
The books should be of high literary value in terms language, imagination and creativity, in terms of moral and cultural vision and also of values.	Buge misomo onego obed manie rang'iny mamalo kodok korka dhok, paro manie buk, timbe kod kido moko mabeyo ma ijiwo e bugno.
These books should make students to think deeply about life and all its imperfections and possibilities.	Bugego onego omi jopuonjre paro matut kuom ngima kod nyawo gi gik manyalo timore e ngima ng'ato.
The Basic Education Curriculum Framework lists seven core competencies that should be to be achieved by every learner in basic education.	Silabas kwano gik moko abiriyo ma jopuonjre duto onego obedgo sama gitieko yudo somo mochuno.
They are communication and Collaboration, self-efficacy, Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, Creativity and Imagination, Citizenship, Digital Literacy, and Learning to Learn.	Gigo gin tudruok kod tiyo kanyachiel gi jomoko, dongruok mar ng'ato owuon, paro mochwiny kod ng'eyo loso wach, paro moyawore kendo matut, hero piny, ng'eyo weche dijitol, kod bedo ng'at moikore puonjore.
Confining students to local literary texts will not only undermine the achievement of these competences, it will also restrict the opportunities that exist for them beyond the boundaries of Kenya.	Gigo ok bi timore po nono ni oket jopuonjre mondo osom mana buge Jokenya kende, to bende mano biro mayogi thuolo mar gik ma dine gitimo oko mar Kenya.
The government should broaden the study of English beyond grammar, Comprehension, and composition to include more reading matter of great literary materials—both fictional and nonfictional materials.	Sirkal onego oyar tong' mar gik misomo e Kisungu mondo kik gibed mana grama, winjo dhok kod ndiko kende, to bende mondo giriw somo momedore mag buge sigendi, gibed mochuogi kod motimore adier.
We should begin to see class learners in Grade four to Grade 12, getting exposed to folk literature not just of Kenya, but Africa, and the rest of the world.	Joma nie ondamo mar Gred 4 nyaka Gred 12 onego chak somo buge mag  Kenya, Afrika kod piny ngima.
The same should apply to short stories, novels, plays, poetry, essays, and speeches.	Mano be e gima onego otimre ne sigendni machieko, sigendni machieko, drama, shairi, weche mindiko kod twege.
Nicholas Maiyo, Kenya Parents Association chairman, suggests teachers agree with MoE to approve the extra charges imposed on parents.	Nicholas Maiyo, ma en jakom Riwruok mar Jonyuol, wacho ni jopuonje onego oyiere gi Migao mar somo mondo gipwodh chudo momedore midwaro kuom jonyuol.
The Kenya National Association of Parents has condemned emerging reports of additional fees imposed on parents by secondary school heads ahead of Form One admission on August 2, saying they should follow the right procedure.	Riwruok mar Jonyuol e Kenya okwedo ripode mag omenda ma omedore mag somo ma oluow gi jotend skunde kuom jonyuol motelo ne rweko mag jo klas ochiko tarik 2 dwe mar aboro, kendo siemogi ni gilure gi chenro mowinjore.
These sentiments come after a report by The Standard established most schools were asking Form One parents to pay between Sh5,000 and Sh35,000 ‘development fees’ before being issued with admission letters.	Wechegi ne biro bang' ka The Standard yango duoko mar nonro moro ma wacho ni sikunde mathoth kwayo jonyul mag jo kilas ochiko kod mondo ochul omenda ma e kind siling' 5,000 nyaka 35,000 miluongo kaka dongruok ka pok omigi oboke mar rwakogi  skul.
The school heads had earlier argued that the ministry’s funding was not enough to improve schools’ infrastructure, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.	Jotend skunde ne oseywagore motelo, ni omenda ma migao mar somo miyogi ok oromo duso gige sikul, ahinya to e kinde mag Covid-19.
Some, though not on record, said the extra money was to build more classes and dormitories for the learner’s comfort.	Moko, ma ne ok oketi e andiko, ne owacho ni omenda momedorego onego ti go e medo ute somo kod ute nindo ne jopuonjre.
In an interview with KTN News on Monday morning, Nicholas Maiyo, chair of the Parents’ Association urged school principals to ask for approval from the Ministry of Education concerning the additional levy.	Ka ne idayo dhoge gi od weche manyien mar KTN chieng' Wuok Tich okinyi, Nicholas Maiyo, ma en jakom Riwruok mar Jonyuol  ne ojiwo jotend skunde mondo gikwa thuolo ir Migawo mar Somo kuom chudo ma omedore go.
“I am surprised to hear parents are paying for admission. Why? Parents should only feed students and provide personal effects,” he told KTN News.	" ""Abwok ahinya winjo ni jonyuol chulo pesa mirwakogo nyathi e skul. Ang'o momiyo? Jonyuol onego pidh mana nyithindo kod gik madwarore mag ng'ato owuon,"" ne onyiso od fwambo mar weche manyien mar KTN,"
“We (parents) will not pay money that cannot be audited. Any money paid to schools and is not recognised by the Ministry of Education will automatically not be audited. That is a loophole for graft,” he said.	" ""Wan (jonyuol) ok bi chulo omenda ma ok nyal non ni otiyo nade. Omenda moro amora mochul e skul ma ok oyangi gi Migao mar Somo, chutho ok bi non ni gitiyo nade. Mano en obadho mar mibadhi,"" ne owacho."
Maiyo challenged school heads to discuss challenges (classrooms and dormitories) openly with the ministry and chart a way forward.	Maiyo ne oseyo jotend skunde mondo giwuo gi Migao mar Somo e wi pek ma giromogo (ute somo kod ute nindo) ayanga kendo gi go mbaka kaka e yo ma onego gi dhi go nyime.
The principals need to sit down in their unions and come up with an MOA that will see the ministry approve the so-called ‘development fee’. 	Jotend skul onego obed piny e riwruok margi kae to gilos ogirimiti mar winjruok mobiro konyo Migawo mar Somo pwodho gima giluongo ni 'pes dongruok'.
It is only then that we can agree on the way forward because this way, we are hurting the parents.	Mano eka wanyalo sudo nikech gima timore sani hinyo jonyuol.
In a recent interview, Education Permanent Secretary Julius Jwan said any charge levied on parents without the ministry’s approval is illegal and asked parents to stop making such payments.	Ka ne jowambo gi keyo dayo dhoge e kinde machiegni mokalo, Jagoro mongirore mar Somo, Julius Jwan ni chudo moro amora ma mbalang' ma iketo e wi jonyuol ka ok oyangi gi mogao en mani e tok chik kendo jonyuol ok onego chul chudo ma kamano.
“The guidelines are clear on what schools’ management boards should do when they want to raise any additional money therefore, we cannot leave it open for all schools to charge extra levies,” said Jwan.	"Jwan ne owacho kama, ""Chike nyiso maler gima bod mag skunde onego otim ka gidwaro pesa momedore. Ok wanyal weyo aweyo mondo skunde okwa pesa kaka gidwaro."""
While pushing for fee increment in 2019, principals pointed an accusing finger towards the government saying it does not fund five key maintenance items in the running of a school.	Ka gidwaro mondo omed pes skul e higa mar 2019, jotend skunde nowacho ni sirkal ok chiw pesa madwarore e timo gik moko abich madongo madwarore e skul.
They said fumigation as a result of Covid-19, window maintenance, kitchen and laboratory maintenance, building repair and maintenance have not been funded.	Ne giwacho ni kuoyo yath e skul nikech Covid-19, loso dirisni, loso jokon kod od pimo, gedo kod rito kuonde mokethore pok ochul.

Chief Executive Officer of the Commissioner of University Education (CUE) Mwenda Ntarangwi	Jata tije maduong' mar Kamisen mar somo mag Mbalariany, Mwenda Ntarangwi
The tussle over accrediting of University programmes has continued as it emerged some professional bodies are still pushing to have the responsibility to approve academic courses.	Lweny mar pwodho gik mipuonjo e mbalariany pod dhi nyime sama riwruoge moko osieko ma dwaro mondo omigi ting' mar pwodho kos mipuonjo.
This is despite a court ruling, in June last year, that handed that responsibility to the Commission for University Education (CUE). 	Mano timore kata obedo ni Jun higa mokalo, doho nong'ado ni mano en ting' ma owe ne Kamisen mar somo mag Mbalariany.
Court of Appeal judges Mohammed Warsame, Daniel Musinga and Fatuma Sichale ruled that CUE is the only body mandated to regulate standards and accredit courses, in consultation with individual universities.	Jong'ad bura e doho mar apil, Mohammed Warsame, Daniel Musinga kod Fatuma Sichale nong'ado ni Kamisen mar somo mag Mbalariany. e bura ma oyiene keto rang'iny mag kos ka gitudore gi mbalariany achiel achiel.
“We find no reason to suspend the commission’s mandate in regulating and accrediting courses as provided in the Universities Act. The application filed by the professional associations has no merit and we dismiss it accordingly,” ruled the judges.	"Jong'ad burago ne owacho kama, ""Onge wach ma wayudo ma dimi wama burano ting' mar keto rang'iny mag kos mipuonjo kaka oket e Chik Yunivasiti. Kwayo ma okel gi riwruoge mopogore onge tiende kendo wabolo kwayo margi."""
The Appellate Court’s decision affirmed CUE’s powers in accrediting university courses, bringing to an end a long-running battle between the commission and several professional associations which demanded that they should be given authority to supervise various university courses.	Doho mar apil ne omedo osiro ni Kamisen mar somo mag Mbalariany. ema nigi teko mar keto rang'iny mag kos mipuonjo e mbalariany, to mano nobedo giko ywarruok ma osekawo kinde malach e kind burano kod riwruoge mamoko ma dwaro ni gin be omigi teko e wi kos moko mipuonjo e mbalariany.
It is now emerging that despite this ruling, some professional bodies are still pushing for the right to accredit university courses.	Osefwenyore ni kata mana bang' bura ma ne oseng'ad gi doho, pod nitie riwruoge moko ma kedo mondo omigi teko mar keto rang'iny mag kos mek mbalariany.
It a letter dated June 23, and copied to all vice-chancellors of universities and principals of colleges, CUE Chief Executive Mwenda Ntarangwi cited the breach of court order in the demands by the professional bodies.	E barua ma ne ondik Jun 23, kendo nomi oboke bende ne ogaye mag mbalariany kod jotend kolej, jatend Kamisen mar somo mag Mbalariany, Mwenda Ntarangwi nowacho ni nitie riwruoge moko ma ok luw bura ma ne ong'ad gi doho.
“It has come to the knowledge of the commission that professional bodies continue to purport to accredit or approve academic programmes in universities,” said Ntarangwi.	"Ntarangwi ne owacho ni, ""Burawa osefwenyo ni riwruoge moko pod kedo mondo giket rang'iny kendo pwodho kos moko mayudore e mbalariany."""
In the letter, Ntarangwi says many universities have complained about the professional bodies demands and ahev asked for direction CUE over the matter.	E baruano, Ntarangwi wacho ni mbalariany mang'eny oseywagore ni riwruogego chandogi kendo gikwayo mondo CUE onyisgi gima onego gitim.
“On a sad note, and despite court judgement, some professional bodies continue to engage universities with little regard, if any, to the commission. This is not only contemptuous but disregard to the sub-sector regulator,” he said.	"Nowacho kama, ""En gima lit, ni kata obedo ni doho ne oseyalo wachno, riwruogegi pod dhi nyime donjore gi mbalariany ma ok gidewo burawa. Ma ok en ana gima rach kend, en achaya ne joma omi tich mar nono kaka weche timore."""
And now, Ntarangwi has cautioned VCs not to breach court decision and threatened to withdraw already approved courses or decline any further applications.	Ntarangwi koro sani ne osiemo ogaye mag mbalariany mondo kik gikech chik ma ne doho ogolo kendo ne giwacho ni gidhi golo kos moko mane osepwodh kod kwayo moko be ma ne oseor.
“Any university engaging anybody, as far as the accreditation, licensing and recognition of university education (including accreditation/approval of academic programmes) not within an agreed framework with the commission, the commission will decline to accredit/approve such programmes if the same is yet to be accredited/approved,” said Ntarangwi.	"Ntarangwi ne owacho kama, ""Mbalariany moro amora ma wuoyo gi ng'ato e wi pwotho, yudo lesen kod ng'erruok mar somo ma mbalariany (moriwo keto rang'iny kod pwodho kos) ma ok otim kaluwore gi kaka bura margi dwaro, burano ne dhi tamore pwodho kos kata chenro kaka mago."""
He said if universities continue to engage any other body over courses they have already accredited or approved without due consideration of the commission, then CUE will be forced to withdraw such programmes.	Nowacho ni ka mbalarianygo odhi nyime tudore gi riwruogego e weche kos ma gisepwodho ma ok gifwaro burano, to dhi chuno mondo Kamisen mar somo mag Mbalariany. ogol oko kos kata chenrogo.
He said CUE is, however, ready and willing to work with professional bodies as was advised by the court.	Nowacho ni, Kamisen mar somo mag Mbalariany, kata kamano, oikore tiyo kanyakla gi riwruogego mana kaka ne onyisgi gi doho.
“As much as the commission is open to working with the few professional bodies that have taken this route, universities are hereby notified of consequences of disregarding the court directive and guidance of regulator,” said Ntarangwi.	"""Kata obedo ni Kamisen oyangore mar tiyo kanyakla gi riwruoge matin ma oseyie luwo yor no, kuonde mbalariany imiyo ote ewi rach mar jwang'o siem mar doho kod techo mag ogaye,"" Ntarangwi ne owacho."

The associations had challenged Section 5A of the Universities (Amendment) Act 2016 that stipulates accreditation, recognition, licensing, student indexing and approval of any programme offered at a university shall be a mandate of CUE.	Riwruogego ne okwedo Kidieny mar 5A mar (lokruok) pend chike Mbalariany ma 2016 ma lero yieyo lwedo, yango, lesen, kaka ichiwo kwan jopuonjre kod pwodho chenro moro amora mag mbalariany, biro bedo ting' mar Kamisen mar somo mag Mbalariany.

The study, by the University of Nairobi in collaboration with UN Women, Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), the State Department for Gender (SDfG), and the National Gender and Equality Commission (NGEC), indicates Nyanza leads in the number of adolescents, who have had more than one child.

Teenagers, who did not profess any religious faith are more likely to get pregnant, while those of the Muslim faith had the least cases of repeat teenage pregnancies, according to the study titled: Women’s Empowerment, Health and Gender-Based Violence for Gender Equality Policies.

Repeat teenage pregnancies were more prevalent among those without education.	Nyiri ma rowere ma mako ich mar ariyo thothne ne gin joma ok osomo.
Research findings on sexual violence also show 76 per cent of victims who sought help relied on informal channels, while another 53 per cent neither disclosed the violation nor sought help.

“In most cases, the media, and lately social media, is left to decide, manage, opine and disseminate information on this sensitive subject,” said Ms Verity Mganga, the acting director for Policy and Research at SDfG.	"""Kinde mathoth, jofwambo, to chutho yore keyo weche mag mbuyi mag oganda, ema owe mondo ong'ad wach, tayo,chiwo pach gi, kod keyo wech e wi thor wach ma ok yot wuoyo e ni,"" ne owachi gi nyadendi Verity Mganga, ma en jata tije mar Chike kod Nonro e SDfG."
Fear of repercussions, shame, stigma, and a feeling of helplessness were identified as factors hindering female victims’ from reporting sexual violence.

UN Women country director Anna Mutavati said with availability of data, key areas, such as budget, can be reshaped to cater for areas such as teenage pregnancy and other issues that affect women.

“We decided to partner with the University of Nairobi to empower young researchers to focus on solutions that will fill the existing gender data gap,” Mutavati said during the launch of the report in Nairobi yesterday.	" ""Ne wayiero mondo wariwre gi mbalariany ma Nairobi mondo wateg jotim nonro ma pod tindo ka wachomo wang'wa e dino fuok mar kwan mag ji ka otenore gi kit chuech."""
University of Nairobi vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen Kiama said: “University of Nairobi takes great pride in its role in interpreting our highly technical work into simple yet impactful communication that resonates with diverse users.”  	"Ogaye maduong' mar mbalariany ma Nairobi, Ngire Stephen Kiama ne owacho niya: ""Mbalariany ma Nairobi omor ahinya gi migawo ma gimako mar loko tich mogajore obed gima yot winjo mayot ne ji mopogore opogore ma tiyo gi wechego."""
