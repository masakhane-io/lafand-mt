In the case of Somalia, the biggest threat to the evolution of an effective state has been the United States.	Ekisinze okulemesa eggwanga lya Somalia okutereera ye Amerika
United States involvement in Somalia began with the 1991 intervention that was largely a humanitarian gesture.	Amerika lwe yasooka okuyingira mu nsonga za Somalia mu 1991 okusingira ddala yalina kigendererwa kya kuyamba bantu baali bakoseddwa.
However, when America shifted its mandate from humanitarian intervention to peace enforcement, it got entangled in a war with Mohammed Aideed.	Naye Amerika bwe yava ku kigendererwa ekyo n'eyingira mu nsonga ez'okuzzaawo emirembe, yatandika okulwanagana ne Mohammed Aideed.
This led to the death of eighteen Americans in the famous “black hawk down” battle in Mogadishu that caused a United States withdrawal.	Ekyo kyaviirako Abamerika kkumi na munaana okufiira mu lutalo olwali e Mogadishu, ekyawaliriza Amerika okubiggyamu enta.
Had America allowed Aideed to militarily capture the whole country of Somalia, Somalia would have emerged more stable and effective.	Singa Amerika yaleka Aideed okuwamba ensi ya Somalia yonna, Somalia teyandibaddemu butabanguko bungi era yanditebenkedde.
The American position was reinforced by the international humanitarian groups and their ill-informed and misguided African chorus singers.	Endowooza n'ebiruubirirwa bya Amerika byeyongera okutumbulwa ebibiina ebirwanirira eddembe ly'obuntu n'abayimbi abaali batamanyi byonna bizingirwamu era abaali babuzaabuziddwa.
They looked at that country’s problem from a purely humanitarian perspective and missed the vital importance of effective military control of Somalia.	Baalowooza nnyo ku ddembe ly'obuntu ne babuusa amaaso obukulu bw'okuba n'eggye erikuuma eddembe mu Somalia.
I harbour a fundamental disagreement with democracy and human rights groups in Africa.	Nze ku lwange, sikkiriza nti enkola ya demokulasiya awamu n'ebibiina ebirwanirira eddembe ly'obuntu biyamba Afirika.
Democracy exists in stable and effective states, not in anarchy.	Demokulase ayamba nsi ezatebenkera edda, so si ezo ezikyalimu obusambatukko.
What Somalia needs is a military strongman with  organisational ability to gather resources , bribe and persuade other military and civilian groups together.	Somalia kye yeetaaga ye munnamagye ow'amaanyi alina obusobozi obw'okukumaakuma abantu n'okusendasenda amagye amalala.
In the mid 2000s, the Islamic Courts Union grew and spread rapidly, establishing order over large parts of the country.	Mu makkati g'emyaka gya 2000, ekibiina ky'eby'obufuzi ekiyitibwa Islamic Courts Union kyakula era ne kibuna mu bitundu bingi ebya Somalia, ne kireetawo obutembenkevu mu bitundu bingi eby'eggwanga eryo.
However, post 11th September America was scared of anything Islamic and thus saw the Islamic Courts Union as an enemy.	Naye oluvannyuma lw'ebyo ebyaliwo nga Ssebutemba 11, Amerika yatandika okwekengera ennyo ekintu kyonna ekyalimu Abayisiraamu, bwe kityo ekibiina ekyo yali ekitwala ng'omulabe.
It financed Ethiopia to dislodge them from power.	Yassa ssente mu Esiyopiya esobole okuggyako ekibiina ekyo obuyinza.
From the ashes of their defeat emerged the Al-Shabaab with largely terrorist intentions rather than a desire to build a strong state.	Okugwa kw'ekibiina ekyo kwaviirako ekibiina kya Al-Shabaab okutandikibwawo ng'okusingira ddala kyettanira bikolwa bya bwannalukalala mu kifo ky'okuzimba eggwanga eritebenkedde.
America should have worked with Islamic Courts Union to create a stable state in Somalia.	Amerika yandibadde ekolera wamu n'ekibiina kya Islamic Courts Union okuleetawo obutebenkevu mu Somalia.
United States of America was unwilling to send in troops to hold the peace because it was not politically sellable.	Amerika teyali nneetegefu kusindika magye kukuuma mirembe kubanga bannabyabufuzi mu ggwanga eryo baali tebagyagala.
It subcontracted that role to Uganda and Burundi.	Bw'etyo yasalawo okukozesa Uganda ne Burundi.
Museveni, seeing an opportunity to be central to United States of America's geo-strategic interests in the region offered to send in troops.	Museveni, bwe yakiraba nti yandibadde wa kumwanjo nnyo mu kutuukirizibwa kw'ebigendererwa bya Amerika mu Somalia, yakkiriza okusindika amagye.
I am reluctant to believe that Museveni was driven by a desire for peace in Somalia.	Sikiwa nti ekigendererwa kya Museveni ekikulu kwali kuleetawo mirembe mu Somalia.
Museveni convinced me that such ill advised foreign military interventions despite being well intentioned, tend to create more problems than they solve.	 Museveni yankakasa nti amagye ag'ebweru bwe geeyingiza mu nsonga z'amawanga amalala, ne bwe gaba tegalina bigendererwa bikyamu, emirundi mingi gongera bwongezi kwonoona mbeera.
In 2002, Museveni shared a speech he delivered in Zimbabwe on Uganda and Rwanda’s role in the removal of Mobutu of Zaire.	Mu 2002, Museveni yagabanako n'abalala ku ebyo bye yayogerera mu lukungaana olwali e Zimbabwe olwali lukwata ku ngeri Uganda ne Rwanda gye zaayambako mu kuggya Mobutu owa Zaire mu buyinza.
Somalia failing to become an effective state  and the rise of Al-Shabaab, are a byproduct of international intervention in domestic politics.	Eggwanga lya Somalia okulemererwa okutebenkera n'okutandikibwawo kw'ekibiina kya Al-Shabaab, kivudde ku mawanga ag'ebweru okweyingiza mu by'obufuzi by'eggwanga eryo.
It is also difficult to see the strategic gains for Uganda in this intervention.	Kizibu okulaba Uganda weefunira mu kuyingira mu nsonga ezo.
However, it is strategically important for Museveni.	Naye ku luuyi olulala, ekyo ye Museveni akifunamu.
Ugandan troops presence in Somalia helps improve his standing in Washington DC, a factor that is vital for his domestic politics.	Amagye ga Uganda okubeera mu Somalia kimuwaako ekifaananyi ekirungi mu Amerika, era ekyo kimuyamba nnyo mu kunyweza eby'obufuzi mu Uganda.
In fact, when he came to power, United States President Barack Obama showed a cold attitude to Museveni,	Mu butuufu, Obama bwe yali yaakafuuka pulezidenti wa Amerika, yakiraga nti yali tamatira Museveni.
Now, with Ugandans paying with blood for American geo-strategic interests in this region, Museveni is indispensable to Obama’s plans for this region.	Naye kati olw'okuba omusaayi gwa bannayuganda guyiise okusobola okutuukiriza ebigendererwa bya Amerika mu kitundu kino, kati Obama atwala Museveni ng'omuntu ow'omugaso ennyo mu kutambuza enteekateeka z'alina ezikwata ku kitundu kino.
Because the gains from Somalia are personal to Museveni rather than national to Uganda,	Olw'okuba ekintu kino Museveni y'asinga okukifunamu so si Uganda,
I harbour a fundamental disagreement with democracy and human rights groups in Africa.	kindeetera okulowooza nti enkola ya demokulasiya awamu n'ebibiina ebirwanirira eddembe ly'obuntu tebiyamba Afirika.
Yet we are continuously told that only a democratic order built around a consensus would bring a stable peace in Somalia.	Wadde kiri kityo, beeyongera okutugamba nti enkola ya demokulasiya, ey'okugoberera abangi kye basazeewo, y'ejja okuleetawo emirembe egy'enkalakkalira mu Somalia.
Why we should pull out of Somalia.	Lwaki tulina okuva mu Somalia.
Aronda Nyakairima, received a threat assessment from the Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence detailing a serious threat from Allied Democratic Forces terrorists.

At the same time, information had been given to the police to communicate to the public about an impending attack.	Ate era n'ekitongole kya poliisi kyali kitegeezeddwa kisobole okulabula abantu ku bulumbaganyi obwali bujja.
At some seminars and conferences, police claim to have informed listeners to be careful.	Ekitongole kya poliisi kigamba nti waliwo enkuŋŋaana ezimu mwe kyayitira okulabula abantu.
Warning signs were already well apparent by the time a group of 24 former Allied Democartic Forces combatants were met on October 8, 2008.	Nga Okitobba 8, 2008, gavumenti we yasisinkanira abantu 24 abaali baava mu ggye lya ADF, kyali kimaze okweyoleka nti waaliwo obuzibu obwali bujja.
The former combatants, who had renounced violence to get amnesty and were retained by Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force as informers.	Abantu abo abaali baleseeyo obuyeekera basobole okusonyiyibwa baakuumibwa ekitongole ekirwanyisa ebikolwa eby'obutujju nga kyagala babeeko bye bakitegeeza.
The meeting was a pre-emptive security measure to divert the Allied Democratic Forces.	Olukuŋŋaana olwo lwali lwa kuwugula aba ADF.

During the meeting, the Allied Democratic Forces were asked to submit a document of their grievances.	Mu lukuŋŋaana olwo aba ADF baasabibwa okuwaayo ekiwandiiko okuli okwemulugunya kwabwe.
It was later submitted signed by one Hussein Maiga and the abovementioned Benz Tushabe.	Oluvannyuma baawaayo ekiwandiiko ekyo nga kiteekeddwako omukono gwa Hussein Maiga ne Benz Tushabe.
According to contents of the meeting, the ex-Allied Democratic Forces combatants referred to in the document as “reporters”  repeated their complaint.	Okusinziira ku byali mu lukuŋŋaana olwo, abo abaali baava mu ggye lya ADF, aboogerwako nga “balipoota” mu kiwandiiko ekyo baddamu okwogera okwemulugunya kwabwe.
They argued that the resettlement money they had received from the government was insufficient and that they felt forgotten.	Baagamba nti ssente gavumenti ze yabawa okubayamba okudda mu bulamu obwa bulijjo zaali tezimala era nti baali bawulira ng'abeerabirwa.
In the document, Allied Democratic Forces reporters complained that most of their combatants who got amnesty are youths.	Mu kiwandiiko ekyo aboogezi b'eggye lya ADF beemulugunya nti bangi ku bajjaasi baabwe abaaweebwa ekisonyiwo baali bavubuka.
The document noted that dealing with these youths requires care as they are targets of continued recruitment efforts by Allied Democratic Forces.	Ekiwandiiko kyagamba nti gavumenti esaanidde okwegendereza engeri gy'ekwatamu abavubuka abo kubanga kyangu abavubuka abo okusendebwasendebwa okuddamu okwegatta ku ggye lya ADF.
Government should come up with a program to engage these Muslim youths in active economic activities to avoid idleness and redundancy.	Gavumenti esaanidde okuteekawo programu eyamba abavubuka bano Abayisiramu okubaako emirimu gye bakola baleme kufuuka bakireereesi.
Security sources say Allied Democratic Forces reporters had been trying to meet president Museveni to present him their grievances.	Ensonda ez'eby'okwerinda zigamba nti aboogezi ba ADF baali bagezezzaako enfunda n'enfunda okusisinkana pulezidenti Museveni bamubuulire okwemulugunya kwabwe.
State House sources say they had not secured such audience by 7th November.	Ensonda okuva mu maka g'obwa pulezidenti zigamba nti Noovemba 7 we lwatuukira enteekateeka z'ensisinkano eyo zaali tezinnakakasibwa.
The last time Allied Democartic Forces had a meeting with the president was on February 03, 2004 .	Aba ADF baali baasemba okusisinkana pulezidenti nga Febwali 3, 2004 .
At the time, the president directed that jailed Allied Democartic Forces leaders Maneno Majaliwa and Sserwanga Bukenya be released.	Ku olwo, pulezidenti yalagira nti abakulembeze ba ADF, Maneno Majaliwa ne Sserwanga Bukenya, abaali mu kkomera bateebwe.
Because many of them work with and inside Uganda’s security organizations.	Olw'okuba bangi ku bo bakolera wamu n'ebitongole bya Uganda eby'eby'okwerinda era babirimu.
In an August 2008 internal assessment by Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force.	Lipoota eya Agusito 2008 eyafulumizibwa ekitongole ekirwanyisa obutujju.

The document had names of Allied Democratic Forces operatives on the run.	Alipoota eyo yalimu amannya g'abantu ADF be baali banoonya.

As a result of these operations, many Allied Democratic Forces combatants began to surrender to government.	Ebikwekweto ebyo byaviirako bangi ku bajaasi ba ADF okwewaayo mu mikono gya gavumenti.
Because Allied Democratic Forces was built around their religious faith.	Olw'okuba eggye lya ADF lyazimbibwa ku musingi gwa ddiini.

According to police, the existence of a sliced head is often a sign of suicide bombing.	Okusinziira ku poliisi, bw'olaba omutwe gw'omuntu nga gukutuse ne gugwa wali emirundi mingi kaba kabonero akalaga nti abatujju babalusizza bbomu.
Secondly, police sources say the sliced head at Lugogo was of a Somali while the one in Kabalagala was of a Ugandan.	Eky'okubiri, polisi egamba nti omutwe ogwali gubetentuse e Lugogo gwali gwa Musomaali ate ogwali e Kabalagala gwali gwa Munnayuganda.
According to security sources, this is the first “evidence” of the coordination and alliance between Allied Democratic Forces and Al Shabaab.	Okusinziira ku nsonda z'eby'okwerinda, obwo bwe bukakafu obwasooka okulaga nti aba ADF n'aba Al Shabaab baali bakolera wamu.
Last week, Kenya arrested a Ugandan suspected to be linked with the terrorism bombings in Kampala.	Wiiki eyaggwa, gavumenti ya Kenya yakwata Munnayuganda agambibwa okwenyigira mu kutega bbomu ezaabwatukira mu Kampala.
Ugandan security suspects he is an Allied Democratic Forces person.	Ab'eby'okwerinda mu Uganda bateebereza nti Munnayuganda oyo y'omu ku bayeekera ba ADF.
According to security sources since Allied Democratic Forces does not have a prior record in suicide bombing.	Okusinziira ku nsonda ez'eby'okwerinda, tewali kiraga nti emabega aba ADF baali beenyigira mu bikolwa eby'obutujju eby'okutega bbomu mu bantu.
The link between the two terrorist organisations is further strengthened by the theory that Allied Democratic Forces knows Kampala very well.	Kyeyongera okukakasibwa nti aba Al Shabaab baali bakolagana n'aba ADF okuva bwe kiteeberezebwa nti aba ADF bamanyi bulungi Kampala.
As mentioned earlier, Allied Democratic Forces has internal sources within Uganda’s intelligence services especially Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force	Nga bwe kiragiddwa waggulu, ADF erina abantu baayo mu bitongole bya Uganda eby'eby'okwerinda nnaddala mu kitongole ekirwanyisa obutujju
For Al Shabaab to succeed in its operations, it needed the Allied Democratic Forces infrastructure.	Aba Al Shabaab okusobola okukola obulumbaganyi bwabwe, baba beetaaga okukozesa ebintu bya ADF.
As Yoweri Museveni did in Uganda in 1986.	Nga Yoweri Museveni bwe yakola mu Uganda mu 1986.
Using financial incentives to stop Somalia from becoming an auxiliary to Al-Qaeda.	Okukozesa ssente okulemesa Somaliya okuwagira  Al-Qaeda.
I think we should pull out our troops; not because we are afraid of Al-Shabaab, but because we are not doing Somalis any good.	Ndowooza tulina okuggyayo amagye gaffe; si lwa kuba nti  tutya aba Al-Shabaab, naye lwa kuba tekiyamba Basomaali.
The terrorrists were working in conjunction with the Somali-based, al-Shabaab militant group.	Abatujju baali bakolaganira wamu n'aba Al-Shabaab abasinziira mu Somalia.
President Yoweri Museveni, all cabinet ministers, intelligence organisations and police recieved the radio message.	Pulezidenti Yoweri Museveni, baminisita bonna abali ku kabineeti, n'ebitongole ebikessi awamu ne poliisi baafuna obubaka.

For them to work as a team by conducting mass mobilisation campaigns to convince other Allied Democratic Forces combatants to renounce rebellion.	Okukolera awamu okukubiriza n'abalala mu ADF okulekayo obuyeekera.
Allied Democartic Forces terrorists had accumulated a lot of information on the location of security organisations, especially Joint Anti Terrorist Task Force.	Aba ADF baali bamanyi bingi ku wa ebitongole by'okwerinda we bisangibwa, naddala ekyo ekirwanyisa obutujju.
It was stated that the intentions of arrested Allied Democratic Forces operatives were among others elimination of security staff.	Kyagambibwa nti ekimu ku biruubirirwa by'abakessi ba ADF abaakwatibwa kwali kutta ab'eby'okwerinda.
Allied Democratic Forces Infiltrated intelligence.	Aba ADF baayingira mu kitongole ekikessi.
Yudaya Nansubuga and Mubiru Muhammad, all siblings of Ali Mubiru for their connection with Allied Democratic Forces activities on July 25, 2008.	Yudaya Nansubuga ne  Mubiru Muhammad, bonna nga baganda ba Ali Mubiru [baakwatibwa??] olw'okwenyigira mu bikolwa bya ADF nga Jjulaayi 25, 2008.
The government’s main advantage over them was its ability to provide them with monetary incentives.	Gavumenti we yali ebasingira kwe kuba nti yali esobola okubawa ssente.
Leaking internal state intelligence within security agencies to Allied Democartic Forces and provide misleading intelligence to security organisations.	Okubuulira aba ADF ebyama by'ebitongole eby'eby'okwerinda n'okuwa ebitongole by'eby'okwerinda obubaka obutali butuufu.

Security officers comb the scene of the bomb blast at Kyadondo Rugby Club Lugogo and exterminate urban terrorist squads and those in the countryside.	Ab'eby'okwerinda beekebejja awaabwatukira bbomu e Kyadondo Rugby Club e Lugogo era baamalawo obubiina bw'abatujju mu kibuga be mu bitundu ebirala.
The Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force team was led by a  Major	Ab'ekitongole ekirwanyisa obutujju baakulemberwa Meja
At the Lugogo scene, security found a Koran next to the severed head of the suicide bomber.	E Lugogo bbomu we yabwatukira ab'eby'okwerinda baasanga Koran okumpi n'omutwe gw'omutujju ogwali gubetenteddwa bbomu.
Again, the Independent is withholding the numbers in order not to jeopardise police investigations.	Omuwendo tegwatuukiriziddwa okwewala okutaataaganya okunoonyereza kwa poliisi.
From these leads, police suspects that the bombs were assembled in Kampala, largely but not entirely.	Okusinziira ku kunoonyereza, poliisi eteebereza nti okusingira ddala bbomu ezo zaapangibwa mu Kampala.
On July twelveth, security organisations deactivated a bomb at Makindye house.	Nga Jjulaayi 12, ab'eby'okwerinda baategulula bbomu ku nnyumba emu e Makindye.
It is not yet clear as to why the bomb did not go off on July eleventh.	Tekinnamanyibwa bulungi lwaki bbomu eyo teyabwatuka nga Jjulaayi 11.
However, security retrieved a Nokia one thousand two hundred eight series from the suicide jacket on which the explosive device was attached.	Naye ab'eby'okwerinda baggya essimu y'ekikya kya Nokia lukumi bibiri mu munaana mu jaketi y'omutujju eyaliko akuuma akatulisa bbomu.
The simcard inside the phone was first inserted into the handset on July eighth.	Kaadi y'esimu eyalimu yasooka okuteekebwa mu ssimu eyo nga Jjulaayi 8.
Police sources told the Independent that the handset retrieved from the suicide jacket had previously used Somali telephone numbers.	Ensonda mu poliisi zaategeeza Independent nti essimu eyaggibwa mu jaketi y'omutujju emabega yalimu layini za Somalia.
This therefore was not the first time Somalia was featuring in intelligence with connections to the Allied Democratic Forces.	Guno si gwe mulundi ogwali gusoose Somalia okulabikira mu kunoonyereza kw'eby'ab'okwerinda ng'ekwataganyizibwa ne ADF.
The ex-rebels in their two thousand eight document had clearly informed authorities of this possibe link.	Mu kiwandiiko kye baawandiika mu 2008, abayeekera abaali baabulidde ADF baategeeza ab'obuyinza ku kakwate ako.
The Somali numbers on the phone showed maximum integration between Al-Shabaab and Allied Democratic Forces.	Nnamba za Somalia ezaali ku ssimu eyo zaalagala nti waaliwo okukwatagana kwa maanyi wakati wa Al-Shabaab ne ADF.
However, the mobile handset used a Kenyan number between June twenty fourth and twenty eighth.	Naye wakati wa Jjuuni 24 ne Jjuuni 28 essimu eyo yalimu layini ya Kenya.
This further creates the link to some terrorists working in Kenya with a general indication of their regional reach.	Ekyo kiraga nti abatujju abamu bakolera mu Kenya era kiraga nti bakolera mu bitundu ebiwerako.
The bombings took place amidst increasing Allied Democratic Forces attacks in the Democratic Republic of Congo.	Mu kiseera bbomu ezo we zaabwatukira, aba ADF baali beeyongedde okukola obulumbaganyi mu bitundu bya Democratic Republic of Congo.
The terrorists are now international working through Somalia, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda.	Abatujju kati bakolera mu mawanga agawerako, omuli Somalia, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo, ne Uganda.
Safaricom and Mobile Telephone Network numbers were involved in the bombing according to the Independent.	Okusinziira ku Independent, empuliziganya eyaliwo nga bbomu tezinnabwatuka zaalimu layini za Safaricom n'eza MTN.
The Independent decided not to publish them on the advice of security officials as it would jeopardise Police investigations.	Aba Independent baasalawo obutafulumya nnamba za ssimu ezo olw'okuba ab'eby'okwerinda baakiraga nti kyanditaataaganyizza okunoonyereza kwa poliisi.
General Aronda Nyakairima, Brigadier James Mugira and Major General Kale Kayihura spearheaded the investigations.	Genero Aronda Nyakairima, Brigediya James Mugira ne Meja Genero Kale Kayihura be baawoma omutwe mu kunoonyereza.
On July seventh, Uganda sent a team to Nairobi to work with Kenyan security on how to handle the arrested terror suspects.	Nga Jjulaayi 7, Uganda yasindika ababaka e Nairobi okukolera awamu n'ekitongole kya Kenya eky'eby'okwerinda basalewo eky'okukola abo abaali bakwatiddwa nga bateeberezebwa okuba abatujju.
On June thirtieth, the Joint Anti-terrorism Task force under Criminal Millitary Intelligence killed Twaha Mohammed Kakande.	Nga Jjuuni 30, ekitongole ekirwanyisa obutujju nga kikolera wansi wa CMI kyatta Twaha Mohammed Kakande.
The Joint Anti-terrorism Task force arrested the Allied Democratic Forces collaborators in Mayuge district on July eighth.	Nga Jjulaayi 8, ekitongole ekirwanyisa obutujju kyakwata abo abaali bakolagana ne ADF mu disitulikiti y'e Mayuge.
Inspite of the security operations, security forces were unable to stop the terror attacks in Uganda on July eleventh.	Wadde ng'ab'eby'okwerinda baakola ebikwekweto bingi, tebaasobola kutangira batujju kubwatula bbomu mu Uganda nga Jjulaayi 11.
According to the chief of Criminal Millitary Intelligence Brigadier James Mugira, it is not easy to fight a symmetric warfare.	Okusinziira ku akulira ekitongole kya CMI Brigediya James Mugira, tekiba kyangu kulwana lutalo na mulabe alina amaanyi kumpi ge gamu n'agago era ng'akozesa obukodyo bwe bumu n'obubwo.
Ugandan security is limited in resources.	Ab'eby'okwerinda mu Uganda tebalina bikozesebwa bimala.
Mugira told the independent that fighting terrorisms requires the maximum cooperation of citizens.	Mugira yagamba olupapula lwa Independent nti okusobola okulwanyisa obutujju gavumenti yeetaaga obuyambi bw'abantu ba bulijjo.
Mugira dismissed corruption claims by asserting that the Joint Anti-terrorism Task force is well funded.	Mugira yakisambajja nti waliwo obulyi bw'enguzi bwe yagamba nti ekitongole ekirwanyisa obutujju kiweebwa ssente ezikimala.
Mugira explained that people use the excuse of fighting to make money.	Mugira yannyonnyola nti abantu beekwasa ensonga ey'okulwana okusobola okukola ssente.
The security forces made an assessment on the eleventh of July to ascertain what gave the terrorists an advantage.	Ab'eby'okwerinda beeyongera okwekenneenya ebyaliwo nga Jjulaayi 11, okulaba ensonga lwaki abatujju baasobola okukola obulumbaganyi obwo.
The Joint Intelligence Committee failed to share intelligence information.	Ekitongole kya Joint Intelligence Committee kyalemwa okubunyisa obubaka obwetaagisa mu by'okwerinda.
The External Security Organisation was informed by the United States of America and South Africa but did not inform the Internal Security Organistion.	Amerika ne South Africa baategeeza ekitongole kya ESO ku bulumbaganyi obwali bujja, naye ESO n'etetegeeza ISO.
The Joint Anti-terrorism Task force had information about the location and telephone numbers of terrorists.	Ekitongole ekirwanyisa obutujju kyali kimanyi wa abatujju we baali ne nnamba zaabwe ez'essimu.
The Rapid Response Unit of the Police  ascertained information on the plans of terrorists to bomb Kampala but lacked intelligence on their location.	Ekitongole kya poliisi ekya Rapid Response Unit kyakakasa nti abatujju baalina enteekateeka okukuba bbomu mu Kampala naye nga tekimanyi wa we bali.
The Joint Anti-terrorism Taskforce and the Rapid Response Unit did not share information to deter the terrorists plans.	Tewaaliwo mpuliziganya wakati w'ekitongole ekiranyisa obutujju n'ekya Rapid Response Unit okusobola okulemesa enteekateeka z'abatujju ezo.
Allied Democratic Forces cells in Kampala were cracked down as Uganda was preparing for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.	Obubinja bwa ADF mu Kampala baabufeffetta kubanga Uganda yali yeetegekera olukungaana lw'amawanga agali mu mukago gwa Bulaaya.
The Joint Anti-terrorism Task force spear headed security organisations in infiltrating terrorists cells with a purpose of arresting and detaining.	Ekitongole ekirwanyisa obutujju kye kyakulemberamu ebitongole by'eby'okwerinda mu kuketta obubinja bw'abatujju okubakwata n'okubaako we babakuumira.
The backbone of the terrorists was broken in two thousand seven.	Abatujju baabamala amaanyi mu 2007.
The operations under Leopold Kyanda, the chief of Criminal Millitary Intelligence involved abuses and corruption.	Ebikwekweto ebyaduumirwa Leopold Kyanda, eyali akulira ekitongole kya CMI byazingiramu okutulugunya n'obulyake.
Kyanda borrowed money at high interests rates to fund operations according to security sources.	Okusinziira ku nsonda z'eby'okwerinda, Kyanda yeewola ssente eziriko amagoba amangi asobole okufuna ssente ez'okukozesa mu bikwekweto.
Kyanda left the Joint Anti-terrorism Task force broke and heavily indebted.	Kyanda yaleka ekitongole ekirwanyisa obutujju nga kyavu era nga kirina amabanja mangi.
James Mugira replaced Kyanda and aimed first at improving the image of the Joint Anti-terrorism Task force.	James Mugira ye yadda mu bigere bya Kyanda era ekiruubirirwa kye yasooka okuba nakyo kyali kya kutereeza linnya lya kitongole ekirwanyisa obutujju.
Mugira told his officials that the Joint Anti-terrorism Task force should respect the law.	Mugira yagamba bakungu banne nti ekitongole ekirwanyisa obutujju kirina okugondera amateeka.
Security sources felt that although there was an improvement in security compared to the days of Kyanda, it was costly..	Ensonda z'eby'okwerinda zaagamba nti wadde ng'eby'okwerinda byatereeramu bw'obigeraageranya n'omulembe gwa Kyanda, ebintu tebyali byangu.
Mugira explained that the Joint Anti-terrorism Task force exaggerated the threat of the Allied Democratic Forces to make money.	Mugira yagamba nti ekitongole ekirwanyisa obutujju kyali kisavuwaza obulabe ADF bwe yali esobola okutuusa ku ggwanga olw'okwagala okukola ssente.
There were reports in March two thousand ten that the Allied Democratic Forces were going to train with Al-shabaab in Somalia.	Mu Maaki wa 2010, waaliwo ebyali biyitingana nti aba ADF baali bagenda kutendekera wamu n'aba Al-shabaab e Somalia.
Security sources told the Independent that operatives lacked money to transport food.	Ensonda z'eby'okwerinda zaategeeza Independent nti abatujju tebaalina ssente kutambuza mmere.
By eleventh July, the Allied Democratic Forces had already built cells outside the intelligence.	Jjulaayi 11 we lwatuukira, aba ADF baali baamala dda okutandikawo obubinja wabweru w'ekitongole ekikessi.
Allied Democratic Forces receive money through forex bureaus and bus companies for their operations.	Aba ADF baafuna ssente okuyitira mu bibanda bya ssente ne kampuni za bbaasi okusobola okuddukanya emirimu gyabwe.
The Allied Democratic Forces replaced its traditional operatives that are prone to Intelligence organisations.	Era ADF yakyusaamu enkola zaayo ezaali zisobola okulondoolwa ebitongole ebikessi.
Salaaf Mosques were used as centres of recruitment and indoctrination.	Aba ADF baakozesa emizikiti egimu ng'ebifo mwe baayingiriza abantu mu ggye lyabwe n'okubateekamu endowooza yaabwe.
Security assessments showed that the Allied Democratic Forces operatives resorted to using foreign telephone numbers to evade security.	Ab'eby'okwerinda baalaga nti aba ADF baasalawo okukozesa nnamba z'ebweru okwewala ab'eby'okwerinda okubagwamu.
The Ethiopian Village Restaurant was left in ruins after a bomb blast killed fifteen people in Kabalagala.	Wooteri ya Ethiopian Village Restaurant e Kabalagala yonna yasensebuka oluvannyuma lwa bbomu okubwatukiramu n'etta abantu 15.
"The New vision carried out a headline ""you could die during the World Cup""."	"Olupapula lwa New Vision lwafulumirako omutwe ogugamba nti ""Osobola Okufa ng'Olaba Omupiira gw'Ekikopo ky'Ensi Yonna""."
The call from New vision was clear considering the high rates of Human Immune Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, crime and road accidents in South Africa.	Okulabula okuva mu New Vision kwali kutegeerekeka bulungi, naddala bw'olowooza ku muwendo omunene ogw'abantu abalwala mukenenya, ebikolwa eby'obumenyi bw'amateeka, n'obubenje ebiri mu South Africa.
It was unfortunate that the message also applied to the people who converged in Kampala to watch the finals.	Kya nnaku nti obubaka obwo bwali bukwata ne ku bantu abaali bakungaanye okulaba fayinolo z'omupiira ku olwo.
More than seventy six people were reportedly dead and hundreds were seriously injured.	Kigambibwa nti abantu abasukka mu 76 baafa era bangi ne bagendera ku bisago eby'amaanyi.
It emerged that the terrorist attack was coordinated by Al-shabaab millitants in Somalia.	Kyazuulwa nti obulumbaganyi bwa bannalukalala obwo bwategekebwa aba Al-shabaab mu Somalia.
The bombs targeted Ethiopians and expatriates excluding football fans.	Bbomu ezo abatujju baazitega kutta nzaalwa za Esiyopiya n'abakungu abamu so si bawagizi ba mupiira.
Al-shabaab took responsibility for the bombings in Kampala.	Aba Al-shabaab baagamba nti be baali bavunaanyizibwa ku bbomu ezaabwatukira mu Kampala.
Commander Sheik Yusuf Issa told the Associated Press that Uganda was one of the Al-shabaab enemies afew hours after the attack.	Nga wayise essaawa ntono oluvannyuma lwa bbomu ezo okubwatuka, Omuduumizi Sheik Yusuf Issa yagamba Associated Press nti Uganda y'emu ku balabe ba Al-shabaab.
Whatever makes Uganda cry, makes Al-shabaab happy.	Ekikaabya Uganda, kisanyusa Al-shabaab.
If there was a link between these terror attacks, then it showed that Al-shabaab had extended their operations far beyond Somalia.	Bwe kiba nti waaliwo akakwate wakati w'obulumbaganyi obwo, kiba kiraga nti aba Al-shabaab baali bagaziyizza obulumbaganyi bwabwe okusukka ensalo za Somalia.
It will confirm that their leaders established threats to extend operations to Kampala and other countries with peace keeping missions to Somalia.	Kyali kiraga nti abakulembeze ba Al-shabaab baali bamalirivu okukola obulumbaganyi ku Kampala ne ku mawanga amalala agaali gasindise amagye mu Somalia okuzzaawo emirembe.
The Uganda People's Defence Forces tightened peace keeping operations in Somalia.	Eggye lya UPDF lyayongera amaanyi mu bikwekweto eby'okukuuma emirembe mu Somalia.
Countries which had promised to send troops are likely to be discouraged by the attacks and therefore unlikely to be part of the African Union Mission to Somalia.	Ekyo kyali kisobola okumalamu amaanyi ensi ezaali zisuubizza okusindika amagye ne ziteegatta ku mukago gwa African Union Mission to Somalia.
Somali terrorists are linked to high profile attacks in East Africa that is, the Nineteen Ninety Eight bombings of the United States of America Embassy in Dar-es-salaam and Nairobi where over Two Hundred people died.	Abatujju Abasomaali bagambibwa okuba nga be baali emabega w'obulumbaganyi obw'amaanyi obwakolebwa mu mawanga agali mu Buvanjuba bwa Afirika , omwali okukuba bbomu ekitebe kya Amerika mu Dar-es-salaam ne mu  Nairobi mu 1998 abantu abasukka mu 200 ne bafa.
These attacks were also linked to Al-qaeda, the top most terror organisation in the world.	Kigambibwa nti n'aba Al-qaeda, nga kino kye kibiina ky'abatujju ekisinga okuba eky'obulabe mu nsi, baalina omukono mu bulumbaganyi obwo.
Al-shabaab attacks have had an impact on the security architecture in East Africa and Africa at large.	Obulumbaganyi bwa Al-shabaab bwaleetawo enkyukakyuka mu by'okwerinda mu Buvanjuba bwa Afirika ne mu Afirika okutwalira awamu.
Ethiopian troops drove them out of Somalia in support of the United Nations backed interim government.	Eggye lya Esiyopiya ly'abagoba mu Somalia nga liwagira gavumenti ey'ekiseera eyali ewagirwa ekibiina ky'Amawanga Amagatte.
The group refused to engage in the peace process which brought elements of the Islamic Courts.	Aba Al-Shabaab baagaana okwenyigira mu nteseganya ez'okuleetawo emirembe ezaaleeta ababaka okuva mu Islamic Courts.
Sharif Ahmed, a former leader of the Islamic Courts was sworn in as the President of Somalia.	Sharif Ahmed, eyaliko omukulembeze wa Islamic Courts yalayizibwa okuba Pulezidenti wa Somalia.
Islamic Courts vowed to topple him for betraying the country.	Aba Islamic Courts beerayirira okumaamulako gavumenti ye olw'okuba yali aliddemu ensi olukwe.
Al-shabaab is headed by Mohammed Abdi Godane.	Al-shabaab ekulemberwa Mohammed Abdi Godane.
Al-shabaab has always waged war against Somalia's fragile Transitional Governments forces since two thousand six.	Okuva mu 2006, aba Al-shabaab babaddenga balwanyisa amagye ga gavumenti ez'ekiseera ennafu.
Some Al-shabaab fighters were trained by the Taliban in Afghanistan.	Abamu ku balwanyi ba Al-shabaab baatendekebwa Batalibaani mu Afghanistan.
The United States of America's Federal Bureau of Investigations had concerns over the terror group expanding its network.	Ekitongole kya Amerika ekikessi kyafuna obweraliikirivu olw'ekibiina ky'abatujju ekyo okusaasaana.
No one knows how Al-shabaab solicits funds however, Eritrea and some Arab nations have been accused of funding Al-shabaab though Asmara has continously denied the allegations.	Kyokka tewali amanyi ngeri aba Al-shabaab gye bafunamu ssente, Eritrea n'amawanga g'Abawalabu agamu gateeberezebwa okuba nga ge gawa aba  Al-shabaab ssente wadde ng'ekyo Eritrea emaze ebbanga ng'ekyegaana.

In its spirited fight against terrorism, Joint Anti-terrorist Task Force has encountered a number of problems.	Mu kufuba okulwanyisa obutujju, ekitongole ekirwanyisa obutujju kisanze obuzibu obutali bumu.
These are Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya from where they plan and coordinate their operations.	Muno mwe muli ensi ya Democratic Republic of Congo n'eya Kenya abatujju gye balukira enkwe zaabwe era gye baddukanyiza emirimu gyabwe.
This means Joint Anti-terrorist Task Force's operations in pursuing them are quite very difficult.	Kino kiba kitegeeza nti ebikwekweto eby'okuwondera abatujju abo ebikolebwa ekitongole ekyo bisanga emiziziko mingi.
Allied Democratic Forces have sentimental feelings.	Aba ADF beegonza.
The amnesty law until recently was being exploited, however a number of Allied Democratic Force operatives upon getting amnesty have bounced back to terror activities.	Etteeka erikwata ku kuwa abantu ekisonyiwo limaze ebbanga nga likozesebwa bubi, era aba ADF abawerako abaaweebwa ekisonyiwo baamala ate ne baddayo mu butujju.
The Allied Democratic Forces has continued to use Salaaf Mosques and Luzira Prison as their indoctrination,recruitment and coordination centres,	Aba ADF beeyongedde okukozesa emizikiti gy'Abasalaafi n'ekkomera ly'e Prison ng'ebifo we bafunira ab'okuyingiza mu ggye lyabwe n'okubayingizaamu endowooza yaabwe.

How can new business be established in countries like Uganda where corruption is high?	Bizineesi empya ziyinza zitya okutandikibwawo mu nsi nga Uganda omuli obulyi bw'enguzi obungi?
It’s discouraging when citizens lose six business hours per day because of potholes only explained by corruption somewhere in Kampala City Council.

What should concern us is the quality of the population.	Ekisaanidde okutweraliikiriza gwe mutindo gw'obulamu bw'abantu.
However, the rapid growth of low quality population in such a short time can have serious implications for Uganda’s hope. 	Naye okuba nti mu kaseera katono omuwendo gw'abantu abalina omutindo gw'obulamu ogwa wansi gweyongedde nnyo kiyinza okukosa ennyo ebiseera bya Uganda eby'omu maaso.

Therefore can’t kill the germs and bacteria,” said Ssekitoleko.	Ssekitoleko yagamba nti eddagala eryo liba terisobola kutta buwuka.
By day break everything is in order.	We bukeerera buli kimu kiba bulungi.
This happens in low income areas where buyers lack information and buy without first checking the expiry date.	Kino kibaawo mu bitundu bya bamufuna mpola abantu abasinga gye bali mu butamanya era abagula ebintu nga tebasoose kukebera ddi lwe biggwaako.

Uganda has a Sale of Goods Act of niteen fifty which carries a very small penalty.	Etteeka erikwata ku kutunda ebintu Uganda ly'erina lyassibwawo mu 1950 era engassi omuntu akwatiddwa gy'awa okusinziira ku tteeka eryo ntono nnyo.
Under Clause twenty of the Act, there is a legal responsibility for anybody not to manufacture, sell, distribute or hold for the purpose of selling any product that does not meet usual Uganda standards.	Okusinziira ku kawaayiro nnamba 20 ak'etteeka eryo, buli omu avunaanyizibwa mu mateeka okwewala okukola, okutunda, okubunyisa, oba okukuuma ekintu kyonna ekitatuukana na mutindo n'ekigendererwa eky'okukitunda.
Uganda National Bureau of Standards officials say, in some cases, the offenders totally change the expiry date on the products and blame the practice on the expansion of small manufacturing units in homes turned into factories.	Abakungu mu UNBS bagamba nti mu mbeera ezimu abantu bakyusa ennaku z'omwezi ebintu kwe biggwerako era bagamba nti ekyo kivudde bukampuni bungi okutandikibwawo mu maka g'abantu.
And to urgently build a awareness citizen agency determined to demand accountability and responsibility.	Okusobola okuzibula abantu amaaso, ekitongole kyasalawo okusaba abakola ebintu okuwa alipoota ku bye bakola.
Forexample the Uganda Export promotion board and its District Information Centers program.	Ng'ekyokulabirako, waliwo ekitongole ekikola ku bintu ebifuluma eggwanga ne ofiisi zaakyo mu disitulikiti.
Over the last ten years, agriculture productivity has been decreasing from seven percent to now one point three percent growth, as such the agriculture sector contribution to Growth Domestic Product is twentry one percent.	Mu myaka ekkumi egiyise, ebintu ebiva mu by'obulimi bikendedde okuva ku bitundu musanvu ku buli kikumi ne bituuka ku kitundu kimu n'obutundutundu busatu ku buli kikumi, ne kiba nti eby'obulimi biri ebitundu 21 ku buli kikumi ku bintu ebikolebwa mu ggwanga.
Focus on building competent producer organisations and execute implementation strategies like National Agricultural Advisory Services with precision.	Okussa essira ku kuba n'abakozi b'ebintu abalungi n'okussa obulungi mu nkola enteekateeka gamba ng'eza National Agricultural Advisory Services.
Uganda has one of the highest fertility rates and one of the fastest growing populations in Africa.	Uganda y'emu ku nsi za Afirika omuli abantu abazaala ennyo era omuwendo gw'abantu mwe gulinnyira ku sipiidi.
To develop as a middle income economy over the next twenty five years.	Okutumbula eby'enfuna by'eggwanga bidde ku ddaala eriddako mu myaka 25 egiddako.
Uganda like the rest of the world is struggling with addition of climate change; usual droughts, floods, landslides, diseases, and deepening water crisis.	Okufaananako amawanga amalala mu nsi ne Uganda nayo eyolekagana n'obuzibu bw'embeera y'obudde; omuli ebyeya, amataba, okubumbulukuka kw'ettaka, endwadde, n'ekizibu ky'amazzi.
Let us take an example of Ingabire Victoire who has been cited by the international media as an example.	Ka tulowooze ku Ingabire Victoire amanyiddwa mu nsi okuba ekyokulabirako ekirungi.
Ingabire's link to the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda is well known.	Bangi bakimanyi nti Ingabire yakolagana n'eggye lya Democratic Forces okununula Rwanda.
Her way of thinking, as shown by her speeches both before and after her arrival in Rwanda in two thousand ten.	Engeri gy'alowoozaamu erabikira mu bye yayogeranga nga tannatuuka mu Rwanda n'oluvannyuma lw'okutuukayo mu 2010.
Her intention is to attain political power in Rwanda.	Ekigendererwa kye kya kufuuka mukulembeze mu Rwanda.
Generally, it would be difficult to make a good analysis of the Rwandan situation.	Okutwalira awamu si kyangu kumanya bulungi mbeera eri mu Rwanda.
The problem arises that analysts like George Ayitty mislead the world by focusing on isolated incidents.	Kigambibwa nti abantu abamu nga George Ayitty babuzaabuza ensi nga basinziira ku buntu obutonotono obuba bubaddewo.
There is no way Rwanda would have made both political and socio-economic achievements if the people were under an oppressive regime.	Tewali ngeri Rwanda gye yandisobodde kukulaakulana mu bya bufuzi, mu mbeera z'abantu, ne mu by'obusuubuzi singa obukulembeze bwayo bwali bunyigiriza abantu.
Today, the overall percentage of people insured is ninty one percent.	Leero, abantu 91 ku buli kikumi balina yinsuwa.
As a result of this policy, child death rate fell from eighty six per one thousand  live births in two thousand five to sixty two per one thousand in two thousand eight.	Enkola eno yaleetera omuwendo gw'abaana abafa nga bazaalibwa okukka okuva ku 86 ku buli lukumi mu 2005 okutuuka ku 62 ku buli lukumi mu 2008.
Maternal death has also dropped from more than one thousand seventy one  deaths per one hundred  live births between nineteen ninity five and two thousand to six hundred.	Omuwendo gw'abakazi abafa nga bazaala nagwo gwakka okuva ku bakazi abasukka 1,0701 mu 1995 okudda ku 600 mu 2000.
Life expectancy has also gone up to fifty years from forty two years, ten years ago.	Era kati okutwalira awamu abantu bawangaala okusinga bwe kyali emyaka kkumi emabega; baali bawangaala emyaka 42 naye kati bawangaala 50.
Under the Universal Primary Education, net pupil enrolment is at ninety six percent, according to two thousand nine statistics.	Era okusinziira ku kunoonyereza okwakolebwa mu 2006, okuva enkola ya bonna basome lwe yatandikibwawo, kati abaana 96 ku buli kikumi basoma.
With such policies, Rwanda has realised Gross domestic product  growth throughout the past years.	Enkola ezo ziyambye Rwanda okulaba enkulaakulana mu myaka gyonna egiyise.
The government of Rwanda is not perfect.	Gavumenti ya Rwanda nayo tetuukiridde.
Crime is high in many cities of the United States.	Obumenyi bw'amateeka bungi mu bitundu bingi ebya Amerika.
But that cannot make United States leaders dictators.	Naye ekyo tekituleetera kugamba nti abakulembeze mu Amerika bannakyemalira.
Foreign governments and media should give chance to Rwandans.	Gavumenti z'amawanga amalala ne bannamawulire basaanidde okuwa Rwanda akadde.
Let Rwandans decide who their leaders should be.	Abanyarwanda tusaanidde okubaleka beesalirewo baani abasaanidde okubakulembera.
The fate of Rwandans will not be surrendered to self-appointed opposition leaders.	Ebiseera bya Rwanda eby'omu maaso tebijja kulekebwa mu mikono gy'abo abawakanya gavumenti abeenoonyeza ebyabwe.
Rwandans have more stake in what is happening.	Abanyarwanda balina ekifaananyi kinene ku ebyo ebigenda mu maaso.
George Ayittey and others should come down to Rwanda and interact with Rwandans before he makes his unlikely conclusions.	George Ayittey n'abalala basaanidde okusooka okugenda e Rwanda ne boogerako n'abantu baayo nga tebannayogera bintu bye bateekakasa.

He revealed that one of Obura”s groups called SASA defected to Uganda People's Defence Forces with his Lukwiya’s wife.	Yagamba nti ekimu ku bibinja bya Obura ekiyitibwa SASA ekyalimu mukyala we kyabaabulira ne kyegatta ku UPDF.
Odyam is coordinating to meet Kony and has already crossed.	Odyam akwasaganya ensonga z'okusisinkana Kony era amaze okusomoka.
The second river, has shot twice in the air but Kony did not hear.	Omugga ogw'okubiri, akubye amasasi mu bbanga emirundi ebiri naye Kony tagawulidde.

Comments Kony’s negative comment on Lakwena’s return was shortened by after thought of what has been going on between him and Betty Bigombe.	Ebigambo ebitali birungi Kony bye yali ayogera ku Lakwena byasalwako ebyo ebyali bigenda mu maaso wakati we ne Betty Bigombe.
Because the way he started, he looked ready to criticise Lakwena’s move with some abuses.	Kubanga engeri gye yatandikamu okwogera yalabika ng'eyali agenda okuvumirira ekyo Lakwena kye yakola.
But he remembered how Otti and some other commanders are inclined to peace deal with government and they expect him to agree some how.	Naye yakijjukira nti Otti n'abaduumizi abalala baali baagala okukola endagaano ey'emirembe ne gavumenti era nga bamusuubira naye okukkiriziganya nakyo.
Therefore his comment that “could be God’s plans and President Museveni’s convincing language” was meant to make Otti and other commanders hopeful.	N'olwekyo, ebigambo bye yayogera nti “ziyinza okuba nga ntegeka za Katonda oba nga Pulezidenti Museveni ye yasendasenda Lakwena” yabyogera kuwa Otti n'abaduumizi abalala ssuubi.
Otti’s story on Lakwena’s move is meant to show Kony that things can end peacefully.	Otti bye yayogera ku Lakwena yabyogera kuleetera Kony kukiraba nti ebintu bisobola okukomekkerezebwa mu mirembe.
Kony has now come clear on his move to incriminate his commanders by involving them, in committing atrocities in their home areas. 	Ekigendererwa kya Kony kyeyoleka bulungi nti yali ayagala okutattana erinnya ly'abaduumizi be ng'abaleetera okukola ebivve mu bitundu gye bava.

Abudema reported to Otti that Kitgum Local council five chairman Nahaman Ojwee survived ambush in Ngomoromo yesterday.	Abudema yagamba Otti nti ssentebe wa LC5 owa Kitgum Nahaman Ojwee yawonyeewo mu bulumbaganyi obwakoleddwa e Ngomoromo jjo.

He replied to Otti that he went to Kitgum to attack a certain project and withdrew safely.	Yagamba Otti nti yali agenze e Kitgum okulumba projekiti emu naye nti yavuddeyo mirembe.

Otti’s question to Abudema why he was in Kitgum may be connected with what some government agents.	Otti okubuuza Abudema ensonga lwaki yagenda e Kitgum kiyinza okuba nga kyalina akakwate n'ekyo abamu ku babaka ba gavumenti [kye bagamba??]
This is in Kitgum, Otti might be knowing about it and there is likelihood that he thinks Abudema doesn’t know. 	Kino kiri Kitgum, Otti ayinza okuba akimanyiiko era ayinza okuba alowooza nti Abudema takimanyi.

Amongst the socialites, were numerous young talented actors, editors, screenwriters and directors who had all gathered to celebrate the success of Ugandan film.	Abamu ku abo abaakungaana okujaguza olw'ekyo Uganda kye yali etuuseeko mu kuzannya firimu mwe mwali bannakatemba bangi abato, abasunsuzi, abawandiisi, ne badayirekita.
In the auditorium, people clamoured for seats for the showpiece of the night, a screening of IMANI.	Abantu bangi baanoonya ebifo aw'okutuula basobole okulaba firimu eyitibwa IMANI.
IMANI was directed by Carol Kamya and other alumni from Maisha, an organization dedicated to providing training to Ugandan filmmakers.	Carol Kamya n'abalala okuva mu kitongole kya Maisha be baali badayirekita ba firimu ya IMANI era ekitongole ekyo kifuba okutendeka bannayuganda mu kukola firimu.
The scenes are familiar to a Ugandan audience but actually seeing them onscreen, executed in such a professional manner, is wholly unfamiliar.	Ebyali mu firimu eyo byali si bipya nnyo eri Bannayuganda, naye okubiraba ku lutimbe nga bitegekeddwa mu ngeri ey'ekikugu kyali kipya nnyo.
Inorder to understand the story properly it is important to go back to 2005 to when Mina Zair, acclaimed director of international hits such as Monsoon Wedding and The Namesake, established Maisha.	Kino okusobola okukitegeera, kikulu okuddayo ne tulowooza ku mwaka gwa 2005 ekibiina kya Maisha lwe kyatandikibwawo Mina Zair, eyali dayirekita wa firimu ezaakyaka ennyo mu nsi gamba nga Monsoon Wedding ne The Namesake.
For years, Uganda has tended to import most of its culture, the hip hop, RnB and reggae that populates the charts is based on western music.	Uganda yamala emyaka mingi nga yeesigama nnyo ku nnyimba z'ebweru omuli hip hop, RnB ne reggae nga ze zisinga okukubwa.
Sharpe Ssewali, a young screenwriter and director who is currently getting his film off the ground, says this phenomenon has to be stopped. .	Sharpe Ssewali, omuwandiisi era dayirekita omuto kati alina firimu ye gy'akolako, agamba nti enkola eyo erina okukoma.
Kimanje Mark, the marketing manager for IMANI, cited the example of how Congolese music, another outside source, dominated in Uganda until ten or fifteen years ago.	 Kimanje Mark, kitunzi wa firimu ya IMANI, yayogera ku ngeri ennyimba z'e Congolese gye zaali zeefuze Uganda okutuusa emyaka nga kkumi oba kkumi n'etaano emabega.
Now the music scene is almost exclusively populated by Ugandan acts, many of them performing in their native tongue, and it remains a massively popular industry.	Naye kati ekisaawe ky'okuyimba kati kumpi kirimu bannayuganda bokka, nga bangi ku bo bayimba mu nnimi za wano era bettanirwa nnyo.
Even the fact that IMANI, a relatively low-budget film made by several young Ugandan filmmakers, was shown at Cineplex, up against the enormous power and finances of Hollywood films shows that Ugandan film deserves its platform.	Okuba nti firimu ya IMANI, eyakolebwa Bannayudanga abato abawerako ku nsaasaanya entono, yalagibwa mu Cineplex, omulagibwa firimu ez'amaanyi eziteekebwamu ssente empitirivu gamba ng'eza Hollywood kiraga nti Bannayuganda basobola okuyingira mu bujjuvu mu kisaawe kya firimu.
There are, however, some serious challenges to Ugandan filmmaking.	Naye waliwo okusoomooza mu kisaawe ky'okukola firimu mu Uganda.
Matt Bish, a director and editor who previously worked in the Netherlands, says that even as someone who owns and manages his own studio, he has no proper way of controlling the distribution of his films.	Matt Bish, dayirekita era omusunsuzi eyakolerako mu Netherlands, agamba nti okufaananako omuntu alina era addukanya situdiyo ye ey'obwannanyini, kiba kizibu okufuga engeri firimu ze gye zibunyisibwamu.
Thankfully, events like Maisha African Film festival and, the other great film event in Kampala, Amakula Film Festival, which has now been running for six years, are around to try and increase awareness of Ugandan films outside of pirated distribution.	Ekirungi kiri nti emikolo ng'egyo egitegekebwa aba Maisha African Film n'emirala egikwata ku firimu egitegekebwa mu Kampala aba Amakula Film Festival, kati egimaze emyaka mukaaga nga gitegekebwa gigendereddwa okumanyisa abantu ku firimu za Uganda awatali kuzibunyisa mu ngeri emenya amateeka.
Amakula showcases reclaiming national culture for years, Uganda has tended to import most of its culture, the hip hop, RnB and reggae that populates the charts is based on Western music, the films that dominate Cineplex and get quickly copied and sold in Wandegeya or Kisementi are normally from the United States of America or India.	Okumala emyaka mingi aba Amakula bafubye okulwanirira obuwangwa bw'eggwanga, kubanga ennyimba ezisinga obungi mu Uganda omuli eza hip hop, RnB, ne reggae zibaddenga zitumbula buwangwa bwa bweru, era firimu ezisinga okulagibwa mu Cineplex abantu ne banguwa okuzikopa n'okuzitundira e Wandegeya oba ku Kisementi emirundi mingi zisibuka mu Amerika oba mu Buyindi.
Before the ecstasies of the inaugural screening of the first African Film Festival at National Theatre, Maisha had been running a series of workshops where industry experts had been teaching young Ugandans techniques and tricks for how to put together a great movie.	Firimu y'oku lukalu lwa Afirika bwe yali tennaba kulagibwa mu National Theatre mulundi gusooka, aba Maisha baali bamaze ekiseera nga bategeka emisomo okubangula Bannayuganda mu bukodyo obw'okukola firimu.
At the last workshop, run by American actor Giancarlo Esposito (The Usual Suspects, School Daze, Do The Right Thing), there was a packed room of aspiring actors and actresses who soaked up Mr Esposito’s remarkable passion and sensible advice.	Omusomo ogwasembayo ogwategekebwa omuzannyi wa firimu Omumerika Giancarlo Esposito (eyazannya The Usual Suspects, School Daze, Do The Right Thing), gwajumbirwa nnyo abantu bangi abaali baagala okufuuka abazannyi ba firimu abaassaayo ennyo omwoyo ku ebyo Mw. Esposito bye yayogera ne ku magezi amalungi ge yawa.
One of the people he touched with his workshop was Peace Among, a twenty four year old actress who first started performing in plays at school.	Omu ku bantu abaakwatibwako omusomo ogwo yali Peace Among, omuzannyi w'emizannyo ow'emyaka 24 nga yasooka kugizannya ng'akyasoma.
Just like several other young people involved in the burgeoning film industry here, Among studied an unrelated subject at university, Journalism, others had done Civil Engineering, Architecture and even Biological Science before realising that she had to follow her passion.	Okufaananako abavubuka abalala abali mu kisaawe ky'okuzannya firimu ekitandese okukula mu Uganda, Among yasomerera bintu birala ku yunivasite, yasomerera bya mawulire, ate abalala baali baasomerera bya kuzimba, bya kukuba pulaani, n'ebirala, naye oluvannyuma Amongo yakiraba nti yalina okukola ekyo ky'asinga okwagala.
Among says her real passion is acting and that it will take her all the way to Hollywood, a line that is said with a laugh but with an undercurrent of determination that seems firmly rooted in everyday life.	Among agamba nti asinga kwagala kuzannya firimu era nti ekyo kijja kumutuusa ne mu Hollywood; ekyo yakyogera aseka naye ng'alaga obumalirivu era obumalirivu bwe bweyolekera ne mu by'akola mu bulamu bwe obwa bulijjo.
The platform provided by excellent teaching at Maisha combined with the incredible passion and support of the young Ugandans who want to make films stands them in good stead.	Okutendekebwa okulungi ennyo okuva mu kibiina kya Maisha, okwagala Bannayuganda abato kwe balina mu kuzannya firimu, n'obuwagizi bwe bafuna bijja kubayamba nnyo.
What is more, this is a country in which there are many stories to tell, the international success of The Last King of Scotland is a prime example of this, most of which remain untold.	Okugatta ku ekyo, Uganda erina ebintu bingi ebisobola okwogerwako n'okulagibwa n'etutumuka, nga bwe kyali ku firimu ya The Last King of Scotland eyasigala nga waliwo bingi ebitalagiddwa.
The more this energy that surrounds filmmaking in Uganda lasts the more likely high quality films such as IMANI or Bish’s Battle Of The Souls, will be produced.	Singa amaanyi agateereddwa mu kukola firimu mu Uganda tegakendeera, tujja kusobola okulaba nga firimu endala ez'omutindo ogwa waggulu gamba nga IMANI oba Bish’s Battle Of The Souls, nga zikolebwa.
Trust and public awareness of Ugandan filmmaking will consequently grow, creating more opportunities and, finally a proper industry.	Abantu bajja kweyongera okwettanira n'okumanya ebikwata ku kukola firimu mu Uganda era ekisaawe kya firimu kijja kweyongera okukula kiggumire.
“Whenever people see a really good Ugandan film there’s a lot of excitement about it, people think  yeah, we can really do this!’” says Bish.	Bish agamba nti “Buli abantu lwe balaba firimu ya Bannayuganda ennungi basanyuka nnyo era bagamba nti ddala naffe tusobola okuzannya obulungi firimu!’”
Having that belief is one of the big issues for funding because these companies don’t believe that Ugandans can actually make something good.	Obwesige obwo bukulu Bannayuganda bwe baba ba kuweebwa ssente kubanga kampuni eziteekamu ssente tezikkiriza nti Bannayuganda basobola okukola ekintu kyonna ekirungi.
This is the dream of those young filmmakers who stood and applauded Ms Nair’s message.	Ekyo kye kirooto abakozi ba firimu abato abasituka ne bakubira Nair engalo kye balina.
As ironic as it may seem, this is the type of guy who appeals to the average Ugandan female.	Ono ye musajja asobola okusikiriza kumpi buli mukazi Munnayuganda.
Unlike some Ugandan men, they are easy to identify from their arrogant behaviour while in public places especially average to high class eatouts or entertainment spots.	Teyeeyisa nga basajja Bannayuganda abamu, abeeraga nga baliira mu bifo eby'ebbeeyi oba nga bagenda mu bifo ebisanyukirwamu eby'ebbeeyi.

IMANI depicts a day in the life of three Ugandans, a child soldier returning home, a maid desperate to help her friend and a young breakdancer trying to follow his dreams.	Firimu ya IMANI eraga obulamu bwa Bannayuganda basatu, omwana eyayingizibwa mu magye ng'akomawo awaka, omukozi wa waka ayagala ennyo okuyamba mukwano gwe, n'omuzinyi omuto agezaako okutuuka ku birooto bye.
"Ms Zair stated publically on opening night, “If we don’t tell our own stories, no one else will""."	"Ku lunaku olwasooka, Muky. Zair yagamba abawuliriza nti, “Bwe tutabuulira balala bitukwatako, tewali ajja kubibabuulira""."
The films that dominate Cineplex and get quickly copied and sold in Wandegeya or Kisementi are normally from the USA or India, even something as simple as what people wear everyday is, by and large, far from Ugandan in origin.	Firimu ezisinga okulagibwa mu Cineplex era ezikopebwa amangu ne zitundibwa e Wandegeya ku Kisementi ziteera kuba za Bamerika oba Bayindi, n'ekintu ekirabika ng'ekitono gamba ng'ebyo abantu bye baambala buli lunaku, biba byawukana nnyo ku bya Bannayuganda.
"""It’s time Africa exported its culture to the rest of the world,” he reasons."	"Agamba nti ""Kye kiseera Afirika okubunyisa obuwangwa bwayo ne mu mawanga amalala mu nsi.”"
Uganda's film movement is providing entertainment and showcasing East African talent as well as bringing international films, although some have criticised the festival for placing too much emphasis on the latter, to the attention of the general public.	Ekisaawe kya firimu mu Uganda kisanyusa abantu era kitumbula ebitone by'abantu abali mu nsi z'omu Buvanjuba bwa Afirika, nga mw'otwalidde n'okubaleetera firimu ez'amawanga amalala, wadde ng'ekyo abamu bakyemulugunyaako nga bagamba nti batumbula nnyo firimu ez'amawanga amalala.
"She models in Nairobi and has just released a single under her stage name Peace ""The Luo""."	" Modo mu kibuga Nairobi era yaakafulumya alubaamu ya singo mu mannya ga Peace ""The Luo"" g'akozesa ku siteegi ."

It happened in the 1970s when Idi Amin declared he would eat for life until he was herded out like a stubborn bull in a kraal in 1979.	Kyaliwo mu myaka gya 1970 Idi Amin bwe yagamba nti agenda kufuga obulamu bwe bwonna okutuusa lwe yasindiikirizibwa mu 1979 ng'ente esindiikirizibwa okuva mu kiraalo.

In fact for this reason Uganda has never relinquished leadership peacefully since independence.	Mu butuufu eyo ye nsonga lwaki okuva lwe twafuna obwetwaze, mu Uganda obufuzi tebukyukangako mu mirembe.
While in other countries leadership is changed by the ballot, in Uganda it looks it will be changed by either the inevitable fate of age or any other unpreventable occurrence.	Wadde nga mu nsi endala omufuzi akyusibwa kalulu, kirabika mu Uganda omufuzi ajja kukyusibwa lwa myaka gye oba ekintu ekirala ekiteebeereka.

Remember Uganda has the second highest road carnage on the continent after Ethiopia.	Kijjukire nti Uganda y'eddirira Esiyopiya mu nsi za Afirika esizingayo okubaamu obubenje.
The Uganda People's Congress announced it had pulled out of the Inter Party Cooperation.	Ekibiina kya UPC kyalangirira nti kivudde mu mukago ogugatta awamu ebibiina by'obufuzi.
The Uganda People's Congress cited lack of transparency, accountability and deviating from the collective position initially agreed upon.	UPC yagamba nti temwali bwerufu era nti abaalimu baali bavudde ku mulamwa gwe bakkiriziganyaako.
The Uganda People's Congress  was part and parcel of the founding of Inter Party Cooperation.	Aba UPC be bamu ku baatandikawo omukago gw'ebibiina by'obufuzi.
However president Olara Otunnu said his party would be willing to work with its former partners  within a broader framework of the national democratisation process.	Naye pulezidenti Olara Otunnu yagamba nti yali mwetegefu okukolera awamu n'ebibiina ebirala mu kuleetawo demokulasiya mu ggwanga.
The Uganda People's Congress instead will now partner with Civil Society Organisations, religious institutions and pressure groups to push for free and fair elections.	Era yagamba nti kati ekibiina kya UPC kyali kijja kusinga kukolagana ne bibiina ebikola ku mbeera z'abantu, ebibiina by'obufuzi, n'ebibiina ebyagala okuleetawo enkyukakyuka, okulaba nti wabaawo okulonda okw'obwenkanya.
Uganda People's Congress exit  started a fortnight ago when the other cooperating parties nominated their flag bearers to compete for the joint candidate for 2011.

The Head of the Inter Party Cooperation Secretariat Dr Frank Nabwiso described Uganda People's Congress decision to quit the opposition alliance.	Dr Frank Nabwiso akulira Inter Party Cooperation Secretariat yayogera ku kya UPC okusalawo okuva mu mukago gw'ebibiina ebivuganya gavumenti.
It is unfortunate that Uganda People's Congress has reached that decision.	Kyannaku nti UPC yasalawo bw'etyo.
Uganda People's Congress has always been at the forefront of inter party cooperation right from 1962.	Okuva mu 1962, UPC ebadde ku mwanjo nnyo mu mukago gw'ebibiina.
In 1979 during the Moshi conference, again Uganda People's Congress was very instrumental and also played a major role in the politics in the 1980.	Mu 1979 mu lukungaana olwali e Moshi, UPC era yalina kinene kye yakola era yalina ekifo kikulu mu by'obufuzi mu 1980.
He said Uganda People's Congress had pulled out of a scientific struggle.	Yagamba nti UPC yava mu kuvuganya okwalimu ebibalo.
He said that all the issues that the Uganda People's Congress raised had all been discussed during the summit meetings and found to have no merit.	Yagamba nti ensonga zonna UPC ze yaleeta zaali zoogeddwako mu lukungaana era ne kizuulwa nti tezaalimu ggumba.
The Al-Shabaab struck Mogadishu on Aug 25 and threatened to overrun the presidential palace.	Aba Al-Shabaab baalumba ekibuga Mogadishu nga Agusito 25 era ne batiisatiisa okuwamba amaka g'obwa pulezidenti.
The onslaught continued until African Union peacekeepers, comprised of Ugandan and Burundians intervened to rescue the Somali government.	Embeera eyo yeeyongera okutuusa abasirikale b'ekibiina ekigatta amawanga ga Afirika omwali abasirikale ba Ugandan ne Burundi bwe baayingira mu nsonga okutaasa gavumenti ya Somali.
The AlShabaab extended the war theatre from Mogadishu to Kampala on July 11 and killed more than 76 people who were watching the World Cup finals.	Aba Al-Shabaab baagaziya eddwaniro lyabwe ne liba nga kati liva Mogadishu okutuukira ddala e Kampala era nga Jjulaayi 11 baakola obulumbaganyi mu Kampala ne batta abantu abasukka mu 76 abaali balaba empaka z'ekikopo ky'ensi yonna ez'akamalirizo.
When they finally met at Munyonyo Resort, they did not even just resolve, they vowed to send more peace keeping troops to Somalia.	Bwe baasisinkana e Munyonyo Resort, tebaasalawo busazi, naye baamalirira okwongera ku bajaasi be basindika e Somalia okukuuma emirembe.
More than a month after the pledge, the terrorists are still wreaking havoc in Somalia and even threatening to take over the interim government.	Nga wayise omwezi ogusukka mu gumu oluvannyuma lw'amawanga ago okukola obweyamo obwo, abatujju bakyatigomya Somalia era batiisatiisa n'okuwamba gavumenti ey'ekiseera.
In fact, if the Ugandan and Burundian troops did not intervene, probably there would be no government for African Union to protect in Mogadishu.	Mu butuufu, singa amaggye ga Uganda n'aga Burundi tegaayingira mu nsonga, oboolyawo wandibadde tewali gavumenti maggye g'amawanga amalala gye gandibadde geetaaga kukuuma mu Mogadishu.
What are the African Union member states who pledged troops to Somalia waiting for?	Kiki amawanga ga Afirika agaali geeyama okusinda amaggye mu Somalia kye galindirira?
Where are the troops you pledged for Mogadishu during the African Union summit in Kampala after  terror attacks?	Amaggye ge mweyama okusindika mu Mogadishu nga muli mu lukungaana lw'ekibiina ekigatta amawanga ga Afirika olwali mu Kampala oluvannyuma lw'obulumbaganyi bw'abatujju galiwa?
On 4th August 2010 Kenyans ratified a new constitution via a referendum, and they gave at least nominal support to devolution of political power in a way that isn’t really federalism.	Nga Agusito 4, 2010, Bannakenya baakola enkyukakyuka mu ssemateeka okuyitira mu referendamu era tebaawagira nnyo nsonga ya kuwaayo buyinza mu ngeri etali ya Federo.
Love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved.	Okwagala n'okutya tebitera kutambulira wamu, bwe tuba ab'okulondako kimu, kisingako okutiibwa okusinga okwagalibwa.
This is what happened on August 28 when a group of young people comprising mainly students were returning from a night club in Ntinda.	Kino kye kyaliwo nga Agusito 28 ekibinja ky'abavubuka abamu bwe kyali kiva mu kifo awasanyukirwa e Ntinda.
The African Union needs to get a little more serious and graduate from political rhetoric to political action.	Abali mu kibiina ekigatta amawanga ga Afirika basaanidde okukolera ku bye boogera mu kifo ky'okubyogerako obwogezi.
Federalism will not work in Uganda today for the same reason something similar just might work in Kenya.	Eky'okuba nti enkola eyeefananyiriza federo eyinza okukola mu Kenya tekitegeeza nti enkola ya federo esobola okukola mu Uganda leero.
The difference is that in Kenya there are powerful challengers to the authority of the state.	Enjawulo eriwo eri nti mu Kenya abawakanya gavumentii ba maanyi.
As pressure on the Kenyan government mounted, the government could have closed ranks to defend its power against honest businesses.	Akazito bwe keeyongera okuteekebwa ku gavumenti ya Kenya, gavumenti yandibadde yeegatta wamu n'abalala okukuuma obuyinza bw'erina ku bizineesi ezikolebwa mu bwesimbu.
In Uganda, by difference, there is almost no pressure on the centre to reform.	Mu Uganda, kumpi tewali kazito konna kasobola kuteekebwa ku gavumenti ya wakati kugireetera kukola nkyukakyuka.
The last experiment with giving real power to local government failed after ninteen ninty three.	Omulundi ogwasembayo okugezaako okuwa gavumenti z'ebitundu obuyinza obwa nnamaddala mu 1993 ebintu tebyatambula bulungi.
Until last year Kenya had two hundred fifty four districts but now has forty six.	Omwaka oguwedde we gwatuukira, Kenya yalina disitulikiti 254 naye kati erina 64.
The population of Kenya is about forty million people.	Abantu mu Kenya bali ng'obukadde 40.
Each of Kenya’s sixty four districts can thus muster an average of around one point four billion dollars.	Ekyo kitegeeza nti buli emu ku disitulikiti za Kenya 64 esobola okukungaanya doola akawumbi kamu mu obukadde bina.
But the point is that it was precisely this power which forced the new constitution through Kenya’s parliament in April.	Amaanyi ago ge gaasobozesa okusindiikiriza paliyamenti ya Kenya okuyisa ssemateeka omuggya mu Apuli.
It is different here in Uganda.	Kya njawulo mu Uganda.
Uganda has one hundred one districts with ten others waiting approval.	Uganda erina disitulikiti 101 era n'endala 10 zirindiridde kutongozebwa.
Uganda’s population is around thirty three million people.	Abantu mu Uganda bali ng'obukadde 33.
Those one hundred one districts account for about four hundred sixteen million dollars and three hundred twenty seven thousand people on average in economic and political power.	Disitulikiti ezo 101 zikozesa doola ng'obukadde 416 era okutwalira awamu zirimu abantu nga 327,000 abali mu by'obusuubuzi ne mu by'obufuzi.
It is easier to see how civil society in Uganda is less able to balance the power of the state than it is in Kenya.	Kyangu okulaba ensonga lwaki mu Uganda kizibu okukoma ku buyinza bwa gavumenti nga bwe kiri e Kenya.
This means that the most urgent task of the Ugandan federalist is not the winning of an election.	Ekyo kitegeeza nti omulimu ogusinga obukulu Bannayuganda abaagala federo gwe balina si gwa kuwangula kalulu.
State House is strong enough to push Parliament to do its' bidding.	Pulezidenti alina obuyinza bungi ne kiba nti asobola okuleetera paliyamenti okusalawo nga bw'ayagala.
There is six point five percent inflation adjusted economic growth.	Eby'enfuna bikulira ku bitundu mukaaga n'obutundutundu butaano ku buli kikumi.
That so little of this benefits the starving farmers of Kotido or the struggling shopkeepers of Fort Portal.	Ekyo kiganyula kitono abalimi abayala abali mu Kotido oba abatunda mu dduuka abaavu abali e Fort Portal.
A serious devolution of power similar to but more complete than the efforts of the ninteen ninty three Decentralisation Programme.	Okuwaayo obuyinza mu bujjuvu, so si nga bwe kyali mu 1993.

Why federalism can work in Kenya but fail in Uganda by Andrew M.	Lwaki federo esobola okukola mu Kenya naye n'egaana mu Uganda, kyawandiikibwa Andrew M.
The judgment marked a major and symbolic watershed in Uganda’s democratisation process.	Ekyasalibwawo kyalaga nti waaliwo enkyukakyuka ey'amaanyi mu lugendo lwa Uganda olwa demokulasiya.
For almost a century, the law of rebellion has been used by successive regimes in Uganda to stifle free speech.	Okumala emyaka nga 100, etteeka erikwata ku kujeemera gavumenti libadde likozesebwa abakulembeze mu Uganda okumalako abantu eddembe ly'okwogera.
Uganda have continually retreated to this law to stifle democratic expression in this country.	Abakulembeze mu Uganda bazze beekwasa etteeka lino okumalako abantu mu ggwanga eddembe ly'okwogera.
The main celebrants of the judgment were journalists because we have born the biggest brunt of this law.	Abaasinga okusanyukira okusalawo okwo baali bannamawulire kubanga be basinze okunyigirizibwa etteeka eryo.
The Nataional Resistance Movement government and President Yoweri Museveni specifically should celebrate too.	Gavumenti ya NRM ne Pulezidenti Yoweri Museveni nabo ekyo basaanidde okukisanyukira ennyo.
In Uganda, the president is not born but elected.	Mu Uganda, omuntu tazaalibwa nga pulezidenti naye alondebwa bulondebwa.
The cancellation of the law by the courts was a major national news item and was carried on all major news networks across the world.	Kooti okusazzaamu etteeka eryo gaali mawulire ga maanyi mu ggwanga lyonna ne ku mikutu gy'amawulire egy'amaanyi mu nsi yonna.
The National Resistance Movement should have taken this credit by arguing that it has established independent courts that are actively promoting democracy.	NRM yali esobola okwewaana olw'ekyo ekyaliwo ng'egamba nti ye yassaawo kooti z'amateeka ezeetengeredde ezitumbula demokulasiya.
But it reflects the National Resistance Movement  in the light as a regime hold onto an anti-democratic colonial relic.	Naye ekyo kiraga nti gavumenti ya NRM ekyatambulira mu bigere bya gavumenti endala ezizze zitatambulira ku nkola ya demokulasiya.
Going to court to challenge certain laws that are inconsistent with the constitution publicized in ninteen nity five.	Okugenda mu kooti okuwakanya amateeka agamu agatakwatagana na ssemateeka wa 1995.
We were only helping advance the nation-building process apparently set in motion by the National Resistance Movement.	Twali tuyambako buyambi mu kaweefube ow'okuzimba eggwanga ayinza okuba nga yatandikibwa NRA.
Therefore the National Resistance Movement government should have joined journalists to celebrate the victory.	N'olwekyo aba NRM bandibadde beegatta ku bannamawulire okujjaguza obuwanguzi obwali butuukiddwako.
Since it came to office, the National Resistance Movement has not abolish a single anti-democratic law.	Okuva lwe yajja mu buyinza, gavumenti ya NRM teggyangawo wadde etteeka erimu eritali lya dimokulasiya.
Yet overall, the National Resistance Movement is fighting yesterday’s war.	Naye ate okutwalira wamu, NRM erwana ntalo za mabega.
For increasingly, newspapers are dying in Uganda.	Empapula z'amawulire zifaafaaganira mu Uganda.
However, since Uganda was connected by fiber-optic cable to the ocean, the technological foundation of a free media is uniting.	Kyokka okuva Uganda lwe yayungibwa ku layini za fiber-optic eziyita mu guyanja, kyongedde okuwa bannamawulire eddembe okuyitira mu tekinologiya.
First, over half a million Ugandans are visiting the internet daily.	Ekisooka, Bannayuganda abasukka mu mitwalo ataano bakozesa Intaneeti buli lunaku.
By two thousand fifteen, internet access is going to cost only five percent of its two thousand five price.	Omwaka gwa 2015 ebisale bya Intaneeti  bijja kuba biri ebitundu bitaano ku buli kikumi byokka eby'ebisale bya Intaneeti mu 2005.
The reduction of technology would double the performance at half the price, giving technological innovation a price performance ratio of one to four.	Okukendeeza ku bunene bw'ebyuma bya tekinologiya kijja kwongera ku sipiidi kwe bikolera ate nga bigula ssente ntonoko.
From this perspective, an iPad that costs one thousand five hundred dollars  today will sell for less than ninty four dollars in two thousand forteen.	Ekyo kiba kitegeeza nti iPad egula doola 1,500 leero ejja kuba egulwa doola ezitasukka 94 mu 2014.
As I write, Uganda has over eleven million mobile phone lines sold.	We mpandiikira bino, layini z'essimu ezaakatundibwa mu Uganda zisukka mu bukadde 11.
Since many people have more than one line, we can cut price three million lines.	Okuva bwe kiri nti abantu bangi balina layini ezisukka mu emu, tusobola okusala bbeeyi ya layini obukadde busatu.
This leaves eight million Ugandans with a mobile line.	Ekyo kiba kitegeeza nti Bannayuganda obukadde munaana baba ne layini y'essimu.
The adult population of Uganda is only thirteen million (out of thirty two people).	Abantu abakulu mu Uganda bali obukadde 13 (babiri ku buli bantu asatu mu babiri).
The ability to send tonnes of data through cyber space in a second  is impossible.	Tekisobokka kusindika data wa Intaneeti n'emikutu gy'empuliziganya emirala mu butikitiki butono.
Uganda was producing only two thousand university graduates per year in ninteen ninty four (when I joined Makerere).	Mu 1994 (we nnagendera e Makerere) Uganda yali ettikkira abayizi ba yunivasite 2,000 bokka buli mwaka.
Indeed, the number of young Ugandans already hooked on Facebook and Twitter is growing every night and the debate on blogs is bloody.	Mu butuufu, buli lukya omuwendo gwa Bannayuganda abavubuka abeegatta ku Facebook ne Twitter gweyongera era kati babbulooga bangi.
Most “intellectuals” in Africa have remained blind to these structural changes taking place before our own eyes.	Enkyukakyuka eno egenda mu maaso, “abayivu” bangi mu Afirika bagibuusizza amaaso.
We were only helping advance the modernize process apparently set in motion by the National Resistance Movement.	Twali tugezaako kuyambako mu kutwala mu maaso mulamwa ogw'okuleetawo enkulaakulana oguyinza okuba nga gwatandikibwa NRM.
Therefore the National Resistance Movement government should have joined journalists to celebrate the victory.	N'olwekyo, aba NRM bandibadde beegatta ku bannamawulire okujaganya obuwanguzi obwali butuukiddwako.
On the morning of August twenty fifth, two thousand ten a dozen or so journalists screamed into the registrar’s gloomy basement office. 	Ku makya nga Agusito 25, 2010 bannamawulire nga 12 n'omusobyo baakubira enduulu mu ofiisi ya registrar.
This is because a High Court ruling in September two thousand nine abolished the creation of two hundred eight districts after ninteen ninty two, claiming there was no constitutional basis for it.	Ekyo kyava ku kuba nti mu Ssebutemba 2009, Kooti Enkulu yagaana eky'okuteekawo disitulikizi 208 oluvannyuma lwa 1992, ng'egamba nti tewali we basinziira mu ssemateeka kukikola.
Its Gross Domestic Product at Purchasing Power Parity is about sixty three point five billion dollars or one thousand six hundred dollars per head per year.	Ensaasaanya ku bintu eri doola ng'obuwumbi mukaaga n'ekitundu oba doola lukumi mu lukaaga buli muntu buli mwaka.
And eight hundred sixty nine people in economic and political power.	Era abantu 869 balina obuyinza mu by'obusuubizi ne mu by'obufuzi.
Through the referen-dum in August.	Okuyitira mu referendamu mu Agusito.
They support a Gross Domestic Product at Purchasing Power Parity of about forty three point two billion dollars or one thousand three hundred dollars per person annually.	Bayambako mu nsaasaanya ku bintu ya doola obuwumbi ana mu busatu mu obukadde bibiri oba doola lukumi mu bisatu buli muntu buli mwaka.
When you also consider that for almost three decades the power of religious, ethnic and cultural institutions was systematically opressed here instead of manipulated openly as in Kenya.	Era bw'olowooza ku ky'okuba nti okumala emyaka ng'asatu, amaanyi agali mu ddiini ne mu by'obuwangwa gaatuulwako mu kifo ky'okugeeyambisa nga bwe kiri mu Kenya.
Or writing of a new constitution but economic development outside of Kampala.	Oba okuwandiika ssemateeka omupya akwata ku nkulaakulana mu by'enfuna mu bitundu ebiri wabweru wa Kampala.
And in Uganda we have a long way to go before the districts can make the centre feel their muscle.	Era mu Uganda disitulikiti zikyalina olugendo luwanvu gavumenti ya wakati okutandika okuwulira amaanyi gaazo.
In Uganda’s case, where around thirty five percent of the population lives in official poverty and where eighty percent scratches a living from subsistence agriculture.	Mu Uganda abantu 35 ku buli kikumi baavu era 8 ku buli kikumi babeerawo ku mmere gye beerimira.
There are great expectations that oil revenues will push growth higher as soon as two thousand twelve.	Bangi basuubira nti ssente ezinaggibwa mu mafuta zijja kuleetawo enkulaakulana ya maanyi omwaka gwa 2012 we gunaatuukira.
This is a symptom that there is not anyone or anything outside the centre which can force government to forego the purchase of  Russian fighter jets and apply greater effort to food security and population growth problems.	Ekyo kiraga nti tewali kisobola kulemesa gavumenti kugula nnyonyi ennwanyi kuva ku Russia ssente ezo ezikozese okugonjoola ekizibu ky'ebbula y'emmere ne ku kulinnya kw'omuwendo gw'abantu.
Although introduced by the colonial state to suppress African demands for independence, post independence governments.	Wadde nga byassibwawo amawanga agaalina amatwale okulemesa amawanga ga Afirika okufuna obwetwaze.
The victors included opposition politicians and the people of Uganda generally.	Mu bafunyeemu mwe muli ab'oludda oluvuganya gavumenti ne Bannayuganda okutwalira awamu.
This could be so because of the political environment the National Resistance Movement government and Museveni have created.	Ekyo kiri kityo olw'embeera y'eby'obufuzi NRM ne Museveni gye bassizzaawo.
It was in the suit Charles Onyango Obbo and I won in two thousand three.	Eno ye mbeera nze ne Charles Onyango Obbo mwe twawangulira mu 2003.
A pursuit of the National Resistance Movement nation-building programme.	Okulondoola enteekateeka ya NRM ey'okuzimba eggwanga.
This is played by National Resistance Movement in trying to retain power in Uganda.	Kano kazannyo ka NRM okusobola okwekuumira mu buyinza.
A committee of such men as Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin and Idi Amin would even find a child harsh.	Ekigambo kyonna ekyayogerwa abasajja nga Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin ne Idi Amin tekitwalibwa bulungi.
The combined circulation of New Vision and Daily Monitor has declined by about twenty percent since ninteen ninty seven in spite of a big boom in education and increasing size of upper and middle classes.	Okutwalira awamu, omuwendo gw'empapula z'amawulire olwa New Vision ne Daily Monitor ezibunyisibwa gukendedde ebitundu nga 20 ku buli kikumi okuva mu 1997 wadde nga kati omuwendo gw'abantu abasomye n'abalina ssente ensaamusaamu gweyongedde.
Gordon Moore (Intel’s found-ing Chief Executive Officer) argued in the ninteen sixty's that it would happen after every two years.	Mu myaka gya 1960, Gordon Moore (CEO wa Intel’s found-ing) yagamba nti ekyo kya kubangawo buli luvannyuma lwa myaka ebiri.
Sixty two percent of our adult population is curved onto the mobile phone that is, modern technology.	Nkaaga ku buli kikumi ku bantu abakulu mu ggwanga obulamu bwabwe butambulira ku ssimu, tekinologiya ali ku mulembe.

This is when the East African Media Institute and I took the sedition matter to court.	Mu kiseera ekyo nze ne East African Media Institute lwe twatwala ensonga y'okukuma mu bantu omuliro mu kkooti.
This was at the Court of Appeals on Parliament Avenue in the hope of witnessing history.	Wano nga tuli ku Kooti ejulirwamu okuliraana paliyamenti nga tusuubira okulaba ekyafaayo.
In a shy, quiet voice began reading the summation of the petition that had been filed almost five years prior by journalists Andrew Mwenda and Haruna Kanaabi, represented by the Eastern African Media Institute.

The National Resistance Movement  has not met these legal requirements, but so are other political parties.	NRM tennatuukiriza bisaanyizo ebyo eby'omu mateeka, naye n'ebibiina by'obufuzi ebirala tebibituukiriza.
National Resistance Movement party is not officially funded by the government like in the case in Tanzania and South Africa where parties have business subsidiaries which generate revenue.

The lecturers vowed not to resume their duties until National Insurance Corporation  pays them their earned savings.	Abasomesa ba yunivasite beeyama obutaddamu kukola mirimu okutuusa ng'ekitongole kya National Insurance Corporation kibasasudde ssente zaabwe.
Even at the duress of a gun we are not going back to work without our money,” said Tanga Odoi, chairman of Makerere University Academic Staff Association.

Five billion, which they saved with the national insurer between nineteen ninety six and two thuosand five.	Obuwumbi butaano bwe baateresa National Insurance wakati wa 1996 ne 2005.
This is not the first time a strike is frustrating Makerere University.	Guno si gwe mulundi ogwali gusoose abasomesa ba yunivasite y'e Makerere okwediima.
There have been many strikes by both lecturers and students at the eighty eight year old institution.	Wabaddewo okwekalakaasa kw'abasomesa n'abayizi okutali kumu ku yunivasite eno emaze emyaka 88.
Strikes were reminders to the administration that hey this is our University,says Mugisha from campus.	Mugisha, omuyizi ku yunivasite, agamba nti, kino kyabadde kijjukiza abakulembera yunivasite nti eno yunivasite yaffe.
I also suffered a lot in two thuosand six and two thuosand eight when I was doing my masters at the University.	Era nabonaabona nnyo mu 2006 ne mu 2008 bwe nnali nsoma emisomo gyange egya Masita ku yunivasite.
The lecturers laid down their tools because of poor pay and we never had classes for close to a month.	Abasomesa baalekera awo okusomesa nga bagamba nti tebabasasula bulungi era twamala omwezi nga gumu nga tetusoma.
Doctor George Lugalambi, the head of the Mass communication department at the university.	Dokita George Lugalambi, akulira ekitongole kya Mass Communication ku yunivasite y'e Makerere.
Makerere is a big institution and people feel that they can make a point out there by laying down their tools, he says.	Bagamba nti, yunivasite y'e Makerere nnene era nti kyangu okuleetera abalala okubaako kye bakolawo singa abakozi baayo bassa wansi ebikola.
Unlike before when President Museveni could not intervene in staff issues, now he has.	Obutafaananako bwe kyali emabega nga Pulezideni Museveni tayingira mu nsonga z'abakozi, ennaku zino aziyingiramu.
This time around President Museveni, in a letter to the Makerere staff dated august twenty sixth, asked the lecturers to resume teaching.	Ku mulundi guno Pulezidenti Museveni yawandiikira Makerere ebbaluwa nga Agusito 26, n'alagira abasomesa okuddamu okusomesa.
Staff members were defiant to suspend the strike questioning the seriousness of the president’s guarantee.	Abasomesa baagaana okuddamu okusomesa nga tebakakasa nti pulezidenti bye yali abasuubizza yali abitegeeza.
Let us unanimously suspend the strike President’s intervention buys three months for a solution to contested NIC payments.	Ka tuyimirize akeediimo kubanga pulezidenti okuyingira mu nsonga zino kiwa gavumenti ebbanga lya myezi esatu okulaba eky'okukola abasomesa bafune ssente za NIC ze baagala.
Jimmy Siya staff members were defiant to suspend the strike questioning the seriousness of the president’s guarantee.	Jimmy Siya agamba nti abasomesa baagaana okusazaamu akeediimo olw'okuba baali tebakakasa obanga ebyo pulezidenti bye yali asuubiza byali bituufu.
Give little time to the auditor general and update the president as the president deals with National Insurance Corporation  as he requested, said Odoi.	Odoi yagamba nti basaanidde okuwa auditor genero akaseera katono era basaanidde okutegeezanga pulezidenti wa ebintu we bituuse ng'eno pulezidenti bw'akwatagana n'ekitongole kya NIC nga bwe yasuubizza.
The lecturers agreed to convene after three months to decide on whether to lay down their tools again.	Abasomesa bakkiriziganya okusisinkana oluvannyuma lw'emyezi esatu balabe obanga baddamu okussa wansi ebikola.
We will use it again if we do not get our money,” said a professor from the chemistry department.	"Polofeesa okuva mu kitongole kya ssaayansi yagamba nti, ""Tujja kuddamu twediime singa tetusasulwa.”"
Earlier this year staff members announced a strike only to suspend it again after Makerere’s Vice Chancellor.	Ku ntandikwa y'omwaka guno abasomesa baalangirira akeediimo naye ne bakasazaamu oluvannyuma lw'akulira ettendekero lya Makerere.
Venansius Baryamureeba, convinced the staff members that president Museveni would attend the fifty seventh graduation and would address their grievances in his speech.	Venansius Baryamureeba, bwe yakakasa abasomesa nti pulezidenti Museveni ajja kubaawo ku matikkira ag'omulundi ogwa makumi attaano mu musaanvu ayogere ku ebyo ebibaluma.
However, in the end the president did not attend the graduation.	Naye pulezidenti teyagenda ku matikkira.
Secondly, top university officials, including the Vice Chancellor, were working around the clock .	Eky'okubiri, abakulu mu yunivasite omwali n'akulira yunivasite baali bakola butaweera, misana na kiro.
The Vice Chancellor was hopeful that the president would assist them financially to develop certain projects such as their Kololo land.	Akulira yunivasite yali asuubira nti pulezidenti yali ajja kubayamba mu by'ensimbi basobole okukola ku projekiti zaabwe gamba ng'eyo ey'oku ttaka lyabwe ery'e Kololo.
President Museveni had previously given shillings four.	Emabegako Pulezidenti Museveni yali awaddeyo ssente [……]
Five billion to the Faculty of Food Science and Technology after visiting the faculty on October second,  two thuosand nine.	Obuwumbi butaano eri ekitongole kya yunivasite ekya ssaayansi ne tekinologiya oluvannyuma lw'okukirambula nga Okitobba 2, 2009.
Despite having a big stake , makerere officials have been neglected by National Insurance Corporation, which has triggered more questions .	Wadde nga bakola omulimu mukulu nnyo, abakozi ba Makerere babuusiddwa nnyo amaaso ekitongole kya NIC, era ekyo kireeseewo ebibuuzo bingi.
A lecturer who preferred not to be identified told the Independent that keeping Makerere University running is not an easy task and that such strikes help put things right.	Omu ku basomesa ataayagadde kwatuukirizibwa mannya yagamba olupapula lwa Independent nti omulimu gw'okuddukanya yunivasite y'e Makerere si mwangu, era nti obwediimo ng'obwo buyamba mu kutereeza ebintu.
Those who say that lecturers are striking all the time should know that strikes are a negotiating tool.	Abo abagamba nti abasomesa beediima buli kiseera basaanidde okukimanya nti okwediima y'emu ku ngeri abantu gye bayitamu okutuuka ku kukkiriziganya.
You have such a big university that is not paid attention to by a government that claims to have education in its priorities.	Mulina yunivasite ennene bw'etyo gavumenti gy'etefaako kyokka ng'egamba nti efaayo nnyo ku byenjigiriza.
For instance, how else would the president have decided to pay attention to our troubles?	Mulowooza kiki ekirala ekyandireetedde pulezidenti okufaayo ku bituluma?
He adds that despite being the biggest university in Uganda, Makerere has meagre funds which can not satisfy all its needs.	Agattako nti, wadde nga Makerere ye yunivasite esingayo obunene mu Uganda, obusente obugiweebwa butono era nti tebusobola kukola ku byetaago byayo.
When Nuwagaba was chairman of  constitution of the Makerere University Academic Staff Association  the lecturers laid down their tools.	Nuwagaba bwe yali nga ye ssentebe wa ssemateeka afuga ekibiina ekigatta abasomesa ba Makerere yunivasite, abasomesa beediima.
Doctor Saul Nsubuga says that strikes are mainly caused by the University council which makes poor policies all the time.	Dokita Saul Nsubuga agamba nti obwediimo buva ku kakiiko ka yunivasite akasalawo obubi buli kiseera.
It is for instance the council that made us fall into this National Insurance Corporation problem and now they are not solving it.	Ng'ekyokulabirako, ab'akakiiko kano be baatuleetera okugwa mu buzibu bwa NIC naye ate ekizibu ekyo kibalemye okugonjoola.
Nsubuga is not the first to blame the university council.	Nsubuga si ye yasooka okunenya akakiiko ka yunivasite.
In the meeting at the university hall on August twenty seventh, lecturers after  blamed the university council for their problems.	Oluvannyuma lw'olukungaana olwali ku university hall nga Agusito 27, abasomesa baanenya akakiiko ka yunivasite olw'ebizibu bye baalimu.
In fact one staff member took to the podium before the meeting started and requested that the council chairman Mathew Rukikaire be voted out of office.	Mu butuufu omu ku bakozi ba yunivasite yagenda ku katuuti ng'olukungaana terunnatandika n'asaba nti ssentebe w'akakiiko ako Mathew Rukikaire agibweko ofiisi ye.
Members we are tired of this mess, our council has failed us and I request for a vote of no confidence in the council chairman right here and now.	Bannange tukooye obuvuyo buno, akakiiko kaffe katuyiyeeyo era nsaba mu kiseera kino tukube akalulu akajja obwesige mu ssentebe w'akakiiko kano.
Doctor Odoi and other executive members of The constitution of the Makerere University Academic Staff Association  had earlier told a press briefing at the university guest house.	Dokita Odoi n'abalala abavunaanyizibwa ku ssemateeka afuga ekibiina ekigatta abasomesa ba yunivasite y'e Makerere baali basoose kwogerako ne bannamawulire ku university guest house.
We are in mourning that the council chairman can praise National Insurance Corporation  for promising to pay arrears.	Kitunakuwazza nnyo ssentebe w'akakiiko kaffe okutendereza NIC olw'okusuubiza okusasula ssente zaffe ezirina okuba nga zaatuweebwa dda.
However, Odoi later apologised and said that the council chairman had called him and clarified that he had no interests in National Insurance Corporation.	Naye oluvannyuma Odoi yeetonda n'agamba nti ssentebe w'akakiiko yali amukubidde essimu n'amutegeeza nti teyalina bye yeenoonyeza mu NIC.
Yet despite Odoi’s apology, staff members insist that the university council is the root cause of all problems and strikes.	Wadde nga Odoi yeetonda, abasomesa bakyagamba nti akakiiko ka yunivasite ke kaviiriddeko ebizibu n'obwediimo ebiri mu yunivasite.
Whether or not National Insurance Corporation clears the staffs’ savings remains unclear.	Tekinnaba kumanyibwa obanga aba NIC banaasasula oba tebaasasule ssente z'abasomesa ba yunivasite.
But as the staff members deliberated on the resolution after receiving the president’s letter.	Naye abasomesa bwe baali bakyayogera ku ky'okuzzaako oluvannyuma lw'okufuna ebbaluwa okuva ewa pulezidenti.
If their money is not paid, it is clear that these Makerereans are more than ready to plunge the institution into yet another strike come November.	Kyeyoleka lwatu nti singa tebasasulwa ssente zaabwe, abasomesa ba Makerere baali beetegefu okuddamu okwediima mu Noovemba.
Tanga Odoi, President Museveni was told by Mwenda: You have won the election by ninety three percent.	Tanga Odoi, Mwenda yagamba Pulezidenti Museveni nti: Akalulu omaze okukawangula n'ebitundu 93 ku buli kikumi.
Normally it is in Saddam Hussein’s Iraq that a presidential candidate gets such a figure.	Ekya pulezidenti okufuna obululu obungi bwe butyo okisanga mu Iraq ku mulembe gwa Saddam Hussein.
Kagame,  well in some of those places elections have not been taking place at all.	Kagame, mu bimu ng'ebyo tewabaddengayo kulonda wadde.
Many of them are represented in parliament.	Bangi ku bo bakiikirirwa mu paliyamenti.
Just sixteen years ago nothing existed, even human life was at stake in Rwanda, no institutions, absolutely nothing.	Emyaka 16 emabega tewaali kintu, n'obulamu bw'abantu bwali mu matigga mu Rwanda, tewaali masomero, tewaali yadde.
This is what operates in the minds of the people here; they have got a cow from Kagame, and the Rwandan Patriotic Front.	Kino kye kiri mu birowoozo by'abantu wano; baafuna ente okuva ewa Kagame, era okuva mu kibiina kya Rwandan Patriotic Front.
But there have been concerns expressed in the international media by international human rights groups saying look; in the run up President Kagame created an atmosphere of fear.	Naye wabaddewo okwemulugunya ku mikutu gy'amawulire okwetoola ensi okuva eri ebitongole ebirwanirira eddembe ly'obuntu nga bigamba nti; akalulu bwe kaali tekannakubwa Pulezidenti Kagame yateekawo embeera etiisa abantu.
Mwenda, hosted President Paul Kagame of Rwanda on a radio show on Contact FM in Kigali, a day after the voting in that country’s presidential election.	Mwenda, yakyaza Pulezidenti Paul Kagame owa Rwanda ku programu emu eya leediyo ya Contact FM mu Kigali, nga wayise olunaku lumu oluvannyuma lw'okulonda pulezidenti okugwa.
Mwenda had started the show titled “Rwanda Decides” to promote public debate about the election in the country.	Mwenda yali atandiseewo programu eyitibwa “Rwanda Esalawo” okuwa abantu akakisa okuwa endowooza zaabwe ku kulonda mu Rwanda.
Kagame speaks about his election victory, claims on political repression like ours, it will simply  happen.	Kagame ayogera ku buwanguzi bwe yali atuuseeko, ku bigambibwa nti yatiisatiisa abantu, n'ekyali kigenda okuddakko.
The story they want to believe is that there is no democracy in Rwanda, that there is repression, and so forth.	Baagala okukkiriza nti mu Rwanda temuli demokulasiya, nti abantu banyigirizibwa, n'ebirala.
For example, if you look at the case of the journalist who was killed here, the police investigated the case and the one who killed the journalist was arrested.	Ng'ekyokulabirako, bw'olowooza ku munnamawulire eyattirwa wano, poliisi yakinoonyerezaako era oyo eyamutta n'akwatibwa.
The Electoral Commission may apply to the High Court for an order to deregister the political party or organisation,” reads section nine part six of the Act.	"Mu kitundu eky'omwenda akawaayiro ak'omukaaga mu ssemateeka wagamba nti, ""Ekitongole ky'eby'okulonda kisobola okuwandiikira Kooti Enkulu okuwanduukulula ekibiina ky'eby'obufuzi oba ekibiina kyonna."""
The court prescribes the mode of disposal of the party’s assets, rights and liabilities.	Kooti eraga engeri ebintu by'ekibiina gye bigenda okuggibwawo, ebisaanidde n'ebitasaanidde kukolebwa.
Funding from the government on the basis of their numerical strength in parliament Daudi Migereko ,Kirunda Kivejinja ,Jim Muhwezi ,Mike Mukula ,Kabakumba Masiko. 	Okuweebwa ssente za gavumenti okusinziira ku muwendo gw'abakiise baabwe mu lukiiko olukulu olw'eggwanga, Daudi Migereko, Kirunda Kivejinja, Jim Muhwezi, Mike Mukula, Kabakumba Masiko.
When National Insurance Corporation operated a pension scheme for the institution.	Ekitongole kya NIC bwe kyaterekanga pensoni z'abakozi ba yunivasite.
The reoccurrence of strikes at Makerere is mainly because of the nature of the institution.	Obwediimo obutatadde obuli e Makerere okusingira ddala buva ku ntegeka ya yunivasite eyo.
Then deal with the proprietors of National Insurance Corporation and managers as we did in the case of green bank,reads the president’s letter.	Ebbaluwa ya pulezidenti yagamba nti, Bannanyini NIC n'abagiddukanya basaanidde okukwatibwa mu ngeri y'emu gye baakwatamu aba bbanka ya Green.
Later resolved to suspend the strike for three months and wait for the auditor general to audit the funds in question as the president directed.	Oluvannyuma musalewo okuyimiriza akeediimo okumala emyezi esatu mulindirire auditor genero abalirire ssente ezivuddeko embetezi nga pulezidenti bwe yalagidde.
Back to class for now  student crosses at the closed faculty of social science Makerere university during the Lecturers strike on August twenty seventh.	Bazzeemuko okusoma omuyizi ayita ku kizimbe kya Faculty of Social Science Makerere University ng'abasomesa bakyediimye nga Agusito 27.
Later resolved to suspend the strike for three months and wait for the auditor general to audit the funds in question as the president directed.	Oluvannyuma basalawo okuyimiriza akeediimo okumala emyezi esatu balindirire auditor genero okubalirira ssente ezaali zivuddeko embetezi nga pulezidenti bwe yali alagidde.
Amend staff relations with the government that have been strained for a long time on account of lecturers being perceived as anti-National Resistance Movement.	Okuzzaawo enkolagana wakati w'abasomesa ne gavumenti eyonoonese olw'abasomesa okutwalibwa ng'abawakanya NRM.
The corporation has managed to neglect over two thousand staff members at the country’s most respected university.	Ekitongole tekifuddeeyo ku bakozi abasukka mu nkumi bbiri aba yunivasite y'eggwanga esinga okussibwamu ekitiibwa.
Professor Augustus Nuwagaba, a former constitution of the Makerere University Academic Staff Association  chairman who led many lecturer’s strikes.	Polofesa Augustus Nuwagaba, eyaliko ssentebe w'ekibiina ekigatta abasomesa b'e Makerere era eyakulemberamu obwediimo bw'abasomesa obuwerako.
Said a staff member who could only be identified as Grace, amidst applause.	Bw'ati omu ku bakozi eyamanyidwako erinnya limu erya Grace bwe yayogedde, wakati mu mizira.
That they have started doubting whether the council chairman was working for the university or National Insurance Corporation as he seems to praise National Insurance Corporation  all the time.	Batandise okubuusabuusa obanga ssentebe w'akakiiko yali akolera yunivasite oba NIC kubanga kirabika buli kiseera aba mu kutendereza NIC.
We are known for after sales service and genuine spare parts Snowmans Centre, Plot eighty nine, seventh Street, Industrial Area, Kampala.	Tuyamba mu kutunda ebintu era tutunda sipeeya mu Snowmans Centre, ku Plot eighty nine, ku seventh Street, mu Industrial Area, e Kampala.
That is how the Rwandan Patriotic Front and Kagame have gained the confidence of the people.	Bwe batyo aba RPF ne Kagame bwe bafuuse abaganzi mu abantu.
A leading opposition politician was killed, a journalist who was investigating a story here was killed, a major and powerful political party called the Green Party was blocked from registration.	Omu ku bavuganya ennyo gavumenti yattibwa, munnamawulire eyalina ensonga gy'alondoola wano yattibwa, ekibiina ky'obufuzi eky'amaanyi ekya Green Party kyagaanibwa okwewandiisa.
The weapon that was used has been retrieved and the killer has admitted to committing the crime and given reasons why he did so.	Ekissi kye yakozesa kyafunibwa era eyamutta yakkiriza nti ye yazza omusango ogwo era n'awa n'ensonga lwaki yamutta.
Haggai Matsiko Emanuel Elamoit, an international relations masters student at Makerere University, is a sad man.	Haggai Matsiko Emanuel Elamoit, asoma diguli eya masita mu nkolagana z'amawanga e Makerere alina ennaku ku mutima.
The Rwandan Patriotic Front and Kagame have managed to reconstruct the country, to bring normalcy to the country, to bring back value to human life, to the people of Rwanda and through social and economic transformation, people’s lives have totally changed.	Aba RPF ne Kagame basobodde okuddamu okuzimba eggwanga, okuleetawo obutebenkemu mu ggwanga, okuleetera abantu okuwulira nga ba mugaso, era baleeseewo enkyukakyuka ez'omuggundu mu mbeera z'abantu ne mu by'enfuna mu Rwanda.
A candidate who had potential to challenge Kagame and defeat Kagame called Victoire Ngabire was arrested and charged with divisionism.	Victoire Ngabire eyali asobola okuvuganya era n'awangula Kagame yakwatibwa era n'avunaanibwa ogw'okuleetawo enjawukana mu ggwanga.
He is well known and also a former soldier under President Juvenal, Habyarimana regime.	Amanyiddwa nnyo era yali musirikale ku mulembe gwa Pulezidenti Juvenal, Habyarimana.
Although Mr President, assuming your critics say that this guy who was arrested and confessed to the murder, is just a ploy by President Kagame and his government to just create a lie, the boy will be in jail for just a few months and when the story cools down, he will be released from prison.	Naye Pulezidenti, singa abakuvumirira bagamba nti omusajja oyo eyakwatibwa n'akkiriza okuba nga ye yatta, yagulirirwa Pulezidenti Kagame ne gavumenti ye okulimba abantu era nti ajja kusibbwa okumala emyezi mitono era oluvannyuma ateebwe ng'ebintu abantu babivuddeko.
The candidate was very well known, a critic of President Kagame and he was killed in the runup to the election	Omusajja oyo yali amanyiddwa nnyo, ng'avumirira Pulezidenti Kagame, era n'attibwa ng'ebula ennaku ntono okulonda kubeewo.
In fact, this man was not the leader of the Green Party.	Ekituufu kiri nti, omusajja ono si ye yali akulira ekibiina kya Green Party.
The leader of the Green Party is Habineza, not Kagwa Rwisereka who was unfortunately killed.	Habineza y'akulira ekibiina kya Green Party, so si Kagwa Rwisereka eyattibwa.
He is said to have been in the leadership of the Green Party.	Agambibwa okuba nga y'omu ku baali bakulembera ekibiina kya Green Party.
Rwisereka lived in the Southern province, in the university town of Butare.	Rwisereka yali abeera mu kitundu eky'ebukiikaddyo, mu kabuga k'e Butare awali yunivasite.
But of course the media there now blows things out of proportion,  claiming this is somebody who had capacity to defeat Kagame in the election.	Naye tekyewuunyisa nti bannamawulire abali eyo kati basavuwaza ebintu, nga bagamba nti omusajja ono yali asobola okuwangula Kagame mu kalulu.
He was not even known in his home town of Butare itself.	Yali tamanyiddwa na mu kabuga k'ewaabwe ak'e Butare.
"""Okay, why did you refuse to reg-ister their party?"" Mwenda asks."	" Mwenda amubuuza nti, ""Kati olwo lwaki mwagaana okuwandiisa ekibiina kyabwe?"""
This is how all these parties were registered including the Rwanda Political Front.	Ebibiina byonna nga mw'otwalidde n'ekya RPF by'ayita mu mitendera gye gimu egyo okuwandiisibwa.
In the Green Party, they failed to do that.	Ab'ekibiina kya Green Party ekyo baalemererwa okukikola.
At some point, the leaders of the Green Party went to Kampala, Uganda.	Waliwo ekiseera lwe kyatuuka abakulembeze ba Green ne bagenda e Kampala, mu Uganda.
There was a meeting for the leaders of all the Green Parties in the whole of Africa and they met in Kampala.	Abakulembeze b'ebibiina byonna ebya Green Party mu Afirika baalina olukungaana era baalufunira Kampala.
So you were not afraid of the Green Party?	Kitegeeza nti wali totidde kibiina kya Green Party?
The President has a problem in the Rwanda Political Front then.	Kati olwo Pulezidenti alina obuzibu mu RPF.
If things happen like this, the international media covers a story and the Rwanda Political Front and the Rwandan government are unable to put forth this explanation you have given me.	Singa ebintu bwe biti bibaawo, bannamawulire mu nsi yonna ne boogera ku bibaddewo era RPF ne gavumenti ya Rwanda ne batawa kunnyonnyola nga kw'ompadde.
The international press, have prejudice, or even really contempt about Africa, about Rwanda, about these developing countries.	Bannamawulire b'ebweru balina obusosoze, era oboolyawo n'obukyayi ku Afirika, ku Rwanda, ku mawanga gano agakyakula.
They consider themselves the do gooders for Africa.	Balowooza nti be bamanyi engeri Afirika gy'erina okuddukanyizibwamu obulungi.
So they imagine whenever Africans are hungry, we feed them.	Balowooza nti buli Afirika bw'erumwa enjala, ffe tugiwa emmere.
They think Rwandans have to keep quiet and they will tell us what to do and what not to do.	Balowooza nti Abanyarwanda balina kusirika busirisi bo ne bababuulira eky'okukola ne kye batalina kukola.
Some of these countries where these journalists operate from have been responsible for the disasters that have taken place in our countries including the genocide in Rwanda.	Agamu  ku mawanga bannamawulire abo gye bakolera ge gavunaanyizibwa ku bizibu ebibaddewo mu mawanga gaffe, gamba ng'ekitta bantu ekyaliwo mu Rwanda.
When you see masses of Rwandans, given Rwanda‘s ethnic configurations and the politics that existed in this country for so many years, do you think those crowds that turn up, the cheering they give is all genuine?	Bw'olaba abantu b'omu Rwanda nga bakungaanye mu bungi, era n'olowooza ku byafaayo by'amawanga gaabwe n'embeera y'eby'obufuzi eyaliwo mu ggwanga okumala emyaka mingi, olowooza abo bonna abakungaana era ne bakuba emizira baba beesiimbu?
Are you saying that this country, in the 2010, has traversed a long journey away from its politics where one’s ethnicity determined their position in politics, that they would turn up and they cheer a certain candidate called Kagame,a Tutsi, who doesn’t share a common ethnicity with the majority Hutu and be very happy about him?	Ky'ogamba eggwanga lino, mu 2010, lizzeemu enkyukakyuka ne kiba nti kati ekifo omuntu ky'alina mu by'obufuzi tekisinziira ku ggwanga lye, era nti abantu basobola okujja mu bungi ne bawagira omusajja eyeesimbyewo ayitibwa Kagame, Omutuusi, atali wa ggwanga ly'abantu abasinga obungi, Abahutu, abantu ne baba nga ddala bamusanyukira nnyo?
But leadership that is determined to change that course will also succeed with the same people, and that is what we are experiencing under a different leadership that values the people of this country irrespective of their background, and rallying them for a common cause of building a new nation of Rwanda.	Naye obukulembeze obumaliridde okukyusa endowooza eyo era busobola okutuuka ku buwanguzi n'abantu abo be bamu, era ekyo kyennyini kye kyabaawo obukulembeze obulala we bwajja ate nga bwo butwala abantu bonna nga ba muwendo ka babe ba ggwanga ki, era ne bubakuumaakuma okuba n'ekiruubirirwa kye kimu eky'okuzimba eggwanga eriggya erya Rwanda.
This is what Rwandans deserve and not a Rwanda of the Hutu, Tutsi or Twa.	Kino Abanyarwanda kye beetaaga, so si Rwanda ey'Abahutu, Abatuusi, oba Abatwa.
People will say that President Kagame has a very sophisticated intelligence system and this system has spread its tentacles up to the last village, he has intimidated everybody.	Abantu abamu bayinza okugamba nti Pulezidenti Kagame alina ekitongole ekikessi kya maanyi ekituuka ne mu bwalo obusembayo eyo,  aleetedde abantu bonna okutya.
Ordinary Rwandan peasants were harassed.	Abanyarwanda aba bulijjo baatulugunyizibwa.
People are just so afraid of this man called Kagame and they have to show up at his rallies and to vote.	Abantu batya nnyo omusajja ono ayitibwa Kagame era baba tebalina kya kukola okuggyako okujja ne babaawo ku nkungaana z'akuba era ne bamuwa akalulu.
Millions of Rwandans, over 5 million Rwandans could be taken, intimidated, confused and manipulated and nobody complains.	 Abantu bukadde na bukadde mu Rwanda, abantu abasukka mu bukadde 5 mu Rwanda basobola okukwatibwa, okutiisibwatiisibwa, ne babuzaabuzibwa, oba ne babagulirira ne watabaawo yenna yeemulugunya.
You have reduced the incidence of malaria by almost eighty five percent, you have gotten ninety percent of Rwandans on medical insurance, you have done the roads and you have fought corruption.	Okendeezezza omuwendo gw'abantu abakwatibwa omusujja kumpi ebitundu 85 ku buli kikumi , Abanyarwanda 90 ku buli kikumi obatadde ku yinsuwa y'obujjanjabi, okoze enguudo, era olwanyisizza obulyi bw'enguzi.
Kagame speaks about his election victory.	Kagame ayogera ku buwanguzi bwe yali atuuseeko mu kalulu.

The Electoral Commission has said it will not issue voters cards because it’s too expensive.	Ekitongole ky'eby'okulonda kigambye nti tekijja kuwa bantu kaadi za kulonda kubanga zeetaagisa ssente nnyingi nnyo.

By election time in February 2006 the Electoral Commission had not printed the cards for the people who registered late.	Okulonda we kwabeererawo mu Febwali 2006 ekitongole ky'eby'okulonda kyali tekinnafulumya kaadi z'abo abeewandiisa ekikeerezi.
Rwakoojo said Electoral Commission only printed cards for the people who registered early.	Rwakoojo yagamba nti ekitongole ky'eby'okulonda kyakuba kaadi z'abo bokka abeewandiisa nga bukyali.
Rwakoojo said some cards were misplaced during the sorting and distributing process before they were sent to the districts.	Rwakoojo yagamba nti kaadi ezimu zaababulako bwe baali bazitegeka era nga bazibunyisa nga tezinnasindikibwa ku disitulikiti.

The Congress of South African Trade Unions was one of the key players in the Zuma for president campaign.	Ekibiina kya Congress of South African Trade Unions kye kimu ku byasemba Zuma okuba pulezidenti.

The delegates held their breath at the fire spitting National Resistance Movement.	Abaaliwo baasiriikirira nga bawulira ekibiina kya NRM kiwanda omuliro.
He made a bitter attack on his incumbent Amama Mbabazi.	Yakolokota nnyo munne Amama Mbabazi.
“Mr Chairman, before I begin campaigning I have two complaints,” Otafiire started.	Otafiire yatandika n'ebigambo bino “Sssebo ssentebe w'olukungaana, nga sinnagenda mu maaso nnina okwemulugunya kwa mirundi ebiri.”
Otafiire left the campaign podium for the President where Mbabazi was seated.	Otafiire yava ku katuuti Pulezidenti addeko okwogera era Mbabazi yali atudde awo.
Journalists rushed to capture that dramatic photograph of an angry Otafiire making his case before the President.	Bannamawulire baayanguwa okukuba ebifaananyi bya Otafiire eyali omusunguwavu ng'alina ensonga gy'ategeeza Pulezidenti.
Otafiire is the minister of trade, tourism and industry.	Otafiire ye minisita w'eby'obusuubuzi n'amakolero.
After three minutes of dead silence, President Museveni rescued himself out of the crossroads.	Oluvannyuma lw'eddakiika ssatu ez'akasiriikiriro ak'amaanyi, Pulezidenti Museveni yeenunula mu kattu ke baali bamutaddemu.
We assure Honourable Otafiire that his concerns are being taken care of.	Twakakasa ow'ekitiibwa Otafiire nti ensonga ze zikolwako.
The voters’ register will be displayed at the polling stations,” said Felistus Magomu, the National Resistance Movement electoral commission chairperson.	" Felistus Magomu, ssentebe w'eby'okulonda mu kibiina kya NRM yagamba nti, ""Olukalala lw'abalonzi lujja kutimbibwa mu bifo ebironderwamu.”"
Defiant Otafiire openly attacked Mbabazi over distributing different and less amounts of money as allowances to the delegates.	Otafiire eyali tasalikako musale yalangirira Mbabazi mu lujjudde nti ssente ze yawa abantu zaali tezimala.
Mbabazi said one of the candidates was telling delegates that they complained of receiving lesser money than they were entitled.	Mbabazi yagambye nti omu ku beesimbyewo yagamba abantu beemulugunye nti baali tebabawadde ssente zimala.
I am that candidate and I will say it again,” Otafiire charged.	" Otafiire yakyogera lunye nti, ""Nze nnagambye abantu okwemulugunya, era nja kuddamu nkyogere.”"
Mbabazi, who campaigned first, said one of his competitors was spreading malicious rumours about him on distribution of money to delegates.	Mbabazi, eyasooka ne yeemulugunya, yagamba nti omu ku baavuganya nabo abunyisa ebigambo ebigendereddwa okwonoona erinnya lye ku kuwa abantu ssente.
Other contenders for the Secretary General Gilbert Bukenya, Elijah Mushemeza, Theodore Ssekikubo and Kibibi, had made their two minute campaign speeches.	N'abalala abaali beesimbyewo ku kifo kya Secretary General, Gilbert Bukenya, Elijah Mushemeza, Theodore Ssekikubo, ne Kibibi, baali bamaze okwogera nga bakuba kampeyini yaabwe ey'eddakiika ebbiri.
Mbabazi fired back.	Mbabazi yamwanukula.
He counter accused Otafiire of making false accusations without consulting the relevant people for facts.	Yanenya Otafiire olw'okumwogerako ebintu ebikyamu nga tasoose kwebuuza kufuna bukakafu.
Delegates from far away areas like Karamoja, Rwenzori, West Nile, Acholi, Lango and Kigezi were given three hundred thousand shillings as accommodation.	Abantu abaava mu bitundu by'ewala gamba ng'e Karamoja, Rwenzori, West Nile, Acholi, Lango, ne Kigezi baaweebwa emitwalo asatu zibayambe mu by'ensula.
Mbabazi did not comment on the different accreditation cards and denying genuine delegates into the conference as Otafiire, Bukenya and Ssekikubo alleged.	Mbabazi teyayogera ku bya kaadi ndala na bya kugaana bantu abatuufu kubaawo mu lukungaana olwo nga Otafiire, Bukenya, ne Ssekikubo bwe baali balumiriza.
Museveni did not call back Otafiire to respond to Mbabazi’s answers.	Museveni teyayita Otafiire kwanukula Mbabazi.
Mbabazi appeared to have outdone his opponents.	Mbabazi yalabika ng'eyali awangudde abaali bamulumiriza.
Otafiire kept telling delegates that this is the time to redeem our party but they seemed to have already made their choice.	Otafiire yasigala agamba abaaliwo nti kino kye kiseera okununula ekibiina kyaffe naye kirabika baamaze dda okusalawo gwe baagala.
Mbabazi’s camp too was making similar rounds to groups of delegates selling their candidate.	N'aba Mbabazi nabo baali bayita mu bantu nga bamukuutira akadingidi.
It was Bukenya’s camp that was making rather quiet campaigns.	Naye bo aba Bukenya baali basirise busirisi.
Mbabazi’s “super” authority in the National Resistance Movement cannot be underrated.	Obuyinza Mbabazi bw'alina mu kibiina kya NRM bungi.
Even after the electoral commissioner’s reminders that campaigns had closed, Mbabazi continued campaigning for votes thirty minutes into the voting time.	Akulira okulonda ne bwe yajjukiza abantu nti ekiseera ky'okunoonya akalulu kyali kiweddeko, Mbabazi yeeyongerayo eddakiika asatu ng'anoonya akalulu.
It took the intervention of the president to announce that campaigns had closed for Mbabazi to stop.	Pulezidenti yamala kukyogera nti okunoonya akalulu kuwedde olwo Mbabazi n'alyoka alekera awo.
When the results were announced, Mbabazi had carried the day with five thousand six hundred ninety four votes.	Ebyali bivudde mu kulonda bwe byalangirirwa, Mbabazi ye yali awangudde n'obululu 5,694.
Other new faces were in the posts of national vice chairpersons for Karamoja, Northern Uganda, Central Uganda and Kampala.	Abantu abapya baali bazze mu bifo by'abamyuka ba ssentebe mu ggwanga mu bitundu bya Karamoja, mu Bukiikakkono bwa Uganda, mu Massekkati ga Uganda, ne mu Kampala.
Museveni was chosen party national chairman and National Resistance Movement presidential candidate unopposed and so was Moses Kigongo for national vice chairman.	Museveni yalondebwa awatali amuvuganya okuba ssentebe wa NRM mu ggwanga era okuba oyo anaakwata bbendera yaabwe mu kalulu kw'oba pulezidenti era ne Moses Kigongo teyavuganyizibwa ku kifo ky'omumyuka wa ssentebe w'ekibiina mu ggwanga.
Rebecca Kadaga was chosen national deputy vice chairperson and Michael Mukula for Eastern region.	Rebecca Kadaga yalondebwa okuba omumyuka w'omumyuka wa ssentebe w'ekibiina mu ggwanga era Michael Mukula yalondebwa mu kitundu ky'Ebuvanjuba bw'eggwanga.
Matayo Kyaligonza defeated Chris Baryomunsi for vice chairman for Western Uganda.	Matayo Kyaligonza yawangula Chris Baryomunsi ku kifo ky'omumyuka wa ssentebe mu Bugwanjuba bwa Uganda.
Why is Mbabazi still President Museveni’s blue eyed boy?	Lwaki Pulezidenti Museveni akyayagala nnyo Mbabazi?
The delegates knew very well from the days of the Temangalo controversy when the President defended Mbabazi’s role in the land deal.	Abaliwo baali bamanyi bulungi engeri Pulezidenti gye yawolerezaamu Mbabazi mu nsonga z'ettaka ly'e Temangalo.
The fact that Museveni did not fault Mbabazi on any of the accusations, it spoke volumes about how close the two are.	Okuba nti Museveni teyalaga nti Mbabazi yalina ensobi yonna kyalaga bulungi nti abantu abo ababiri enkolagana yaabwe ya ku lusegere nnyo.
Nearly every candidate who stood up to campaign had to repeatedly cite Museveni’s name to boost their campaign.	Kumpi buli omu eyavaayo okukuba kampeyini yalina okwogera ku linnya lya Museveni okusobola okufuna obuganzi.
You could clearly see how candidates were fighting to endear themselves to Museveni.	Wali okiraba nti buli omu ku baali beesimbyewo yali agezaako okufuna  obuganzi okuva eri Museveni.
Being the party’s Secretary General, Mbabazi was the lead organiser of the elections in which he was a candidate.	Okuva bwe kiri nti ye Muwandiisi omukulu ow'ekibiina, Mbabazi ye yawoma omutwe mu kutegeka okulonda naye kennyini mwe yali omu ku beesimbyewo.
On voting day Mbabazi and his opponents only had two minutes to market their manifestos and candidature.	Ku lunaku lw'okulonda, Mbabazi ne be yali avuganya nabo baaweebwa eddakiika bbiri zokka okumatiza abantu nti balina obusobozi.
Apart from the advantages of incumbency, Mbabazi is a clever strategist.	Ng'oggyeeko okuba nti yali wa nkizo okusinga banne, Mbabazi era mugezi.
He allied with most delegates and candidates from the North, East, Karamoja and central regions.	Yakola omukago n'abakiise abasinga obungi awamu n'abo abaali beesimbyewo ku bifo by'omu Bukiikakkono, Ebuvanjuba, Karamoja, ne mu massekkati g'eggwanga.
Each of the candidates from these region campaigned for themselves as they did for Mbabazi.	Buli omu ku bantu abo yali yeenoonyeza akalulu ng'ate mu kiseera kye kimu akanoonyeza ne Mbabazi.
His only strong opposition came from the western region.	Okuvuganya okw'amaanyi yakufuna mu bitundu bya bugwanjuba mwokka.
Indeed Mbabazi won in all the north, West Nile, east, Karamoja and central regions despite persistent accusa-tions of voter bribery.	Mu butuufu Mbabazi yawangula mu bitundu byonna eby'omu bukiikakkono, West Nile, buvanjuba, Karamoja, ne mu massekkati g'eggwanga wadde nga baamulumiriza okugulirira abalonzi.
Delegates who spoke to the independent alleged that Mbabazi’s camp was giving ten thousand shillings to every delegate who voted.	Abaaliwo baagamba olupapula lwa Independent nti aba Mbabazi baali bawa buli omu eyalonda omutwalo gumu.
A delegate who campaigned for Otafiire admitted to the Independent that he had been given twenty thousand shillings to vote Mbabazi.	Omu ku abo abaali banoonyeza Otafiire akalulu yagamba nti yaweebwa emitwalo ebiri alonde Mbabazi.
Overall it underlined the indispensability of bribery in National Resistance Movement elections.	Okutwalira awamu ekyo kyalaga enguzi eri mu NRM.
Mbabazi’s camp had also pulled off a tactical media manipulation the previous day, which worked in his favour.	Era eggulo limu enkambi ya Mbabazi yali ekozesezza akakodyo okuyitira ku mikutu gy'empuliziganya era kaamukolera.
A government newspaper reported that the party’s National Executive Committee had asked Bukenya and Otafiire to step down for Mbabazi.	Olupapula lwa gavumenti lwagamba nti akakiiko k'ekibiina kya NRM kaali kalagidde Bukenya ne Otafiire okulekera Mbabazi ekifo ekyo.
This created doubt among some delegates who had intended to vote Bukenya and Otafiire	Ekyo kyaleetawo okubuusabuusa mu bantu abamu abaali baagala okulonda Bukenya ne Otafiire
On the first day of the conference Bukenya spent the most of the day doing damage control and denouncing the media reports.	Ekitundu ekisinga eky'olunaku olwasooka olw'olukungaana, Bukenya yakimala agezaako okumatiza abantu nti ebyayogeddwa emikutu gy'eby'empuliziganya tebyabadde bituufu.
Bukenya’s troubles were not over yet.	Ebizibu bya Bukenya byali tebinnaggwa.
Knowing that other media would have carried Bukenya’s rebuttal, the government newspaper moved faster.	Olw'okuba baali bakimanyi nti emikutu gy'empuliziganya emirala gyali gisobola okuwandiika ku kulambika kwa Bukenya, olupapula lw'amawulire olwa gavumenti lwabaako kye lukolawo mu bwangu.
It was followed up with another story that Bukenya and Otafiire had defied the party’s central executive committee directive.	Lwaddako ne lugamba nti Bukenya ne Otafiire bajeemedde ekiragiro ky'abakulira ekibiina kyabwe.
Bukenya had no more chance to rebut this.	Bukenya yali takyalina kakisa kalala kulambika ku nsonga eyo.
Museveni addressed the party delegates at thirty minutes past two on Sunday night.	Ku ssaawa munaana ez'ekiro ku Ssande, Museveni yayogera eri ab'ekibiina abaali bazze mu lukungaana.
"""If we had wanted to vet Bukenya or Otafiire out, they would not have come here,” Museveni said."	"Museveni yagamba nti, ""Singa twabadde twagala okuggya Bukenya oba Otafiire mu lwokaano, bandibadde tebajja wano.”"
I put my thoughts to Central Executive Committe,” he added in response to reports that Otafire and Bukenya had defied his orders.	"Ng'ayanukula ebyali bigambibwa nti Otafire ne Bukenya baali basambazze ekiragiro kye yagamba  nti, ""Ebirowoozo byange nnabitegeezezza Central Executive Committee.”"
Only thirteen positions in National Resistance Movement were vetted.	Ebifo kkumi na bisatu byokka mu NRM bye byesimbiddwamu.
P.hone text messages were sent to delegates claiming National Resistance Movement opinion polls had put Mbabazi in the lead.	Obubaka bwaweerezebwa ku masimu nga bulaga nti okunoonyereza mu NRM kulaga nti Mbabazi y'akulembedde banne.
At seven in the evening, another text message was sent to the delegates that provisional results now showed Mbabazi in the lead.	Ku ssaawa emu ey'akawungeezi, obubaka obulala ku masimu bwasindikibwa eri abakiise ne bubategeeza kati Mbabazi ye yali akulembedde.
This might have swayed voters in Mbabazi’s favor but what cannot be ascertained is how many were influenced by the text messages.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga kyaleetera abalonzi okwongera okwettanira Mbabazi naye kizibu okumanya bameka abaasendebwasendebwa obubaka obwo obw'oku ssimu.
Many things worked in Mbabazi’s favour.	Ebintu bingi Mbabazi byali bimutambulira bulungi.
Major General Kahinda Otafiire raised to the podium to campaign for the position of party Secretary General.	Meja Genero Kahinda Otafiire yagenda ku katuuti okukuba kampeyini ku kifo kya Secretary General w'ekibiina.
Amama Mbabazi was accused of printing different accreditation cards for the delegates with the purpose of rigging the elections.	Amama Mbabazi baamulumiriza nti yali akubye kaadi z'abalonzi endala ng'alina ekigendererwa eky'okubba akalulu.
Election chaos leaves National Resistance Movement in mess.	Obuvuyo obwaliwo mu kulonda bwatabula nnyo ab'ekibiina kya NRM.
Museveni’s former principal private secretary Amelia Kyambadde won unopposed after the incumbent Ndaula Kaweesi pulled out at the last minute.	Amelia Kyambadde, eyaliko omuwandiisi omukulu owa Museveni yawangula nga tavuganyiziddwa oluvannyuma lw'eyali mu kifo ekyo Ndaula Kaweesi okuva mu lwokaano.
The senior National Resistance Movement officials were making accusations against Mbabazi at the conference.	Abakungu ab'oku ntikko mu NRM baali balina bye balumiriza Mbabazi mu lukiiko olwo.
This did not only affect their supporters’ morale but also created doubt about Bukenya and Otafiire’s loyalty to the party.	Ng'oggyeeko okumalamu abalonzi baabwe amaanyi, ekyo kyaleetera abakiise okubuusabuusa obanga Bukenya ne Otafiire baali beesigwa eri ekibiina.
Museveni dismissed the media reports that Bukenya and Otafiire had defied the Central Executive Committee directive to stand down.	Museveni yagamba nti ebyafulumira ku mikutu gy'empuliziganya nti Bukenya ne Otafiire baali bajeemedde ekiragiro kye si bituufu.
Mbabazi had seventy two percent followed by Bukenya with fifteen percent and Otafiire thirteen percent.	Mbabazi yafuna obululu 72 ku buli kikumi, n'addirirwa Bukenya n'obululu 15 ku buli kikumi, Otafiire n'addako n'obululu 13 ku buli kikumi.
In fact there was complaining among the candidates that Mbabazi’s family had taken over the election process.	Mu butuufu waaliwo okwemulugunya mu bakiise nti ab'omu maka ga Mbabazi baali beefuze eby'okulonda.
Why cannott we decentralise? Bukenya asked.	Bukenya yabuuza nti, Lwaki obuyinza tetubuwako ku balala?
He was suggesting to Mbabazi’s family.	Ekibuuzo ekyo yali akyolekeza eri ab'omu maka ga Mbabazi.
His daughter, Nina Mbabazi, was in charge of the party Information Technology system which stored information on every delegate.	Muwala wa Mbabazi, Nina Mbabazi, ye yali avunaanyizibwa ku byuma bya tekinologiya w'ekibiina omwali muteekeddwa ebikwata ku buli omu ku bakiise.
His wife, Jacquiline Mbabazi, was elected chairperson of the National Resistance Movement Women’s League.	Mukyala we, Jacquiline Mbabazi, yalondebwa okuba ssentebe wa NRM ow'ekiwayi ky'abakazi.
Her rival Nusura Tiperu accused her of bribing the voters.	Nusura Tiperu eyali amuvuganya yamulumiriza okugulilira abalonzi.
Mbabazi’s wife was also handling the issue of refunding the delegates’ transport fare and allowances.	Mukyala wa Mbabazi era ye yali akola ku kuddiza abakiise ssente ze baasaasaanya ku ntambula.
The hotels and restaurants that served food to the delegates were procured by the Mbabazi’ camp.	Wooteeri ezaagabula emmere abakiise mu lukungaana olwo ab'oku ludda lwa Mbabazi be baazifuna.
Even the ushers were campaigning for Mbabazi.	N'abaali baweereza emmere baali bakubira Mbabazi kampeyini.
They veiled their heads with scarfs with inscriptions to vote Mbabazi.	Obukofiira bwe baayambala bwaliko ebigambo ebikubiriza abakiise okulonda Mbabazi.
Mbabazi had all the machinery under his control.	Buli kimu Mbabazi kyamuli mu ttaano.
All the buses transporting the delegates were campaigning for him, how would you expect him to lose? said a delegate from Mityana.	Omu ku bakiise eyava e Mityana yagamba nti, Bbaasi zonna ezaali zitambuza abakiise mu lukiiko olwo zaali zinoonyeza Mbabazi akalulu. Akalulu yali tayinza butakawangula!
In the June conference, the National Resistance Movement came under strong criticism by its members after logistics for the delegates were mishandled. 	Mu lukungaana olwaliwo mu Jjuuni, aba NRM baavumirirwa nnyo ekibiina kyabwe ekyo olw'obutakola bulungi ku byetaago by'abakiise.
The same mess was repeated during the September sixth -ninth Special Organs Conference.	Ekizibu kye kimu kye kyaliwo ne mu lukungaana olw'ebiwayi eby'enjawulo olwaliwo okuva nga 6-9 Ssebutemba.
Hundreds of delegates queued up the whole day to get empowered.	Abakiise bangi baasimba ennyiriri okumala olunaku lwonna okuweebwa ebyetaagisibwa.
Museveni’s reserved post Unlike in other political parties where the race for the party presidency was tight, Museveni’s was like God-reserved post.	Obutafaananako bibiina birala omwali okuvuganya okw'amaanyi ku kifo ky'anaakwata bbendera mu kulonda kw'obwa pulezidenti ye Museveni teyafuna kuvuganya kwonna mu kibiina kye, ng'ekifo ekyo kiringa ekyamutegekerwa Katonda.
Nobody stood against him.	Tewali yamwesimbako.
Even those who had expressed interest in the post were vet-ted out by the party’s National Eelection Confrence.	N'abamu ku abo abaakiraga nti baali baagala okuvuganya naye ku kifo ekyo, baagaanibwa olukiiko lw'ekibiina olukola ku by'okulonda.
Salim Saleh, Museveni’s brother and he is a junior officer in the army.	Salim Saleh, muganda wa Museveni era wa wansiko mu ranka mu magye.
This is not a person who would put Museveni on competition.	Ono si ye muntu asobola okuvuganya Museveni.
In March this year Forum for Democratic Change nominated the incumbent Doctor Kizza Besigye.	Mu Maaki w'omwaka guno, ab'ekibiina kya FDC baalonda Doctor Kizza Besigye okubakwatira bbendera yaabwe.
They carried out three-month rigorous campaigns countrywide.	Baamala emyezi esatu nga bamukubira kampeyini okwetooloola eggwanga.
That competition was totally lacking in the National Resistance Movement elections for the presidency at Nambole.	Okuvuganya ng'okwo tekwaliwo mu NRM e Namboole mu kulonda anaabakwatira bbendera mu kuvuganya ku ntebe y'obwa pulezidenti.
This has played in the attacker hands who say the National Resistance Movement is a one-man’s party.	Abo abavumirira NRM bagamba nti ekibiina ekyo kya muntu omu.
Analysts say that the fact Museveni still does not allow anyone internally to compete against him for the party presidency.	Abeekenneenya ensonga bagamba nti ekituufu kiri nti Museveni takkiriza muntu yenna mu kibiina kye kumuvuganya ku bwa pulezidenti bwa kibiina kya NRM.
They say such elections would allow Museveni and the National Resistance Movement identify an emerging successor if he was interested in one anyway.	Bagamba nti okulonda ng'okwo kuyamba Museveni ne NRM okumanya abo abasobola okumuddira mu bigere singa aba akyagadde.
Museveni explains election mess Museveni dismissed claims that the violence in the primaries spelt the party.	Museveni yasambajja ebigambibwa nti obuvuyo obwaliwo mu kulonda bwe bulaga ki ekibiina kye kye kiri .
He explained that opportunists within the National Resistance Movement who were charged with registering party members in the Yellow book.	Yagamba nti bannakigwanyizi mu kibiina kya NRM baaweebwa obuvunaanyizibwa obw'okuwandiika abantu b'ekibiina mu kitabo kya kyenvu.
This forced the National Resistance Movement to use the national Electral Commission voters’ register because of the greed of the unscrupulous party members.	Olw'omululu gw'abantu abamu mu kibiina, NRM yawalirizibwa okusalawo okukozesa olukalala lw'abalonzi olw'ekitongole ky'eby'okulonda mu ggwanga.
He said four billion shillings was released for the primaries for sixty thousand polling stations.	Yagamba nti obuwumbi buna bwe bwaweebwayo okukozesebwa mu kulonda okw'okusunsulamu mu bifo ebironderwamu kakaaga.
Otafiire left immediately when it became clear he had lost the vote.	Amangu ddala ng'akirabye nti bamuwangudde, Otafiire yavaawo n'agenda.
Vice President Bukenya too did not wait for announcement of the final results.	N'omumyuka wa pulezidenti, Bukenya, naye teyalinda kulangirira bya nkomeredde.
But analysts say the chaos in the primary elections has revealed that National Resistance Movement is a party controlled by power hungry individuals.	Abeekenneenya ensonga bagamba nti okulonda okw'okusunsulamu kwalaga nti NRM eri mu mikono gy'abantu abalulunkanira obuyinza.
That is why all complainants in the elections were petitioning Museveni instead of the established party structures to address their complaints.	Eyo ye nsonga lwaki okulonda bwe kwali kugenda mu maaso, okwemulugunya kwonna kwali kwolekezebwa eri Museveni mu kifo ky'okukwolekeza eri akakiiko k'ekibiina akassibwawo okukola ku kwemulugunya kwabwe.
But Museveni had his own interpretation.	Naye ekyo ye Museveni yakiraba bulala.
He said this showed Nationa Resistance Movement is a great party.	Yagamba nti ekyo kyalaga nti ekibiina kya NRM kya maanyi nnyo.
Otafiire’s camp was headed by Jim Muhwezi as the campaign manager and Brig. Henry Tumukunde as his chief election strategist.	Ab'oku ludda lwa Otafiire baali bakulemberwa Jim Muhwezi ng'akola nga kampeyini maneja ate nga Brig. Henry Tumukunde ng'akola ng'omuwi w'amagezi omukulu mu kulonda.
They could not launch an open attack on Mbabazi because the president had cautioned them to conduct campaigns free of personal attacks.	Baali tebasobola kulumba Mbabazi kubanga pulezidenti yali abalabudde baleme kulumbagana nga bakuba kampeyini.
It was only fearless Otafiire who came out boldly to campaign for himself.	Otafiire ye yekka eyayoleka obuvumu n'avaayo ne yeekubira kampeyini.
Tumukunde is believed to be a good mobilser.	Tumukunde agambibwa okuba omulungi mu kukumaakuma abantu.
He would not dare restart his reducng troubles with the state especially that he would confronting security minister and a close confidant of Museveni.	Yali tasobola kuddamu kuttusa bizibu bye yalina ne gavumenti ebyali bigenda bikkakkana ng'alumba minisita w'ensonga z'eby'okwerinda era mukwano gwa Museveni ow'oku lusegere.

After losing in the just concluded primaries for the ruling National Resistance Movement party flag-bearers’ race for the two thousand eleven general election.	Oluvannyuma lw'okuwangulwa mu kulonda okw'okusunsulamu okwa NRM okwakamalirizibwa okw'abo abanaakwata bbendera y'ekibiina mu kulonda kwa 2011.
Under the National Resistance Movement constitution.	Okusinziira ku ssemateeka w'ekibiina kya NRM.
When reminded that the National Resistance Movement party Chairman and presidential flag-bearer in the 2011 general elections, President Yoweri Museveni, has warned against such disloyalty to party. 	Bwe bajjukizibwa nti Pulezidenti Yoweri Museveni, Ssentebe w'ekibiina kya NRM era oyo akikwatidde bbendera mu kulonda kw'obwa pulezidenti okwa 2011, yabalabula okwewala obutaba beesigwa eri ekibiina.
At which the top party officials were elected amidst acrimony, Museveni got around and barked.	Olukungaana abakungu b'ekibiina mwe baalonderwa wakati mu kuvumagana n'okuyomba, Museveni yaboggola.
Whether most of the losers in the party primaries will either join the opposition or stay in the National Resistance Movement, but defy Museveni and contest as independents.	Tekimanyiddwa obanga abasinga obungi ku b'ekibiina abaawangulwa baneegatta ku ludda oluvuganya gavumenti oba banaasigala mu kibiina kya NRM naye ne bajeemera Museveni ne beesimbawo ku lwabwe.
As a group, the independents have pushed National Resistance Movement strategists into a tight corner.	Okutwalira awamu, abo abaagala okwesimbawo ng'abantu kinnoomu baleeseewo okusoomooza kwa maanyi eri abakulembera NRM.
“The independents are very hard to control,” says Daudi Migereko, the National Resistance Movement Chief Whip.	Daudi Migereko, Chief Whip wa NRM agamba nti, “Abo abeesimbawo ng'abantu kinnoomu baba bazibu okufuga.”
Migereko was referring to the doublebarreled punch that independents could give the National Resistance Movement during the 2011 elections and  thereafter in parliament.	Migereko yali ayogera ku kusoomooza abeesimbawo kinnoomu kwe bajja okuwa NRM mu kulonda kwa 2011 n'oluvannyuma mu paliyamenti.
The issue of disgruntled National Resistance Movement members who run as independents was high on the agenda when the National Resistance Movement National Executive Committee met in January.	Ensonga eyo ekwata ku ba NRM abataali bamativu abaagala okwesimbawo ng'abantu kinoomu yasoosowazibwa mu lukungaana lw'abakulembeze ba NRM olwaliwo mu Jjanwali.
Going into the meeting at Entebbe State House on January 11;	Nga bagenda okufuna olukungaana mu maka g'obwa pulezidenti nga Jjanwali 11;
The National Resistance Movement Spokesperson, Ms Karooro Okurut, blamed independents on the Electoral College System, which was in use then.	Omwogezi wa NRM, Muky Karooro Okurut, yanenya abaali baagala okwesimbawo ng'abantu kinnnoomu mu nkola ya Electoral College, eyali ekozesebwa mu kiseera ekyo.
Subsequently the National Executive Committee meeting, hoping to end the postprimaries wrangling, adopted the universal party member vote.	Bwe kityo, abaali mu lukungaana lw'abakulembeze ba NRM mu kugezaako okugonjoola okulumagana okwajjawo oluvannyuma lw'okulonda okw'okusunsulamu baasalawo okukozesa enkola ey'okulonda okw'awamu okwa bammemba b'ekibiina.
The just concluded National Resistance Movement primaries are likely to produce the highest number of independents ever during an election and even in parliament.	Okulonda kwa NRM okw'okusunsulamu okwakakomekkerezebwa kuyinza okuvaako omuwendo ogukyasinzeeyo obunene mu byafaayo by'okulonda ogw'abantu abaagala okwesimbawo kinnoomu.
Apart of the problem is exactly what Karooro Okurut predicted, the cost of the election.	Karooro Okurut yali yakiraga nti obumu ku buzibu bwe bandifunye bwandibadde bwa ssente ennyingi ezisaasaanyizibwa mu kulonda.
Karooro Okurut was right when she said using adult votes at the primaries was like running “two sets of elections”.	"Karooro Okurut yali mutuufu kubanga engeri gye baali balondamu ""baali ng'abategeka okulonda kwa mirundi ebiri ”."
For this reason, some National Resisance Movement members who feared being routed at the primaries opted to run as independents.	Eyo ye nsonga eyaleetera abamu ku ba NRM okutya okuwangulwa mu kulonda okw'okusunsulamu ne basalawo okwesimbawo kinnoomu.
Peter Claver Mutuluza is typical.	Peter Claver Mutuluza y'omu ku bantu ng'abo.
He is the incumbent Member of Parliament for Mawokota South but he was left in a lock when Amelia Kyambadde, the powerful former Principle Private Secretary to President Yoweri Museveni, threw her hat in the ring.	Ye mubaka wa paliyamenti owa Mawokota South naye yafunamu okutya Amelia Kyambadde, omukazi ow'amaanyi eyaliko omuwandiisi wa pulezidenti bwe yeesowolayo okuvuganya naye ku kifo ekyo.
Amelia is a favourite because of her closeness to the President and Mutuluza had no chance against her in the primaries.	Amelia alina omukisa munene okuwangula olw'okuba mukwano gwa Pulezidenti wa ku lusegere nnyo era Mutuluza yakiraba nga tasobola kumuwangula.
He says he will run as an independent Lt. Hannington Basakana and John Banalya who are going to contest against Government Chief Whip Daudi Migereko in Butembe County were in a similar situation.	Agamba nti agenda kwesimbawo ng'omuntu kinnoomu, Lt. Hannington Basakana ne John Banalya abagenda okuvuganya Daudi Migereko e Butembe nabo bali mu mbeera efaananako bw'etyo.

The most dramatic announcements were however those made by Vincent Sempijja who lost Kalungu East to Lule Mawiya, and Samuel Abura Pirir who lost Matheniko to John Baptist Lokwii.	Naye ebyasinga okwewuunyisa bye bigambo bya Vincent Sempijja eyawangulwa Lule Mawiyae e Kalungu East, ne Samuel Abura Pirir eyawangulwa John Baptist Lokwii e Matheniko.
Ssempijja said that being independent will help him fight “massive election rigging deeply embedded in the NRM,” while Abura Pirir announced that he had quit the National Resistance Movement.	Ssempijja yagamba nti okwesimbawo ng'omuntu kinnoomu kijja kumuyamba okulwanyisa “ekibba bululu eky'amaanyi ekiri mu NRM,” ate ye Abura Pirir yalangirira nti yali avudde mu NRM.
Rigged elections sources within the National Resistance Movement and Electoral Commission indicate that all the one thousand and five hundred petitions cite ballot stuffing which resulted in figures that are either way above the numbers in the national register or in conflict with the total number of votes cast at district Chairman and Woman Member of Parliament’s level.	Ensonda ku kibba bululu mu NRM ne mu kitongole ky'eby'okulonda ziraga nti abantu bonna 1,500 abaajulira bagamba nti obusanduuko bw'okulonda bwakwatibwamu ne kiviirako obululu okusukka ennyo oba okuba obutono ennyo ku obwo obwakubwa mu kulonda ssentebe wa disituliki n'omubaka wa paliyamenti ow'abakyala.
In Kalungu East, Vincent Sempijja has raised a red flag over disparities in the number of votes on the National Resistance Movement register and those on the national voter register.	E Kalungu East, Vincent Sempijja yeemulugunya ku butakwatagana wakati w'obululu ku nkalala za NRM n'obw'abalonzi abali ku nkalala z'eggwanga.
He argues that while the total number of registered voters on the national voter register is about thirty two thousand those on the National Resistance Movement register were said to be thirty thousand eight hundred fifty three.	Agamba nti wadde ng'enkalala z'abalonzi ez'eggwanga ziraga nti abalonzi abaawandiisibwa bali nga 32,000, abo abali ku nkalala za NRM bagambibwa okuba nga bali 30,853.
He wonders whether even members of the opposition participated in what was meant to be an apparently National Resistance Movement affair.	Yeebuuza obanga n'ab'oludda oluvuganya gavumenti beenyigira mu kulonda kwa NRM.
In Rwemiyaga County, Patrick Nkalubo’s fifteen thousand and four hundred sixty six votes and Theodore Ssekikubo’s fifteen thousand and four hundred twenty three votes show that National Resistance Movement voters there were thirty one thousand four hundred eighty.	Mu Rwemiyaga, obululu 15,466 Patrick Nkalubo bwe yafuna n'obululu 15,423 Ssekikubo bwe yafuna bulaga nti abalonzi ba NRM mu kitundu ekyo baali 31,480.
Foreign Affairs Minister Sam Kuteesa’s thirty nine thousand and eight hundred eighty four votes added to the fourteen thousand and six hundred ninety three votes that his two opponents, Isha Ntumwa and Vincent Kimbugwe, got gives Mawogola county forty four thousand and five hundred seventy seven votes.	Obululu 39,884 minisita ow'ensonga z'ebweru Sam Kuteesa bwe yafuna bw'obugatta ku bululu 14,693 banne ababiri, Isha Ntumwa ne Vincent Kimbugwe, abaali bamuvuganya bwe baafuna,  bulaga nti e Mawogola abantu 44,577 be baalonda.
Sources within the National Resistance Movement are also afraid that where the number of independents surges, the group might form another political party or join the opposition and take charge of parliament.	Ensonda mu NRM ziraga nti omuwendo gw'ab'ekibiina ekyo abaagala okwesimbawo kinnoomu gweyongedde nnyo ekireeseewo obweraliikirivu nti bayinza okusalawo okukola ekibiina ky'eby'obufuzi ekirala oba okwegatta ku bawakanya gavumenti ne beefuga paliyamenti.
The National Resistance Movement thrives on control of the legislature and has invested heavily in controlling its Member of Parliaments' in parliament.	Ekibiina kya NRM amaanyi gaakyo agasinga obungi gali mu kwefuga ekitongole ekiteesi ky'amateeka era kissa ssente nnyingi mu kukakasa nti kiba n'omuwendo gw'abakiise abasinga obungi mu paliyamenti.
Under the relatively new multiparty dispensation, the National Resistance Movement which has a big majority in parliament has often opted to do most of its business in the National Resistance Movement parliamentary assembly and merely present them in parliament to be rubberstamped.	Mu nkola empya ey'ebibiina by'obufuzi, ekibiina kya NRM ekisinga okuba n'omuwendo gw'abakiise mu paliyamenti kyasalawo ebintu ebisinga obungi okubisalirawo mu lukiiko lw'ababaka ba paliyamenti aba NRM oluvannyuma ne babyanjulira paliyamenti okubisemba.
However, it has had no policy of dealing with dispute, especially from independents.	Nye tekibadde na nkola ya kukwatamu kwemulugunya, naddala okwo okuva mu abo abeesimbawo kinnoomu.
A raft of penalties and sanctions, including verbal and written reprimands from the chief whip, suspension of a member from the assembly, removal from leadership positions, and reference of a case to the part disciplinary bodies have been drafted to reign in dissenting National Resistance Movement Members of Parliament.	Waliwo ebibonerezo ebitali bimu ebibagiddwa okukangavvula bamemba ba NRM ab'omu paliyamenti, omuli okunenyezebwa mu bigambo oba mu buwandiike oyo avunaanyizibwa ku mpisa , okugobwa mu luliiko, okuggibwako obuyinza, oba ensonga okugikwasa ebitongole by'ekibiina ebikwasisa empisa.
There are thirty eight independent Members of Parliament in the eighth parliament, one less than the number of the biggest opposition group, the Forum for Democratic Change.	Mu paliyamenti ey'omunaana mulimu bamemba ba paliyamenti 38 abeesimbawo kinnoomu, nga baabulako omu okuweza omuwendo gw'ab'ekibiina kya FDC, ekibiina ekivuganya gavumenti ekisingayo obunene.
Of the independent Members of Parliament, thirty two are disgruntled former National Resistance Movement members.	Ku abo abeesimbawo kinoomu kwaliko aba NRM 32 abataali bamativu na kulonda kwa mu kibiina kyabwe.
Some have signed Memorandums of Understanding with the National Resistance Movement party, but Chief Whip Migereko says that this does not bind them to supporting the party’s position all the time and that the party’s constitution cannot be invoked when dealing with them.	Abamu baatuuka ku kukkaanya n'ekibiina kya NRM, naye Chief Whip Migereko agamba nti ekyo tekibalemesa kuwakanya nsonga za kibiina mu paliyamenti era ssemateeka w'ekibiina aba takyabakolako.
The law on independents, rule four of the party’s constitution, which deals with prohibited conduct spells out dismissal from the party of any member for leader of the National Resistance Movement who either campaigns against the party’s official candidate or funds such a candidate’s opponents, enforcement of the law has until now been impossible.	Etteeka erikwata ku beesimbawo kinnoomu, etteeka ery'okuna mu ssemateeka w'ekibiina, erikwata ku nneeyisa etekkirizibwa lyogera ku kugobebwa okuva mu kibiina memba yenna oba omukulembeze wa NRM avuganya omuntu ekibiina gwe kisimbyewo mu butongole, oba awa ssente oyo amuvuganya, naye n'okutuusa leero kikyali kizibu okussa etteeka eryo mu nkola.
During the 2008 by elections to fill the vacant Bugembe Town Council chair, Migereko and Tororo Deputy Resident District Commissioner Richard Gulume supported independent candidate Sula Sentongo against the official candidate, Frank Kayemba who lost.	Mu kulonda okwa  2008 okujjuza ekifo kya Bugembe Town Council, Migereko ne Deputy Resident District Commissioner wa Tororo, Richard Gulume baawagira Sula Sentongo eyali yeesimbyewo yekka eyavuganya era n'awangula Frank Kayemba ekibiina gwe kyali kisimbyewo mu butongole.
Migereko and Gulume were never punished.	Migereko ne Gulume tebaabonerezebwa.
Though it is no explicit, Article 83 of the Uganda Constitution which deals with the tenure of office of Members of Parliament, says that a person ceases to be a legislator if that person quits the party for which he or she stood and was elected to parliament to join another party or remain in parliament as an independent member, or if having been elected as independent candidate, the person joins a political party.	Wadde nga tekirambikibwa bulungi, akawayiro 83 mu ssemateeka wa Uganda akakwata ku bifo by'obwa memba wa paliyamenti, kagamba nti omuntu alekera awo okuba ku ssiga eriteesi ly'amateeka singa ayabulira ekibiina kye baamulonderamu okujja mu paliyamenti ne yeegatta ku kibiina ekirala oba n'asigala mu paliyamenti ng'omuntu kinnoomu, oba singa yajja yekka naye oluvannyuma ne yeegatta ku kibiina ky'obufuzi ekimu.
With the law on their side, losers in the party primaries have an open ticket to contest the 2011 elections as independent candidates and emerge as a major block in parliament.	Olw'okuba etteeka eryo libakolera, abo abaawangulwa balina ebbeetu okuvuganya mu kalulu ka 2011 ng'abantu kinnoomu era ne bafuuka nsonga mu paliyamenti.
"""Is this the National Resistance Movement’s real fear?That is not something we are preoccupied with,” says Migereko."	"Migereko agamba nti, ""Kyandiba nti ekyo NRM ky'etya? Nedda ekyo tekitulumya mutwe.”"
Sources within the National Resistance Movement Electoral Commission indicate that all the one thousand and five hundred petitions cite ballotstuffing which resulted in figures that are either way above the numbers in the national register or in conflict with the total number of votes cast at district Chairman and Woman Member of Parliament’s level.	Ensonda mu NRM ziraga nti abantu bonna 1,500 abaajulira bagamba nti obusanduuko bw'okulonda bwakwatibwamu ne kiviirako obululu okusukka ennyo oba okuba obutono ennyo ku obwo obwakubwa mu kulonda ssentebe wa disituliki n'omubaka wa paliyamenti ow'abakyala.
On the morning of September 13, Vice President Gilbert Bukenya walked out of Namboole a lonely and dejected man.	Ku makya nga Ssebutemba 13, Omumyuka wa pulezidenti Gilbert Bukenya yava e Namboole nga munakuwavu nnyo.
The elections to the post of Secretary General of the National Resistance Movement had just left Bukenya with an egg on his face.	Okulonda kw'omuwandiisi wa NRM Bukenya tekwamugendera bulungi n'akamu.
So emphatic was Mbabazi’s victory that he got more than twice as much as the combined vote of all his opponents.	Obuwanguzi bwa Mbabazi bwali bwa maanyi era obululu bwe yafuna bwali bukubisaamu emirundi ebiri obw'abaali bamuvuganya.
On the other hand, Mbabazi had always been projected as aloof, unavailable and inaccessible to party members, which made him look unsuitable to hold the office of Secretary General.	Kyokka bangi baali bagamba nti Mbabazi yeewulira era tatuukirikika, ekyamuleetera okulabika ng'atasobola kuwangula kifo ekyo.
Following the chaotic National Resistance Movement primaries which most of the aggrieved candidates blamed on Mbabazi and the Secretariat, the elections had been expected to bring Mbabazi’s tenure as Secretary General tumbling down.	Oluvannyuma lw'obuvuyo obwali mu kulonda kwa NRM okw'okusunsulamu bangi bwe baateeka ku Mbabazi ne banne, kyali kirowoozebwa nti Mbabazi teyandisobodde kumalako kisanja kye.
Bukenya and Mbabazi’s conflict is not new.	Bukenya ne Mbabazi bazze bagugulana.
In 2007, Bukenya gave a recorded interview to daily Monitor in which he claimed there was a mafia in the government working to bring him down.	Mu 2007, Bukenya yawa ab'olupapula lwa Monitor akatambi mwe yagambira nti waaliwo mafiya mu gavumenti eyali ayagala okumusuula.
"But on the following day when the interview was published, Bukenya appeared at a press conference at State House to “clear the distortions""."	"Naye ku lunaku olwaddako ebyali ku katambi bwe byafulumira mu lupapula, Bukenya yayogera ne bannamawulire mu maka g'obwa pulezidenti “ng'aliko by'atangaaza ebikwata ku katambi ako."""
Sandwiched between Mbabazi and Sam Kutesa, he denied having said there was a mafia group plotting his downfall.	Ng'ayimiridde wakati wa Mbabazi ne Sam Kutesa, yeegaana okugamba nti waaliwo ekibinja kya bamafiya abaali bakola olukwe olw'okumusuula.
However it was widely interpreted that Mbabazi and Kutesa were the group Bukenya had referred but had now succumbed to their pressure.	Nye bangi baakitaputa nti Mbabazi ne Kutesa be bamafiya Bukenya be yali ayogerako naye n'agonda oluvannyuma lw'okumussaako akazito.
They are the same National Resistance Movement heavyweights that brought him down at the National Resistance Movement elections at Nambole last week.	Abo be basajja ba NRM ab'amaanyi be bamu abaamumegera mu kalulu ka NRM e Nambole wiiki ewedde.
So where does this election leave Bukenya and his relations with the President and Mbabazi in the party?	Kati akalulu ako akaakubwa kaakwata katya ku nkolagana ya Bukenya, Pulezidenti, ne Mbabazi mu kibiina kyabwe?
Forum for Democratic Change’s Vice Chairman in charge of Western Uganda, Patrick Baguma says Bukenya should better jump before he is pushed.	Patrick Baguma, ssentebe wa FDC mu bugwanjuba bwa Uganda yagamba nti Bukenya asaanidde okubuuka nga tebannamusindika.
Most of those who took positions had Museveni’s support.	Abasinga obungi ku abo abaawangula baalina obuwagizi bwa Museveni.
Bukenya’s defeat only shows that he is out of favour.	Okuba nti Bukenya yawangulwa kyalaga nti yali takyalina buganzi.
"""I don’t see him holding on as Vice President for long,” Baguma says."	"Baguma agamba nti, ""Siraba ngeri gy'asigala mu kifo ky'omumyuka wa pulezidenti.”"
Sources within the National Resistance Movement echo Baguma’s thinking.	Bangi mu NRM baali bakkiriziganya n'ebigambo bya Baguma ebyo.
They say Bukenya has put himself in a very vulnerable situation.	Bagamba nti Bukenya yeetadde mu buzibu.
He has given Museveni a blank cheque.	Anyiizizza nnyo Museveni.
"""There is no better opportunity for Museveni to sack him than now because his popularity at home in the party is now in question,” said a member of the National Resistance Movement’s Central Executive Committee who declined to be named."	"Omu ku b'oku lukiiko olukulembeze mu NRM ataayagala kwatuukirizibwa mannya yagamba nti, ""Tewali kakisa kasinga kano Museveni k'afunye kugoba Bukenya kubanga takyali muganzi mu kibiina.”"
"""That is a vote of no confidence,” he said referring to cases where Bukenya got no vote at some polling stations in the National Resistance Movement elections."	"Ng'ayogera ku ky'okuba nti mu bifo ebimu Bukenya teyafunawo kalulu, yagamba nti, ""Kyalaga nti baali bamuggyeemu obwesige.”"
The same source said that as early as March this year, Bukenya was advised not to ‘demote’ himself from the post of National Resistance Movement Vice Chairman for Central Region to contest for Secretary General.	Ensonda y'emu yagamba nti mu  Maaki w'omaka guno, Bukenya baamuwa amagezi aleme kuta kifo kye yalina ng'omumyuka wa ssentebe wa NRM mu bitundu by'omu massekkati olw'okwagala okuvuganya ku kifo ky'omuwandiisi w'ekibiina.
But not only did he defiantly go ahead to contest for the Secretary General post, he went for even a lower post of National Resistance Movement Chairman for Wakiso district.	Naye teyawuliriza n'agenda mu maaso okuvuganya ku ky'obuwandiisi bw'ekibiina ate era n'avuganya ne ku kifo ekya wansiko ekya ssentebe wa NRM mu disitulikiti ya Wakiso.
Why did Bukenya go for a post he had earlier ridiculed as inferior?	Lwaki Bukenya yasalawo okuvuganya ku kifo mu kusooka kye yali anyooma nti kya wansi?
Sources close to Bukenya say he had been aware that Museveni has been searching for someone to replace him as Vice President.	Abamu ku bali ku lusegere ne Bukenya bagamba nti yali akitegedde nti Museveni anoonya omuntu ow'okudda mu kifo kye eky'omumyuka wa pulezidenti.
The preferred choice is a Catholic from Northern Uganda as National Resistance Movement prepares for 2011 general elections.	Okusingira ddala yali ayagala Mukatuliki ava mu bukiikakkono bwa Uganda kubanga NRM yali yeetegekera okulonda kwa 2011.
The move is calculated to either split or win over the opposition vote in the region and compensate for the reversal the National Resistance Movement and Museveni are likely to suffer in Buganda.	Ekyo kyakolebwa okuleetawo enjawukana mu bavuganya gavumenti mu kitundu ekyo oba okuwangula emitima gyabwe okugezaako okuziba eddibu  ly'obululu NRM ne Museveni lye bayinza okufuna mu Buganda.
This according to the sources, knowing that the curtain is about to come down on him, Bukenya had to hold a powerful position of Secretary General to prove his political cloud within the party ranks and Buganda.	Okusinziira ku nsonda ezimu, Bukenya bwe yamanya nti anaatera okufiirwa ekifo kye ekyo, yayagala okufuna ekifo eky'amaanyi eky'omuwandiisi w'ekibiina alage nti yali akyali wa maanyi mu kibiina ne mu Buganda.
He has been repositioning himself in the central region.	Abadde agezaako okwenyweza mu bitundu by'omu massekkati g'eggwanga.
For example though he supported the closure of Central Broadcasting Services radio, he was the first top government official to hand in a cheque for the rehabilitation of the burnt Kasubi tombs of Buganda.	Ng'ekyokulabirako, wadde nga yawagira eky'okuggala leediyo ya CBS, ye mukungu wa gavumenti ow'amaanyi eyasooka okuwaayo ssente okuyamba mu kuddaabiriza amasiro ga Buganda ag'e Kasubi agaali gayidde.
The question now is whether the Namboole defeat did not leave him weaker and less politically relevant than before.	Kati ekyebuuzibwa kiri nti, Okulonda okwali e Namboole tekweyongera kumunafuya bunafuya kusinga ne bwe yali emabega?
Where does defeat leave Bukenya?	Okuwangulwa okwo kuleka wa Bukenya?
A supplementary display of lists of particulars recommended for correction ,deletion from the register or,inclusion on to the register will be conducted for a period of ten days within each parish from 3rd - 13th September 2010.

The biggest fear is that once the losers contest, the number of independent Member of Parliaments will significantly increase making independent Member of Parliaments another power block in the Parliament of Uganda.	Okweraliikirira okusinga kuli nti singa abo abaawangulwa basalawo okuvuganya, omuwendo gw'abeesimbyewo kinnoomu gujja kulinnya nnyo kifuule ekiwayi ky'abeesimbawo kinnoomu nakyo okuba eky'amaanyi mu paliyamenti ya Uganda.
With enough numbers to influence parliamentary business or even take the National Rsistance Movement hostage, the independent’s numbers may be crucial in swinging the vote.	Abeesimbawo kinnoomu bayinza okufuna amaanyi mangi nga basobola okwefuga paliyamenti n'okusiba NRM emikono n'okuba n'omukono gwa maanyi mu bisalibwawo paliyamenti.

“This is a very difficult situation for both Museveni and Bukenya, but I am sure they will all free themselves,” says Government Chief Whip Daudi Migereko.

Highly placed security sources in Uganda told the Independent that before he was shot, Lieutenant General Kayumba Nyamwasa approached Uganda’s military attachment to South Africa. 	Ensonda z'eby'okwerinda ezeesigika mu Uganda zaagamba olupapula lwa Independent nti bwe yali tannakubwa masasi, Lefutinanti Genero Kayumba Nyamwasa yayogerako n'abajaasi ba Uganda ku nsonga za South Africa.
Major General Steven Kashaka asked him to help establish contact with Kagame.	Maja Genero Steven Kashaka yamusaba awuliziganye ne Kagame.
Kashaka consulted President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and sought his guidance.	Kashaka yeebuuza ku pulezidenti wa Uganda Museveni amuwe ku magezi.
It seems Museveni gave it a go ahead.	Kirabika ekyo Museveni yakisemba.
Kashaka then contacted Kigali and delivered the message that Kayumba wanted to “talk”.	Kashaka yasindika obubaka e Kigali nti Kayumba ayagala “kwogera”.
Why then was Kagame skeptical when informed of this effort?	Lwaki Kagame yafunamu okwekengera nga bamutegeezezza ku nsonga eyo?
The July nineteenth to twenty first, African Union summit in Kampala was hijacked by the July eleventh terror attacks by the Al-Shabaab jihadists.

Kony is still desperate and determined to meet Makas with whatever he is carrying.	Kony akyayagala nnyo okusisinkana Makas na buli kimu ky'asitudde.
He is also sure that if Makas succeeds to meet him, it will restore some commanders’ hope that Kony could still command.	Era mukakafu nti Makas ajja kusobola okumusisinkana, kimukakase nti ddala Kony akyasobola okuduumira.
Otherwise Makas’s failure to meet Kony could he disastrous to his command and control capabilities	Naye singa Makas alemwa okusisinkana Kony kiba kiraga nti eby'obuduumizi bimuvudde mu ngalo.
If Makas loses everything, the meeting could be a boost to Kony.	Makas bw'afiirwa buli kimu, ensisinkano eyo eyinza okwongera Kony amaanyi.

Since President Paul Kagame's recent election victory, the majority of Rwandans in and outside the country have been in festive mood.	Bukya Pulezidenti Paul Kagame awangula kulonda gye buvuddeko awo, Abanyarwanda abasinga obungi mu Rwanda n'ebweru waayo bali mu kujaganya.

On the night the election results were announced, I was in the Belgium capital, Brussels.	Ku lunaku ebyava mu kulonda lwe byalangirirwa, nnali mu Brussels, ekibuga ekikulu ekya Bubirigi.
Brussels is a key site of anti Kagame and anti Rwanda Patriotic Front activism.	Mu Brussels mulimu bangi abavumirira Kagame ne gavumenti y'e Rwanda.
Television Rwanda showed scenes of jubilation as the thousands of people in and outside Amahoro stadium sang, danced and cheered.	Ttivvi y'e Rwanda yalaga abantu bangi nga bajaganyiza munda ne wabweru w'ekisaawe ky'e Amahoro.
President Kagame, his family and a host of government officials, were seen swinging to the music as the clock ticked towards dawn.	Pulezidenti Kagame, ab'omu maka ge, n'abakungu ba gavumenti abawerako baalagibwa nga nabo bajaganya ng'eno obudde bwe bugenda buwungeera.
I was with fans and a few critics of President Kagame, his government and his party the Rwanda Patriotic Front.	Nnali wamu n'abawagizi ba Pulezidenti Kagame, gavumenti ye, n'ekibiina kye ekya Rwanda Patriotic Front, era waaliwo n'abatonotono abaali batamumatira.
He bragged about being the first member of the local Rwandan Diaspora to cast his vote the previous day.	Yeewana ng'omu ku Bannyarwanda abaasooka okusuula akalulu jjo.
Critics and admirers of Kagame rarely agree on anything.	Kizibu abo abawakanya Kagame n'abamuwagira okukkaanya ku nsonga yonna.
The general argument that having a sense of humor and giving in to simple pleasures were not for which Kagame is famous.	Bangi baagamba nti Kagame tamanyiddwa kuba muntu asaaga oba asanyukamu.
I was watching television Rwanda on the internet and the scenes of jubilation were truly disarming.	Nnali ndaba ttivi y'e Rwanda ku intaneeti naye bye nnalaba byali byawukana ku ebyo bye baali bamwogerako.
The few voices, mainly of Rwandan officials and local columnists seek to tell the other side of the story.	Abantu abatonotono, nnaddala abakungu mu Rwanda n'abawandiisi b'olupapula lw'amawulire mu Rwanda, bo balaga kirala .
They were literally drowned in stories claiming that Rwanda was growing into a typical African dictatorship.	Baali bettanira nnyo emboozi ezigamba nti gavumenti ya Rwanda yali efuuse ya nnakyemalira.
The critics insisted that Kagame had no interest in opening up what they saw as restricted political space.	Baagamba nti Kagame tayagala kugaba buyinza.
The Kagame government had no interest in allowing “the real opposition” or “the main opposition parties” from competing for power.	Gavumenti ya Kagame teyali nneetegefu kukkiriza bibiina bya bufuzi eby'amaanyi ebiwakanya gavumenti ye kuvuganya ku buyinza.
They were literally drowned in stories claiming that Rwanda was growing into a typical African dictatorship.	Bettanira nnyo emboozi ezaali zigamba nti gavumenti ya Rwanda yali efuuse ya nnakyemalira.
A common critique of the Kagame regime is “the climate of fear”.	Ekimu kye basinga okuvumirira ku bukulembeze bwa Kagame kiri nti aleeseewo okutya kungi mu bantu.
Kagame regime has allegedly created fear to intimidate whoever wishes to engage in “real debate” about the situation in the country.	Gavumeni ya Kagame etiisa buli omu agezaako okugiwakanya mu ngeri yonna.
"The critics claim that the climate of fear, has turned Rwanda into “a volcano""."	Abavumirira Kagame bagamba nti embeera eyo ey'okutya ereetedde Rwanda okuba ng'olusozi oluwandula omuliro.
Rwanda is to “erupt anytime” into mass violence and possibly another genocide.	Rwanda etuuse okubalukamu obwegugungo obw'amaanyi sinakindi okuddamu okubaamu ekittabantu.
Rwandans know that neither President Kagame nor the Rwanda Patriotic Front or the Rwanda government are without fault or weakness.	Abanyarwanda bakimanyi nti Pulezidenti Kagame, ekibiina kye ekya RPF, oba gavumenti ya Rwanda tebasobola kuba nga tebaliiko kya kunenyezebwa.
If one spent time talking to Rwandans about several aspects of government and public life, they would be seen as complaining.	Singa omuntu yenna ayogera n'Abanyarwanda ku gavumenti oba ku mbeera y'obulamu bw'abantu, atandika okutwalibwa ng'eyeemulugunya.
Those whose knowledge of Rwanda is limited have a tendency of disregarding context.	Abo abatamanyi bifa mu Rwanda batera obutalowooza ku byonna bizingirwamu.
Critics who know Rwanda well, are often guilty of willful distortion and twisting of facts to suit their purpose.	Abavumirira gavumenti abamanyi obulungi ebifa mu Rwanda, emirundi mingi banyoolanyoola amazima basobole okutuuka ku biruubirirwa byabwe.
Rwanda is often portrayed as a country in the grip of a suffocating monopoly of power by the Rwanda Patriotic Front.	Batera okuwa ekifaananyi  nti Rwanda efugibwa ekibiina kya RPF ekikajjala ku bantu.
It is true that the Rwanda Patriotic Front is an overwhelmingly powerful political organization.	Kyo kituufu nti ekibiina kya RPF kya maanyi nnyo.
The most powerful was the National Revolutionary Movement for Development, the former ruling party.	Ekibiina ekisinga amaanyi kye kya National Revolutionary Movement for Development, ekyaliko mu buyinza.
The party leaders organized and arranged the genocide and mass murder of the early one thousand nine hundred nineties.	Abakulembeze b'ekibiina ekyo be baategeka ekittabantu ku ntandikwa y'emyaka gya 1990.
The Arusha grants obliged the signatories to share power.	Endgaano y'e Arusha yeetaagisa abaagissaako omukono okugabana obuyinza.
Given its military might, the Rwanda Patriotic Front could have easily opted to rule alone and sideline or even ban other parties.	Okusinziira ku maanyi ge kirina, ekibiina kya RPF kyali kisobola okusalawo okufuga kyokka ne kisambajja oba ne kiwera ebibiina ebirala.
The country wide consultations led to the making of the post genocide constitution of two thousand three.	Okwebuuza ku bantu okwetoola eggwanga kwaviirako okukola ssemateeka mu 1993.
The majority of Rwandans argued against the return to multi party politics on grounds that parties had created the instability.	Abanyarwanda abasinga obungi baawakanya eky'okuzzaawo ebibiina by'obufuzi ebingi nga bagamba nti byali bireetawo obutali butebenkevu.
The Rwanda Patriotic Font could have easily capitalized on this anti party mood and barred political parties.	Ekibiina kya RPF kyali kisobola okukozesa akakisa ako okuwera ebibiina by'obufuzi ebirala.
The consultations ran alongside elite focused consultative meetings presided over by then President, Pasteur Bizimungu.	Okwebuuza kuno kwaliwo mu kiseera kye kimu n'enkungaana ezitali zimu ezaabangamu abantu abagagga ezaakubirizibwa Pulezidenti, Pasteur Bizimungu.
The consultations included clergy, notwithstanding the soiled image of the church at the Rwandan secrets. 	Okwebuuza kuno kwazingiramu n'abakulembeze b'amadiini, abaali batasobola kugumira linnya bbi ekkanisa lye yali ekoze mu Rwanda.
Some are directly responsible for its dirty history but are now determined to build a “new Rwanda”.	Abamu ku bo beenyigira ne mu bikolwa ebibi ekkanisa bye yakola naye nga kati bamalirivu okuzimba “Rwanda  empya”.
The Rwanda Patriotic Front has run the country in cooperation with seven other political parties.	Ekibiina kya RPF kikoledde wamu n'ebibiina by'obufuzi ebirala musanvu mu kuddukanya eggwanga.
The Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party were both founded in opposition to the Habyarimana regime.	Ekibiina kya Liberal Party n'ekya Social Democratic Party byatandikibwawo kulwanyisa bufuzi bwa Habyarimana.
The Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party were both founded in the early one thousand nine hundred nineties.	Ekibiina kya Liberal Party n'ekya Social Democratic Party byombi byatandikibwawo ku ntandikwa y'emyaka gya 1990.
Both sponsored candidates to run against President Kagame in the recent elections.	Byombi byasimbawo abantu okuvuganya Pulezidenti Kagame mu kulonda okuwedde.
The Rwanda Patriotic Front candidate was welcomed as a sign of growing political maturity in the country’s politics.	Oyo eyali yeesimbyewo ku kaadi y'ekibiina kya RPF yayanirizibwa ng'akabonero akalaga okukula mu by'obufuzi by'eggwanga.
One of them is Imberakuri, founded by Bernard Ntaganda.	Ekimu ku byo ye Imberakuri, ekyatandikibwawo Bernard Ntaganda.
Ntaganda and some of his supporters ended up in jail on criminal charges.	Ntaganda n'abamu ku bawagizi be baasibwa nga babalanga kumenya mateeka.
Inkingi of Victoire Ingabire and Democratic Green Party of Frank Habineza, have been denied permission to participate in elections as presidential candidates.	Ab'ekibiina kya Inkingi ekya Victoire Ingabire n'ab'ekibiina kya Democratic Green Party ekya Frank Habineza, baalemesebwa okusimbawo omuntu okuvuganya ku bwa pulezidenti.
The real opposition criticized President Kagame and the government for their failure to secure permission to register.	Ab'oludda oluvuganya baanenya Pulezidenti Kagame ne gavumenti nti be baabalemesa okuwandiisa abantu baabwe.
What Kagame’s critics have not bothered to do is examine and debate the reasons why the government has given for its decision.	Naye abo abavumirira Kagame tebafuddeeyo kumanya nsonga lwaki gavumenti yasalawo okukola ekintu ekyo.
In two thousand six, those restrictions were relaxed.	Mu 2006, obukwakulizo obwo bwakkakkanyizibwamu.
Rob Walker is a journalist.	Rob Walker munnamawulire.
What distinguishes Rwanda from its neighbours is the real climate of fear.	Enjawulo wakati wa Rwanda ku mawanga agagiriraanye y'embeera ey'okutya eri mu ggwanga.
Mr. Walker, who was in Rwanda on temporary assignment, is not alone in making these claims.	Mw. Walker, eyali agenze e Rwanda okubaako emirimu gy'akola, si ye yekka agamba ekyo.
Until the early one thousand nine hundred nineties, pre Rwanda Patriotic Font Rwanda was a one party, half military.	Okutuusa ku ntandikwa y'emyaka gya 1990, Rwanda yali efugibwa kibiina kya bufuzi kimu na magye.
The Rwanda Patriotic Front’s path to power was for most Rwandans, their first introduction to war on grand scale.	Okuggya kwa RPF mu buyinza Abanyarwanda bangi bagamba nti kwe kwaleeta olutalo olukyasinzeeyo obunene olwasookera ddala mu Rwanda.
The war lasted in the late one thousand nine hundred nineties, leaving many death and mass disruption.	Olutalo olwo lwagendera ddala okutuuka ku nkomerero y'emyaka gya 1990 era lwafiiramu abantu bangi n'ebintu bingi byayonooneka.
It was a war that few inside the country had expected the Rwandan Patriotic Front to win.	Bantu batono nnyo abaali balowooza nti eggye lya RPF lyali lisobola okuwangula.
This is not the fear critics of Kagame and the Government of Rwanda had in mind.	Okwo si kwe kutya abo abavumirira Kagame ne gavumenti ya Rwanda kwe boogerako.
What they mean is that there are on going efforts by the state and President Kagame to intimidate the citizens.	Kye bagamba kiri nti waliwo kaweefube agenda mu maaso gavumenti ne Pulezidenti Kagame gwe baliko nga bagenderera okutiisatiisa abantu.

Fortirwari Karamira  was a Tutsi and member of the Republic Democratic Movement party of Faustin Twagiramungu in Rwanda.	Fortirwari Karamira  yali Mutuusi era nga wa kibiina kya Republic Democratic Movement ekya Faustin Twagiramungu mu Rwanda.
In 1992, he renounced his Tutsi identity, declared himself a Hutu and became one of the extremist Hutu supremacists.	Mu 1992, yagamba nti yali takyali Mutuusi, n'agamba nti ye Muhutu, era ne yeegatta ku kibinja ky'Abahutu bannalukalala.
He split from Republic Democratic Movement to lead its extremist wing.	Yeekutula ku kibiina kya Republic Democratic Movement asobole okukulembera ekiwayi kyako ekya bannalukalala.
Karamira then organised the worst massacres of the Tutsi.	Oluvannyuma, Karamira yateekateeka ekittabantu omwafiira omuwendo gw'Abatuusi ogukyasinzeeyo obunene.
The head of the Interahamwe that headed the genocide was Kajuga, a Tutsi who had made himself Hutu.	Kajuga, ye yali omukulembeze w'ekibiina kya Interahamwe ekyawoma omutwe mu kittabantu, era naye yagamba nti takyali Mutuusi nti kati yali Muhutu.
Basic knowledge of Rwanda would show 500 years of intermarriage and other social mechanisms of status change.	Ebyafaayo bya Rwanda biraga nti Abanyarwanda baamala emyaka 500 ng'abantu b'amawanga ag'enjawulo bafumbiriganwa ne kiba nti amawanga ago kumpi gaali gafuuse ggwanga limu.
The Habyarimana government had to rigidly enforce an Identity Card system.	Gavumenti ya Habyarimana yalina okukaka abantu okufuna ndagamuntu.
Many Hutu supremacists have actually been married to Tutsi women.	Ekituufu kiri nti bangi ku bannalukalala Abahutu baali bawasizza abakazi Abatuusi.
Former president Gregory Kayibanda was married to a Tutsi.	Eyaliko Pulezidenti wa Rwanda, Gregory Kayibanda,yali yawasa mukazi Mutuusi.
Karisiti Habimenshi was one of the leaders of the 1959 Hutu revolution.	Karisiti Habimenshi yali omu ku bakulembeze mu nkyukakyuka ezaakolebwa Abahutu mu 1959.
Till his death, Karisiti Habimenshi took pride in having helped defeat Tutsi rebels in the 1960s.	Okutuusa lwe yafa, Karisiti Habimenshi yali yeenyumiriza nnyo mu ky'okuba nti yawangula abayeekera Abatuusi mu myaka gya 1960.
His wife is Tutsi.	Mukyala we Mutuusi.
Kayibanda’s ethnic revolution against the Tutsi could not have been because he hated them but because it was politically move for him.	Mu kulwanyisa Abatuusi abo, Kayibanda teyakikola lwa kuba nti yabalinako obukyayi naye yakikola lwa nsonga za bya bufuzi .
Social relations across the Hutu-Tutsi divide are even more complicated when you dig deep into Rwanda’s social structure.	Enkolagana wakati w'Abahutu n'Abatuusi era yeeyongera okuba enzibu okutegeera bw'olondoola engeri abantu mu Rwanda gye bazze bakolaganamu.
Michel Makuza is father of the current prime minister of Rwanda Bernard Makuza.	Michel Makuza ye taata wa ssaabaminisita wa Rwanda aliko, Bernard Makuza.
He was the intellectual leader of the 1959 “revolution” and a close Kayibanda ally.	Y'omu ku baali abawi b'amagezi mu kulwana okwaliwo mu 1959 era yali nfanfe wa Kayibanda.
He was married to a Tutsi and some people claim that his wife was a distant relative of President Paul Kagame.	Mukazi we yali Mutuusi era abamu bagamba nti mukazi we alina oluganda olwewala ku Pulezidenti Paul Kagame.
The wife of the late Seth Sendashonga is also said to be Tutsi and distantly related to Kagame.	Mukyala w'omugenzi Seth Sendashonga naye kigambibwa nti Mutuusi era nti alina oluganda olwewala ku Kagame.
It is hard to find a “pure” Hutu or Tutsi or one without relatives in the other group.	Kizibu okusanga Omuhutu oba Omutuusi yennyini, atalina banganda mu limu ku mawanga ago.
The story of deep ethnic hatreds between Hutu and Tutsi is a myth.	Ebyo ebigambibwa nti Abahutu n'Abatuusi beerinako obukyayi bungi tebiriiko mutwe na magulu.
Take the example of Rwanda in 1994.	Lowooza ku byaliwo mu Rwanda mu 1994.
The Habyarimana regime had sought to create a mass awareness among the Hutu against Tutsi ever gaining power in that country.	Gavumenti ya Habyarimana yafuba nnyo okukunga Abahutu obutakkirizanga Batuusi kufuga ggwanga.
However, the Hutu were not homogenous themselves.	Naye Abatuusi be yali agamba nabo baali ba musaayi mutabike.
Habyarimana came from the north which under colonial rule had provided soldiers to the army.	Habyarimana yali asibuka mu bitundu by'ebukiikakkono ebyavaamu abasirikale b'eggye ly'eggwanga mu kiseera ky'abafuzi b'amatwale.
He had overthrown Kayibanda from the south which under colonial rule had produced the educated.	Yali yawangula Kayibanda eyasibuka mu bukiikaddyo omwali muva abantu abayivu mu kiseera ky'abafuzi b'amatwale.
Political tribalism in Africa is as modern as the ipad, created and recreated by elites daily.	Eby'obufuzi ebyesigamiziddwa ku mawanga bipya nnyo mu Afirika nga bw'olaba ipad, era bitandikibwawo abantu abeetwala okuba aba waggulu.
Do the Hutu and Tutsi of Rwanda nurse ancient hatred?	Ddala Abahutu n'Abatuusi mu Rwanda balina obukyayi bwonna obuvudde edda?
Habyarimana began his rule by eliminating the southern intellectuals including starving Kayibanda to death.	Habyarimana obufuzi bwe yabutandika na kufuba kusaanyaawo abantu abayivu ab'omu bukiikaddyo, nga muno mwe mwali n'okulumya Kayibanda enjala okutuusa lwe yafa.
This set divisions among Hutu of the north against Hutu from the south.	Ekyo kyaleetawo enjawukana wakati w'Abahutu ab'omu bukiikakkono n'ab'omu bukiikaddyo.
As Habyarimana’s rule consolidated, Hutu were divided further this time along clan.	Obufuzi bwa Habyarimana bwe bweyongera okukakata, enjawukana mu Bahutu zeeyongera ku luno ne zizingiramu n'ebika.
Habyarimana was a Mushiru and his regime was seen in that light.	Habyarimana yali ava mu kika kya Mushiru era ne gavumenti ye bw'etyo bwe yali etunuulirwa.
Power increasingly went into the hands of Habyarimana's village mates and in-laws from Gisenyi in north-western Rwanda.	Abantu b'oku kyalo Habyarimana gy'ava n'ab'okukyalo kya Gisenyi gye yajja omukyala, beeyongera okuweebwa ebifo mu gavumenti.
So the contours of division now went along clan lines and districts of origin.	Ekyo kyaviirako enjawukana okulanda ne zizingiramu ebika ne disitulikiti abantu gye basibuka.
Hutu from other districts began Habyarimana of creating akazu (kitchen cabinet).	Abahutu mu disitulikiti endala baatandika okunenya Habyarimana olw'okusosola mu bantu.
There emerged the MDR which was the old Premahutu party of Kayibanda and led by Faustin Twagiramungu.	Ekibiina kya MDR kyatandikibwawo nga kino emabega kye kyali ekibiina kya Kayibanda ekyali kikulemberwa Faustin Twagiramungu.
In fact Twagiramungu’s wife is a daughter to Kayibanda.	Mu butuufu, mukyala wa Twagiramungu muwala wa Kayibanda.
There came the Social Democatic Party.	Oluvannyuma ekibiina kya Social Democatic Party nakyo kyatandikibwawo.
Then came the Liberal Party led by Lando Ndasingwa, the only Tutsi in Habyarimana’s cabinet.	Oluvannyuma wajjawo ekibiina kya Liberal Party ekikulemberwa Lando Ndasingwa, ng'ono ye Mutuusi yekka eyali mu kabineeti ya Habyarimana.
These political parties became signatories of the Arusha Peace Accords signed in 1993.	Ebibiina by'obufuzi ebyo byassa omukono ku ndagaano y'emirembe ey'e Arusha mu 1993.
The principles to the agreement were Habyarimana’s  Republic Democratic Movement and Rwandan Patriotic Front would take 40 percent of the positions in government .	Ebibiina ebyali bisinga amaanyi mu ebyo ebyassa omukono ku ndagaano eyo, ekya Habyarimana ekiyitibwa Republic Democratic Movement n'ekyo ekiyitibwa Rwandan Patriotic Front byali bya kutwala ebitundu 40 ku buli kikumi eky'ebifo mu gavumenti.
Within the context of Rwandan politics at the time, the main adversary of the opposition parties was Habyarimana.	Okusinziira ku byafaayo by'eby'obufuzi bya Rwanda mu kiseera ekyo, Habyarimana ye yali omulabe omukulu ow'ebibiina by'obufuzi.
Because he controlled the army, the effective way to challenge Habyarimana’s power was to ally with Rwandan Patriotic Front because it had the military capacity to counter him.	Okuva bwe kiri nti Habyarimana yalina obuyinza ku magye, engeri yokka ey'okuvuganya Habyarimana kwali kukola mukago na kibiina kya Rwandan Patriotic Front kubanga nakyo kyalina obuyinza obumala ku ggye nga kisobola okumulwanyisa.
So the Republican Democratic Movement, Social Democratic Party and Liberal Party entered an informal understanding with the Rwandan Patriotic Front for cooperation.	Bwe kityo, ekibiina kya Republican Democratic Movement, ekya Social Democratic Party, n'ekya Liberal Party  byatuuka ku nzikiriziganya n'ekibiina kya Rwandan Patriotic Front okukolera awamu.
This understanding realigned politics in Rwanda.	Omukago ogwo gwakyusa nnyo eby'obufuzi mu Rwanda.
Habyarimana realised that in the ensuing government of national unity, his party would be in a minority.	Habyarimana yakiraba nti omukago gw'ebibiina bino gwali gugenda kuleetera ekibiina kye okuba n'ebifo bitonoko mu gavumenti.
Parties like the Republican Democratic Movement had calculated that given its Tutsi ethnic base, combined with the effectiveness of the ideology of Hutu power, Rwandan Patriotic Front stood no chance of winning the planned election.	Ebibiina gamba ng'ekya Republican Democratic Movement byali biraba nti olw'okuba RPF yalimu ab'eggwanga ly'Abatuusi bangi, ate ng'Abahutu balina obuyinza bungi, RPF yali tesobola kuwangula kulonda okwali kujja.
If they could use Rwandan Patriotic Front's military power and add unto it their electoral strength, they would be able to gain and hold power.	Baakiraba nti singa bakozesa obuyinza RPF bwe yalina ku magye ne babugattako amaanyi amatono ge baalina baali basobola okuwangula.
But Habyarimana and his extremist allies saw it differently.	Naye ye Habyarimana ne banne bannalukalala ebintu baali babiraba bulala.
They realised that Rwandan Patriotic Front was going to capture power by allying with Hutu political parties.	Baakiraba nti RPF yali egenda kuwangula ng'eyitira mu kwekobaana n'ebibiina by'obufuzi eby'Abahutu.
The understanding between Rwandan Patriotic Front and the other political parties had realigned the politics in a way that created a real possibility that Tutsi could actually get into power.	Okukwatagana wakati wa RPF n'ebibiina by'obufuzi ebirala byawa essuubi nti kati Abatuusi baali basobola okutwala obuyinza.
Habyarimana decided on a double pronged strategy.	Habyarimana yasala amagezi amalala.
First, he created Coalition for the Defence of the Republic, a Hutu extremist political party as his fifth column.	Ekisooka, yassaawo ekibiina kya Coalition for the Defence of the Republic, nga kino kyalimu Abatuusi bannalukalala.
Coalition for the Defence of the Republic argued that Rwanda is for the Hutu only.	Ab'ekibiina kya Coalition for the Defence of the Republic baali bagamba nti ensi ya Rwanda ya Bahutu bokka.
Initially, the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic rejected all the Arusha Accords and was actually excluded from the power sharing arrangement.	Mu kusooka, ab'ekibiina kya Coalition for the Defence of the Republic kyagaana endagaano y'e Arusha era tekyarowoozebwako mu ngabana y'obuyinza.
But when this became clearly untenable, Coalition for the Defence of the Republic supported by Habyarimana began demanding inclusion.	Naye bwe baakiraba  nti eyo tewaali lugendo, ab'ekibiina kya Coalition for the Defence of the Republic  ekyali kiwagirwa Habyarimana baatandika okusaba nabo bateekebwe mu ndagaano eyo.
The aim was to dilute the strength of Rwandan Patriotic Front and its allies.	Ekigendererwa kyali kya kunafuya maanyi ga mukago gwa RPF n'ebibiina ebirala.
Secondly, Habyarimana encouraged divisions within the other political parties causing them to split between their moderate and extremist wings.	Eky'okubiri, Habyarimana yafuba okuleetawo enjawukana mu bibiina by'obufuzi ebirala.
In the ensuing contest, the extremists joined Habyarimana while the moderates leaned to the Rwandan Patriotic Front.	N'ekyavaamu, bannalukalala abaali mu bibiina ebyo baasalawo okwegatta ku Habyarimana ate abo abaagala okukwata ebintu obulungi baanywerera ku RPF.
These contestations caused the failure to swear in the government of national unity on five occasions from December 1993 to April 1994 when Habyarimana was killed.	Emirundi etaano, embiranyi eyo eyaliwo yakaandaaliriza eky'okukwasa gavumenti ey'awamu obuyinza, era embeera yali bw'etyo okuva mu Ddesemba 1993 okutuuka mu Apuli 1994 Habyarimana bwe yattibwa.
Now, under the terms of the ceasefire, the Rwandan Patriotic Front had been made to withdraw from its occupied territories to its area before the May 1993 offensive.	Kati okusinziira ku byali mu bukwakulizo obw'okussa wansi eby'okulwanyisa, RPF yawalirizibwa okuva mu bifo bye yali ewambye n'eddayo mu bifo bye yalimu ng'okulwana tekunnatandika mu Maayi 1993.
The areas from which the  Rwandan Patriotic Front withdrew were declared a demilitarised zone under the United Nations which organised local elections.	Ebifo RPF mwe yava byalangirirwa nti tebirina kubaamu magye era nti byali wansi w'ekibiina ky'Amawanga Amagatte ekyategeka okulonda mu Rwanda.
Although all parties were free to participate, only the Republican Democratic Movement and Rwandan Patriotic Front fielded candidates.	Wadde ng'ebibiina byonna byali bikkirizibwa okwenyigiramu, ekibiina kya Republican Democratic Movement n'ekya RPF bye byokka ebyasimbawo abantu.
Rwandan Patriotic Front sent its Hutu leaders like Sendashonga, Bizimungu and Kanyarengwe to campaign on its behalf.	Ekibiina kya RPF kyasindika abakulembeze baakyo Abahutu gamba nga Sendashonga, Bizimungu, ne Kanyarengwe okukikubira kampeyini.
In a surprising and shocking turn of events,Rwandan Patriotic Front won all the local seats except for the top job of burgo master which was won by Republican Democratic Movement.	Ekyewuunyisa kiri nti ekibiina kya RPF kyawangula ebifo byonna okuggyako ekifo eky'oku ntikko ekyawangulwa ekibiina kya Republican Democratic Movement.
When a contingent of the Rwandan Patriotic Front military was sent to Kigali as agreed in Arusha, people lined up the streets cheering its entry.	Ababaka b'eggye lya RPF bwe baasindikibwa e Kigali nga bwe kyali kikkaanyiziddwako mu Arusha, abantu baasimba ku makubo ne babasanyukira nnyo.
These incidents changed the strategies of the architects of Hutu power.	Ebyo ebyaliwo byakiraga nti akakodyo Abahutu ke baali bakozesa kaali keetaaga okukyusibwa.
They had succeeded in creating a widely shared social consciousness among elites and even ordinary Hutu that the Tutsi have no right to rule in Rwanda.	Baali basobodde okuleetera Abatuusi ab'amaanyi n'aba bulijjo okulowooza nti Abatuusi tebaggwana kufuga Rwanda.
Short of genocide, their campaign to create a permanent wedge between Hutu and Tutsi would never succeed.	Baakiraba nti singa tewabaawo kittabantu, kaweefube gwe baaliko ow'okuleetawo enjawukana ez'enkalakkalira wakati w'Abahutu n'Abatuusi yali ajja kugwa butaka.
Therefore, genocide was not born of some entrenched hatred of Tutsi by Hutu.	N'olwekyo, ekittabantu tekyava ku kuba nti waaliwo obukyayi obwali buvudde edda wakati w'Abatuusi n'Abahutu.
If the architects of Hutu power were convinced that there was not a chance that Hutu and Tutsi would create an alliance, they would not have sought a “final solution.	Singa abo baali batumbula endowooza nti Abahutu be balina okufuga baali bakakafu nti Abahutu n'Abatuusi tebasobola kukola mukago, bandibadde tebasala ggezi ddala.
Why then did masses of ordinary Hutu civilians pick machetes to kill Tutsi who were their friends, neighbours and relatives?	Kati olwo lwaki Abahutu aba bulijjo bangi baakwata ebijambiya okutta Abatuusi abaali mikwano gyabwe, baliraanwa baabwe, era nga babalinako oluganda?
Many people believe that Hutu turned out in groups to kill Tutsi out of hatred.	Abantu bangi balowooza nti Abahutu bangi baasalawo okutta Abatuusi olw'okuba baabalinako obukyayi.
The architects of the genocide put a price on the head of any Hutu who did not participate which was DEATH.	Abaali emabega w'ekittabantu baagamba nti Omuhutu yenna ateenyigira mu kittabantu yali ajja kuttibwa.
Secondly, many Hutu were told that if Tutsi came, they would be exterminated.	Eky'okubiri, Abahutu bangi baagambibwa nti singa Abatuusi bajja, bajja kutta Abahutu babasaanyeewo.
So many Hutu joined the bandwagon in a perverted search for preemptive self defence.	N'olwekyo, Abahutu bangi baasalawo okwenyigira mu kittabantu nga balowooza nti beetaasa.
Therefore, genocide was not born of some entrenched hatred of Tutsi by Hutu.	N'olwekyo, ekittabantu tekyava ku kuba nti waaliwo obukyayi wakati w'Abatuusi n'Abahutu obwali buvudde emabega.
These subtle reasons never find expression in both the pro and anti Rwandan Patriotic Front literature largely because of the complexity of the problem.	Ensonga zino tezitera kwogerwako mu bitabo ebikwata ku Rwanda, naddala olw'obuzibu obw'amaanyi bwe zaaleetawo.
This background explains why it has been possible for Rwanda to achieve a large measure of reconciliation.	Okumanya ensonga ezo kiyamba mu kutegeera lwaki RPF esobodde okuleetawo okutabagana mu bantu bangi mu ggwanga.
It also sheds light on why Rwandan Patriotic Front has been able to consolidate itself in power.	Era kituyamba okulaba lwaki RPF esobodde okwenywereza mu buyinza.
Kagame can easily win a free and fair election in Rwanda in spite of being Tutsi in a major-ty Hutu electorate.	Kagame asobola bulungi okuwangula akalulu akategekeddwa mu bwenkanya n'amazima mu Rwanda wadde nga ye Mutuusi ate ng'Abahutu bangi mu ggwanga.
The death last week of the former Ugandan president Godfrey Binaisa marks the start of the end of an era in Ugandan politics dominated by politicians who were born in the early 1900.	Wiiki ewedde, okufa kw'eyaliko pulezidenti wa Uganda, Godfrey Binaisa, kwalaga nti ekiseera ky'abantu abaazaalibwa ku ntandikwa y'emyaka gya 1900 okwefuga eby'obufuzi bya Uganda kitandise okuggwaako.
The death in April 2007 of the Secretary for Defence, Brig. Noble Mayombo, should have attracted con-tinuous, hour by hour media coverage than the death of Binaisa.	Okufa kw'omuwandiisi w'ekitongole ky'eby'okwerinda, Brig. Noble Mayombo, mu Apuli 2007 kwandibadde kusikiriza nnyo emikutu gy'amawulire okusinga okufa kwa Binaisa.

Makerere academic staff voted to go on strike until their savings with the National Insurance Corporation is properly accounted for.	Abasomesa b'e Makerere baasalawo okwediima okutuusa nga ssente zaabwe mu NIC zikoleddwako.
More than five hundred workers have their savings with the National Insurance Corporation.	Abakozi abasukka mu bitaano balina ssente zaabwe mu NIC.

Up to now, in most areas of Uganda, the registers of voters have not yet been displayed so that voters can inspect them.	N'okutuusa kati, mu bitundu bya Uganda ebisinga, enkalala z'abalonzi tezinnatimbibwa balonzi kuzeekenneenya.
This is a requirement of the law which the Electoral Commission is most reluctant to apply and besides, the final voters’ registers have not arrived in the country.	Ekyo kyetaagisa mu mateeka naye ekitongole ky'eby'okulonda kironzalonza okukissa mu nkola, ate okugatta ku ekyo enkalala z'okulonda ez'enkomeredde tezinnatuuka mu ggwanga.
What registers are to be used in a country like Uganda, where there is rampant scandalous use of government media and the government daily newspaper by one political party?	Nkalala za ngeri ki ezisaanidde okukozesebwa mu ggwanga nga Uganda, emikutu gy'empuliziganya n'empapula z'amawulire ebya gavumenti gye bikozesebwa mu ngeri ya kyekubiira okuwagira ekibiina ekimu?
These media trumpet Uganda People's Congress daily as if no other party exists.	Emikutu egyo gyogera nnyo ku UPC nga gy'obeera kye kibiina kyokka ekiri mu ggwanga.
Every night, troops are deployed to display Obote’s pictures in towns and to pull down publicity materials of other parties.	Buli kiro, amagye gayungulwa mu kibuga okutimba ebipande bya Obote n'okutimbulula ebipande by'ebibiina ebirala.
This is the case in all those towns where Uganda Liberation Army is to be found.	Ekyo kye kikolebwa mu bibuga byonna omuli amagye ga Uganda Liberation Army.
The world and Uganda particularly is being told that elections are being held in Uganda.	Ensi yonna ne mu Uganda mwennyini abantu bagambibwa nti mu Uganda mulimu okulonda.
The following article was published in the Weekly Topic, a Uganda publication, on Monday December 8th, 1980.	Ekitundu kino kyafulumira mu lupapula oluyitibwa, Weekly Topic, olwa Uganda, nga Bbalaza Ddesemba 8, 1980.
It was a special edition since the paper was always produced every Friday of the week.	Olupapula olwo lwali lwa njawulo okuva bwe kiri nti lwafulumanga Lwakutaano.
This series is compiled and reproduced by John Njoroge. Uganda Patriotic Movement calls for fresh elections after December.	Ekitundu kino kitegekebwa John Njoroge. Ekibiina kya UPM kisaba wabeewo okulonda okulala ng'omwezi gwa Ddesemba guweddeko.
10 lists of malpractices by the same movement were published in The Independent on July 23 - 29, 2010.	Ebikolwa 10 eby'obumenyi bwa mateeka ebyakolebwa ekibiina ekyo byafulumira mu lupapula lwa Independent nga Jjulaayi 23 - 29, 2010.
How does one explain the nomination of a Uganda People's Congress candidate who cannot construct a sentence in English and disqualify a University lecturer claiming he has no English certificate?	Kisoboka kitya okuba nti baasobola okuyisaawo owa UPC atasobola wadde okumalayo sentensi emu ey'Olungereza naye ate ne basazaamu omusomesa wa yunivasite nga bagamba satifukeeti ya Lungereza?
The Chairman of the Military Commission has not seen it fit to compel the display of registers as provided for by law because Uganda People's Congress does not need it.	Ssentebe wa ekitongole ky'amagye tannalaba bwetaavu bwa kutimba nkalala ng'amateeka bwe geetaagisa kubanga UPC tennatuuka kuzeetaaga.
As a final touch to the manipulation exercise, the Chairman of the Military Commission has unlwafully dismissed the Chief Justice.	Mu kwongera okumenyera ddala amateeka, ssentebe w'ekitongole ky'amagye yasalawo okugoba Ssaabalamuzi mu ngeri emenya amateeka.
He replaced him with one whose only visible qualification is his flair for meddling in Uganda People's Congress politics.	Yamusikiza oyo alina ekisaanyizo ekimu kyokka nga kye ky'okweyingiza mu by'obufuzi by'ekibiina kya UPC.
It is however hoped that legal ethics will not permit the so called new Chief Justice to take the oath and to accept such an appointment.	Kisuubirwa nti amateeka agafuga bannamateeka tegajja kukkiriza Ssabalamuzi oyo omupya kulayizibwa na kukkiriza ofiisi eyo.
The Uganda People's Congress, led by Dr. Obote, the creator of Amin, is clamouring for a mandate from the people to form a government for the country.	Ekibiina kya UPC ekikulemberwa Dr. Obote, eyatumbula Amin, kisaba abantu okukiwa akakisa kiteekewo gavumenti eneefuga eggwanga.
And yet the Uganda People's Congress has, even up to now, failed to form its own party government.	Kyokka n'okutuusa leero, UPC ekyalemeddwa okulonda abantu abanaakola gavumenti yaayo.
The reason is fear of democracy within Uganda People's Congress itself as a party and the desire to install a one man dictatorship.	Ensonga eri nti mu UPC mwennyini batya enkola ya demokulasiya era baagaala okuteekawo gavumenti efugibwa nnakyemalira.
This is a flagrant violation of Article 7 of the Uganda People's Congress constitution.	Ekyo kiba kimenya akawayiro 7 aka ssemateeka wa UPC.
Murders and other forms of harassment are now daily occurrences.	Ettemu n'okutulugunya abantu kati bifuuse bya bulijjo.
As recently as last week, a Democratic Party candidate in Kasese was murdered and although those who were implicated in the murder are known, they are still at large free.	Mu wiiki ewedde, kandidenti wa DP e Kasese yattibwa, era wadde ng'abamutta bamanyiddwa tebakwatibwanga.
Elections cannot be free and fair while one is in the grave and his murderer,a Uganda People's Congress candidate, is going to become a Honourable Member of Parliament.	Okulonda tekusobola kuba kwa mazima na bwenkanya ng'omu ku beesimbyewo ali mu ttaka, ate ng'eyamutta, kandidenti wa UPC, agenda kufuuka memba wa paliyamenti.
The world in general and Uganda in particular must be informed that all our requests and petitions are to the Chairman of the Military Commission and to the Electoral Commission.	Okutwalira awamu ensi yonna, nnaddala Uganda erina okumanyisibwa nti ebyo byonna bye twasaba twabitegeeza Ssentebe w'ekitongole ky'amagye n'ekitongole ky'eby'okulonda.
No single instance can be cited which would show that we sought advantage for our Movement to the disadvantage of other parties.	Tewali asobola kuwa bujulizi bulaga nti twanyigiriza ebibiina ebirala okusobola okuyisaawo ebigendererwa by'ekibiina kyaffe.
We wish further to inform the world in general and Uganda in particular that our Movement has borne some extraordinary instances.	Twagala okutegeeza ensi yonna okutwalira awamu nnaddala Uganda nti ekibiina kyaffe kirina ebintu ebimu ebitali bya bulijjo bye kikoze.
We therefore call upon whoever will be in authority after 10th December 1980 to immediately set in mortion a process aimed at achieving this objective.	N'olwensonga eyo tukubiriza oyo yenna anaaba mu buyinza oluvannyuma lwa Ddesemba 10 1980 okuteekawo amangu enkola eneesobozesa ekigendererwa ekyo okutuukibwako.
The situation today just like Uganda Patriotic Movement, was accusing the ruling Military Commission of refusing to reconstitute the Electoral Commission to accommodate representatives of other parties.	Embeera eriwo leero eringa eyo eyaliwo ng'ekibiina kya UPM kivunaana ekitongole ky'amagye ekyali kifuga olw'okugaana okussaawo ekitongole ky'eby'okulonda ekitalina kyekubiira mu bibiina by'obufuzi.
The opposition today is also making similar accusations and demands and the National Resistance Movement is giving exactly the same answers as the Military Commission in 1980.	Ab'oludda oluvuganya gavumenti nabo leero balumiriza era basaba ebintu bye bimu era gavumenti ya NRM by'eyogera bifaanana n'ebyo ekitongole ky'amagye bye kyayogera mu 1980.
This was when the Uganda Patriotic Movement protested the Electroral Commission composition.	Ekyo kye kiseera aba UPM lwe beemulugunya ku bakungu b'ekitongole ky'eby'okulonda.
The opposition is accusing the current Electoral Commission of being incompetent and too partisan to organise free and fair 2011 general elections.	Ab'oludda oluvuganya gavumenti balumiriza ekitongole ky'eby'okulonda ekiriwo kati olw'okuba ne kyekubiira n'olw'okulemererwa okutegeka okulonda okwa mazima n'obwenkanya okwa 2011.
For that reason, they demand that the Electoral Commission be reconstituted to have all political parties represented.	Olw'ensonga eyo, basaba ekitongole ky'eby'okulonda kikolebwemu enkyukakyuka nga kirimu abakiise okuva mu bibiina byonna.
But President Museveni has flatly rejected the proposals the way the Military Commission rejected his similar demands in 1980.	Naye ekyo Pulezidenti Museveni yakigaana nga gavumenti eyali mu buyinza mu 1980 bwe yakola.
They claimed the Electoral Commission is composed of competent people of high integrity and that there will be no change in its membership in 1980.	Baagamba nti ekitongole ky'eby'okulonda kyalimu abantu abalina obusobozi era abeerufu era kyali tekyetaagisa kukolebwamu nkyukakyuka mu 1980.
The opposition is facing media black out instigated by the ruling National Resistance Movement.	Ekibiina kya NRM ekiri mu buyinza kiremesa ab'oludda oluvuganya gavumenti okwogerwako ku mikutu gy'empuliziganya.
That also happened during the ruling of Military Commission to the Uganda Patriotic Movement and other opposition parties in 1980.	Ekyo kyennyini ekibiina ekyali mu buyinza mu 1980 kye kyakola ekibiina kya UPM n'ebibiina ebirala ebyali bivuganya gavumenti.
The Uganda Patriotic Movement and National Resistance Movement complained of harassment by the security in 1980, the same thing it is visiting upon the opposition today.	Aba UPM n'aba NRM beemulugunya nti baali batulugunyizibwa ab'eby'okwerinda mu 1980, era ekyo kye kimu ekituuse ku b'oludda oluvuganya gavumenti leero.
The Uganda People's Movement and National Resistance Movement accused the government of Uganda and National Liberation Army of trolling the city at night, pulling down posters of the opposition parties.	Aba UPM n'aba NRM baalumiriza gavumenti ya Uganda n'eggye lya National Liberation Army okulawuna ekibuga ekiro nga bagenda batimbulula ebipande by'ab'oludda oluvuganya gavumenti.
They went ahead and posted campaign materials of Uganda People's Congress.	Baatimbanga bipande bya UPC.
The same thing has happened in all the previous elections under the National Resistance Movement.	Ekyo kyennyini kye kibaddewo mu kulonda kwonna okubaddewo wansi wa gavumenti ya NRM.
Armed security personnel have pulled down campaign posters of the opposition candidates especially of Kizza Besigye around the city at night and hung posters of National Resistance Movement.	Abasirikale batimbuludde ebipande by'ab'oludda oluvuganya nnaddala ebya  Kizza Besigye mu kibuga ekiro ne batimba ebya NRM.
After losing to President Museveni in 2001 and 2006, the Forum for Democratic Change president Dr. Besigye challenged the outcome of the presidential elections in court following alleged rigging.	Oluvannyuma lw'okuwangulwa Pulezidenti Museveni mu 2001 ne mu 2006, pulezidenti wa FDC Dr. Besigye yawakanya ebyava mu kulonda ng'agamba nti mwalimu okubba obululu.
In his petition, Dr. Besigye accused the Electoral Commission of mismanaging the electoral process and cited examples.	Mu kuwaba kwe, Dr. Besigye yalumiriza ekitongole ky'eby'okulonda nti kyalemererwa okuddukanya obulungi eby'okulonda era n'awa n'ebyokulabirako.
In both petitions in 2001 and 2006, the Supreme Court ruled that the elections were rigged and that the Electoral Commission failed to comply with the electoral law.	Mu 2001 ne mu 2006, Kkooti Ensukulumu yasalawo nti okulonda kwalimu okubba era nti ekitongole ky'eby'okulonda kyalemererwa okugobererwa amateeka agafuga okulonda.
But the court declined to annul the elections saying the final result was not affected in a substantial manner.	Naye kkooti yagaana okusazzaamu ebyava mu kulonda ng'egamba nti tebyakosebwa nnyo.
By petitioning the Supreme Court, Dr. Besigye was seeking fresh elections, just like Museveni’s party in 1980 was calling for the same.	Mu kuwaayo okusaba kwe mu kkooti ensukulumu, Dr. Besigye yali ayagala okulonda kuddibwemu, ng'era ekibiina kya Museveni bwe kyali kyagala mu 1980.
The only difference is that Museveni did not go to court.	Enjawulo yokka eriwo eri nti Museveni teyagenda mu kkooti.
He later decided to go to the bush to launch a rebellion.	Oluvannyuma yasalawo kugenda mu nsiko okuyeekera gavumenti.
The situation of the opposition in 1980 seems nearly the same today.	Embeera y'ab'oludda oluvuganya gavumenti mu1980 efaananako n'eyo eriwo leero.
Museveni’s party complained of being denied access to the media at the instigation of the state.	Ekibiina kya Museveni kyemulugunya nti gavumenti yali ekiremesa okukozesa emikutu gy'empuliziganya.
Today, many media houses especially radios and Televisions have denied opposition candidates especially Besigye, space on their airwaves upon getting “orders from above” not to host him.	"Leero, emikutu gy'empuliziganya mingi nnaddala leediyo ne TV gigaana okuwa olukusa ab'oludda oluvuganya nnaddala Besigye okugikozesa nga gigamba nti gifunye “ebiragiro okuva eri gavumenti."""
The state harassment of the opposition of 1980 seems to be replicating itself today nearly in the same form and substance.	Engeri gavumenti gy'etulugunyamu ab'oludda oluvuganya gavumenti efaanana n'engeri gavumenti gye yatulugunyaamu ab'oludda oluvuganya mu 1980.
The Independent, July 23 - 29, 2010 By Mubatsi Asinja Habati at 10:30 a.m.	Olupapula lwa Independent, Jjlaayi 23 - 29, 2010 byawandikibwa Mubatsi Asinja Habati ku ssaawa 4:30 ez'oku makya.
Samuel Bukawa, 57, is waiting at the National Social Security Fund reception to meet the officer in charge of saver benefits.	Samuel Bukawa, 57, alindirira mu kifo awatuukirwa abagenyi ku NSSF asobole okulaba oyo akola ku ssente eziterekebwa.
Sitting on the blue-cushioned reception chairs, Bukawa, is anxious to get his hands on his 16-year-old savings.	Bukawa atudde ku ntebe mu kifo awatuukirwa abagenyi nga yeesunga okufuna ssente z'amaze emyaka 16 ng'atereka.
As more people stream through the National Social Security Fund office, Bukawa, who has now been waiting for over 20 minutes, looks at me uneasily like he wants to quarrel.	Ng'abantu beeyongera okuyingira mu ofiisi ya NSSF, Bukawa, amaze eddakiika ezisukka mu 20 ng'alindirira, antunulira ng'alinga ayagala okuyomba.
In the National Social Security Fund Act, workers who save with the same are entitled to benefits if they are 50 years old, permanently incapacitated, or leaving the country permanently.	Okusinziira ku mateeka ga NSSF, abakozi abaterekayo ssente bagwana okuweebwa ssente zaabwe singa baba baweza emyaka 50, nga bafunye obulemu obw'olubeerera, oba nga bagenda okuva mu ggwanga lubeerera.
Benefits can also be claimed by a dead client’s relatives if the deceased had supported them financially.	Omuntu asobola okusaba ssente z'ow'enganda ze eyafa bw'aba nga ye yali abalabirira.
However, for the last three years, Bukawa has been incapable of receiving any of the 30 million shillings he has saved with National Social Security Fund.	Kyokka, okumala emyaka 3, Bukawa tasobodde kufuna ku ssente obukadde 30 z'amaze ebbanga ng'atereka mu kitongole kya NSSF.
Today, he is no longer gainfully employed but still has the burden to provide for nine dependants.	Leero, talina mulimu gumusasula bulungi ssente naye alina abantu mwenda ab'okulabirira.
On July 7, the committee of parliament on Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises, probed the National Social Security Fund for mismanagement.	Nga Jjulaayi 7, akakiiko ka paliyamenti kaakunya ekitongole kya NSSF olw'okubulankanya ssente z'abantu.
It was found out that by 2007 the National Socail Security Fund had lost hundreds of millions of shillings to a fraudulent racket masterminded by employees faking beneficiary claims.	Kyazuulibwa nti nga 2007 ekitongole kya NSSF kyafiirwa obukadde bwa ssente obuwerako olw'abakozi baakyo okugingirira ebiwandiiko ne bafuna ssente mu lukujjukujju.
Between December 2007 and August 2008 National Social Security Fund hired Freddie Egesa, a private investigator heading the Global Equity Services Uganda Limited.	Wakkati wa Ddesemba 2007 ne Agusito 2008 NSSF yapangisa Freddie Egesa, omunoonyereza akulira ekitongole ky'obwannannyini ekya Global Equity Services Uganda Limited.
Egesa discovered that the fund was losing 200 million Shillings every 90 days to the scam.	Egesa yakizuula nti ekitongole kya NSSf kyali kibbibwa ssente obukadde 200 buli luvannyuma lw'ennaku 90.
He explained that National Social Security Fund employees were faking claims in the names of some beneficiaries, processing the cheques and cashing them.	Yagamba nti abakozi ba NSSF baali bagingirira ebiwandiiko mu mannya g'abantu abamu be baasasulanga ssente.
After his 8 month investigation, Egesa testified in front of the Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises committee.	Oluvannyuma lw'okunoonyereza okumala emyezi 8, Egesa yawa obujulizi ku bye yali azudde.
He said that he had discovered that the unscrupulous National Social Security Fund employees had generated unclaimed beneficiary cheques to a tune of 800 million shillings.	Yagamba nti yakizuula nti abakozi ba NSSF baali bagingiridde ebiwandiiko eby'okusasulirako abantu ssente eziwerera ddala obukadde 800.
“These had become stale as the staff in the racket has failed to bank them,” Egesa said.	"Egesa yagamba nti, “Ssente ezo zeesiba abakozi abo bwe baalemererwa okuzisa mu bbanka."""
Set up in 1967, National Social Security Fund is the only social security provider for workers in the private sector and Non-Government Organisations.	Ekitongole kya NSSF ekyateekebwawo mu 1967, kye kitongole kyokka ekitereka ssente z'abakozi abatali ba gavumenti.
This is because workers in the private sector and Non-Governemental Organisations are not covered under the Uganda Government Pension Scheme.	Ekyo kiri kityo kubanga abakozi abatali ba gavumenti tebafuna pensoni.
If a new law which is being debated under the Uganda Retirement Benefits Regulatory Bill 2010, is passed, workers will for the first time in Uganda have a choice.	Singa etteeka erikwata ku bakozi abaawummula okufuna ssente erikubaganyizibwako ebirowoozo riyisibwa, guno gwe gujja okuba omulundi ogusooka mu Uganda abakozi okufuna eddembe ly'okwesalirawo.
Workers can either save with the National Social Security Fund, a government statutory body, or any private pension scheme.	Abakozi bajja kuba basobola okusalawo okutereka ssente mu NSSF, ekitongole kya gavumenti, oba mu kitongole ky'obwannannyini.
The bill was approved by cabinet in December 2009 and is awaiting debate in parliament.	Kaabineeti yasemba etteeka eryo mu Ddesemba 2009 era lirindirirwa kukubaganyizibwako birowoozo mu paliyamenti.
It seeks to break the monopoly of National Social Security Fund by spurring competition, hopes to improve the quality of service in the retirement benefits industry and pensions sector.	Lyakuyamba mu kuleetawo ebitongole ebirala ebivuganya n'ekitongole kya NSSF kibe nga si kye kyokka ekitereka ssente z'abakozi, ekijja okutumbula obuweereza obuweebwa abakozi abaawummula.
The Bill also calls for an independent regulatory authority that will regulate the establishment, management and operation of retirement benefit schemes in the country.	Etteeka eryo era lyetaagisa wassibwewo ekitongole ekitalina kyekubiira okukakasa nti ssente z'abakozi zikwatibwa bulungi mu ggwanga.
In the recent years, the National Social Security Fund has been saving the workers' savings, with no political interferance and with better service due to competion.	Ensangi zino, ekitongole kya NSSF kitereka bulungi ssente z'abakozi awatali kuyingirirwa bannabyabufuzi era kituusa obuweereza obulungi ku bantu olw'okuvuganya okwajjawo.
The regulating authority will oversee both the public and private retirement benefits and pension providers.	Ekitongole ekyo kijja kuba kirabirira ebitongole bya gavumenti n'eby'obwannannyini ebikola ku pensoni.
The bill requires pension providers to have a prudent investment policy and to pay out high rates of return to the savers.	Etteekaa lyetaagisa ebitongole ebigaba pensoni okuba n'ekitongole ekikola okunoonyereza n'okuwa abo ababiterekamu ssente amagoba agawerako.
It bars speculative investment of the savings except if they are invested in securities, or in a bank.	Likugira eky'okussa ssente mu bintu ebitakakasibwa okuggyako okuzissa mu bintu gamba nga bbanka.
A person who wants to establish a retirement benefits scheme has to apply for a licence upon payment of a fee.	Omuntu ayagala okussaawo ekitongole ekitereka ssente z'abakozi alina omutemwa gwa ssente z'alina okusooka okuwaayo nga tannaweebwa layisinsi.
Existing providers regulated by the Capital Market Authority will have to obtain new licences.	Ebitongole ebiriwo ebifugibwa Capital Market Authority nabyo bijja kwetaaga okufuna layisinsi empya.
The new pension reforms are expected to be operational in 2011.	Enkyukakyuza empya ezikwata ku pensoni zijja kutandika okukola mu 2011.
On July 23 - 29, 2010, The Independent published an analysis on how the new bill will transform the pension sector. 	Nga Jjulaayi 23 - 29, 2010, olupapula lwa Independent lwafulumya okunoonyereza okulaga engeri etteeka epya gye linaakwata ku bitongole ebitereka ssente z'abakozi.
The Finance Minister Syda Bbumba at the inauguration of the new National Social Security Fund board in October last year said inefficiencies had prevented it from offering quality services.	Bwe yali atongoza akakiiko ka NSSF akapya omwaka oguwedde, minisita w'eby'ensimbi Syda Bbumba yagamba nti obutakola bulungi mirimu gyakyo kyali kiremessezza ekitongole ekyo okuwa abantu empeereza ey'omutindo.
She said cabinet had recommended the streamlining of the regulatory framework for the pensions sector and argued the entry of other players in the sector.	Yagamba nti kabineeti yasemba eky'okulambika obulungi entambuza y'emirimu mu bitongole ebitereka ssente z'abakozi n'okukkiriza ebitongole ebirala okukola omulimu ogwo.
She added that this would not spell doom for National Social Security Fund unless the management fails to follow good practice.	Yagattako nti ekyo kyali tekijja kusuula kitongole kya NSSF mu buzibu okuggyako ng'abakikulira balemeddwa okukola ekibasuubirwamu.
With a liberalised pension sector, employees and employers will be free to choose their pension providers and it should enable workers to benefit and have reasonable interest on their savings.	Enkyukakyuka ezo zijja kuwa abakozi n'ababakozesa akakisa okwesalirawo kitongole ki ekinaabaterekera ssente zaabwe era kijja kusobozesa abakozi okuganyulwa mu ssente ze batereka n'okuzifunamu amagoba.
Various service providers for individual retirement schemes will also be opened and it will be the job of their trustees, custodians and administrators to ensure that the scheme operates optimally.	Ebitongole ebirala nabyo bijja kukkirizibwa okutereka ssente z'abakozi era kijja kuba eri ababiddukanya n'abalala ababivunaanyizibwako okukakasa  nti bikola bulungi emirimu gyabyo.
“The proposed liberalisation of Uganda’s pension sector is a welcome gesture,” says Ibrahim Okumu, an economist with Makerere University’s Faculty of Economics and Management.	Ibrahim Okumu, omukugu mu by'enfuna mu yunivasite y'e Makerere, agamba nti, “Okukkiriza n'ebitongole ebirala okutereka ssente z'abakozi kirungi nnyo.”.
"“It’s likely to bring on board more competitive investors in our capital market."" Ibrahim Okumu added."	"Ibrahim Okumu yagattako nti, “Kijja kuleeta ba invesita abalala abanaaleetawo okuvuganya okusingako ."""
Uganda’s capital market, he adds, in certain ways, depends on the number of investors willing to hold long term liabilities.	Akatale k'eby'ensimbi mu Uganda okusingira ddala kasinziira ku muwendo gwa ba invesita abeetegefu okuteresebwa ssente okumala ebbanga ddene.
"“As is now, it is largely the National Social Security Fund that can hold long term liabilities and consequently invest long term liabilities."" he continued."	"Yeeyongera n'agamba nti, “Mu kiseera kino, ekitongole kya NSSF kye kyokka ekisobola okutereka ssente z'abantu okumala ebbanga ddene n'okuzissa mu bizineesi ezikola amagoba."""
"""This would not only avail more funds for investment but also would enhance Uganda’s growth process."" he added."	"Yagattako nti, ""Kino tekijja kukoma ku kwongera ku ssente ezisobola okuteekebwa mu bizineesi naye era kijja kwongera ku nkulaakulana ya Uganda."""
Okumu believes that National Social Security Fund’s service, evidenced by the low interest rates it has been paying towards workers' savings, is expected to vanish as competition sets in.	Okumu alowooza nti enkola ya NSSF ey'okuwa abakozi amagoba amatono ku ssente zaabwe, ejja kukyuka olw'okuvuganya okugenda okujjawo.
“The elimination of the National Social Security Fund monopoly by liberalising the pension sector signals enhanced competition among pension service providers in a bid to attract many,” he says.	Agamba nti, “Okuleetera NSSF okulekera awo okwefuga akatale kijja kuleetawo okuvuganya okw'amaanyi mu bitongole ebiteresi bya ssente z'abakozi ekijja okutumbula empeereza era kisikirize abakozi bangi okutereka ssente zaabwe mu bitongole ebyo.”
"“Therefore, we expect enhanced investment analysis before pension funds are invested and consequently better interest rates on workers savings"" Okumu continued."	"Okumu yeeyongera n'agamba nti, “Tusuubira nti kati wajja kubaawo okwegendereza nga ssente tezinnateekebwa mu kintu kyonna ekizza amagoba era nti abakozi bajja kufuna amagoba agasingako ku ssente zaabwe ze bateresezza."""
However, Kiwanuka Kunsa, a consultant in the pension investment, says liberalisation in the sector is a welcome point but there are still concerns about how it will be implemented.	Kyokka, Kiwanuka Kunsa, eyeebuuzibwako mu nsonga z'ebitongole ebiteresi bya ssente z'abakozi, agamba nti enkola eno empya eyaniriziddwa naye wakyaliwo ebyebuuzibwa ku ngeri gy'eneetambulamu .
At one time it represented a testament to Uganda’s reputation as one of the most refugee friendly countries in Africa.	Olumu kyali kitwalibwa ng'obukakafu obulabwako obulaga nti Uganda efaayo nnyo ku banoonyi b'obubudamo.
But recent events at Nakivale and Kyaka camps threaten to erode this reputation.	Naye kati ebyo ebyali mu nkambi y'e Nakivale n'ey'e Kyaka biyinza okuwa ekifaananyi ekirala ku Uganda.
On July 14, Ugandan police, working in tandem with Rwandan authorities, used false information to round up and forcibly deport approximately 2,000 Rwandan refugees.	Nga Jjulaayi 14, ekitongole kya poliisi mu Ugandan nga kikolera wamu n'ab'obuyinza mu Rwanda beekwasa ensonga ezitaali ntuufu ne bakwata Abanyarwanda abanoonyi b'obubudamo nga 2,000 era ne babazzaayo ku kifuba mu nsi yaabwe.
The operation, which was decried by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and human rights organizations, left two refugees dead and another 26 injured.	Ekikwekweto ekyo, ekyavumirirwa ennyo ekitongole ky'ensi yonna ekikola ku banoonyi b'obubudamu n'abalwanirizi b'eddembe ly'obuntu , byaleka abanoonyi b'obubudamo babiri nga bafudde ate abalala 26 ne bagendera ku bisago.
These refugees were attempting to leap off the trucks hauling them across the border to Rwanda.	Abanoonyi b'obubudamo abo baali bagezaako okubuuka ku loole eyali ebasaza ensalo okubazzaayo e Rwanda.
On Wednesday morning an unusually large Ugandan police contingent flanked by Rwandese officers surrounded the two camps.	Ku Lwokusatu kumakya, abasirikale ba poliisi bangi nga bali wamu n'abasirikale ba Rwanda beebungulula enkambi ezo ebbiri.
These Rwandese officers lured refugees to assembly points with false promises of food and information on appeals processes.	Abasirikale ba Rwanda abo baasendasenda abanoonyi b'obubudamo okukungaana nga babalimba nti bagenda kubawa mmere n'okubalambululira engeri gye bayinza okujuliramu.
Warning shots were fired when the refugees refused to cooperate with the police trying to load them onto Rwanda bound trucks.	Amasasi gaakubwa mu bbanga okulabula abanoonyi b'obubudamo abaali bagaanye okulinnya loole ezibazzaayo e Rwanda  nga poliisi bwe yali ebalagidde.
The 2,000 refugees are currently being held in transit centres on the Rwandan side of the border.	Abanoonyi b'obubudamu 2,000 kati bakuumirwa mu bifo ebitali bya nkalakkalira mu Rwanda.
The 26 injured remain in Uganda at health clinics around Nakivale.	Ate abo 26 abaafuna ebisago bakyali mu Uganda era bajjanjjabirwa mu bulwaliro obuli okumpi ne Nakivale.
Over the last three years, the Rwandan government has intensified efforts to have Rwandan refugees in neighbouring countries, including Uganda and Tanzania, repatriated.	Mu myaka esatu egiyise, gavumenti ya Rwanda eyongedde amaanyi mu kuggya abanoonyi b'obubudamo Abanyarwanda mu mawanga agali ku muliraano omuli Uganda ne Tanzania, bazzibweyo e Rwanda.
On October 3, 2007, the first major forced repatriation operation was launched when 3,000 Rwandan refugees were returned to their country of citizenship.	Ekikwekweto eky'amaanyi ekyasooka okukolebwa okuzzaayo ku mpaka abanoonyi b'obubudamu mu nsi yaabwe kyakolebwa nga Okitobba 3, 2007, abanoonyi b'obubudamo 3,000 Abanyarwanda bwe bazzibwayo mu nsi yaabwe.
The operation was carried out by police and armed personnel who stormed refugee huts at 2:00 am under the observation of United Nations refugee agency.	Ekikwekweto ekyo kyakolebwa poliisi n'abantu abalala abaalina eby'okulwanyisa abaazingako obusiisira bw'abanoonyi b'obubudamo ku ssaawa 8:00 ez'ekiro ng'ekitongole ky'ensi yonna ekikola ku nsonga z'abanoonyi b'obubudamu kiraba.
According to the Legal Officer at the Refugee Law Project, Salima Namusobya, such operations are a one off and they are coordinated between the governments of Rwanda and Uganda.	Okusinziira ku mukungu omu akola ku nsonga z'abanoonyi b'obubudamo, Salima Namusobya, yagamba nti ebikwekweto ng'ebyo tebitera kubaawo era nti bikolebwa gavumenti ya Rwanda ng'ekolagana wamu n'eya Uganda.
Over the years, United Nations High Commission for Refugees has held numerous meetings with Ugandan and Rwandan authorities on the repatriation of Rwandan refugees.	Emyaka bwe gizze gitambula, ekibiina ekikola ku nsonga z'abanoonyi b'obubudamu mu nsi yonna kibadde kifuna enkungaana n'ab'obuyinza mu Ugandan ne Rwanda ku nsonga z'okuzzaayo Abanyarwanda mu nsi yaabwe.
In Rwanda, the refugees are held at transit centres, but once they are released from these temporary holding areas, many of them will find their way back to Uganda.	Mu Rwanda, abanoonyi b'obubudamo bakuumirwa mu bifo ebimu okumala akaseera katono naye nga bwe bamala okuteebwa era banoonya engeri gye baddayo e Uganda.
"""Unwanted guests,"" the Rwandan refugees, are forced back across the border towards Kyangwali refugee camp near Hoima town."	Olw'okuba baba tebakyabaagala, abanoonyi b'obubudamo abo babazzaayo misinde nga bayitira ku nsalo eri okumpi n'enkambi y'e Kyangwali okumpi n'akabuga k'e Hoima.
In a courtesy Photo, featured in  The Independent on July 23 - 29, 2010, it was said that, upon return,the refugees are far less likely to make themselves known to the Ugandan government. 	Mu kifaananyi ekimu ekyafulumira mu lupapula lwa Independent olwa Jjulaayi 23 - 29, 2010, kyagambibwa nti abanoonyi b'obubudamu bwe bakomawo e Uganda tebeemanyisa eri ba buyinza mu Uganda.
They will also not make themselves known to United Nations High Commission for Refugees but will instead quietly disappear into the villages surrounding the camps in south western Uganda.   	Era tebeemanyisa eri kitongole ekikola ku nsonga z'abanoonyi b'obubudamu mu nsi yonna, mu kifo ky'ekyo babulira mu byalo ebiriranye enkabi ezo mu bugwanjuba bwa Uganda.
“Most of the refugees they took back in 2007 have come back,” says Nabusobya.	Nabusobya agamba nti, “Abasinga obungi ku banoonyi b'obubudamo abazzibbwayo mu 2007 baakomawo dda.”
"“Many Rwandans who are taken by force come back and register as Congolese refugees so this doesn’t help any of the countries involved"". Nabusobya added."	"Nabusobya agattako nti, “Bangi ku Banyarwanda abazzibwayo ku kifuba bakomawo ne beewandiisa ng'abanoonyi b'obubudamo Abakongo era ekyo kiba tekiyambye mawanga gombi gazingirwamu."""
"""Two months ago a bilateral agreement was struck between representatives of the Ugandan and Rwandese governments facilitating the deportation of Rwandese whose requests for asylum had been rejected."	"""Emyezi ebiri emabega, gavumenti ya Uganda ne Rwanda zaatuka ku nzikiriziganya ku ngeri y'okukwatamu Abanyarwanda abanoonyi b'obubudamu ababa bagaaniddwa okuddukira mu Uganda."
But Kai Nielsen, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees country representative for Uganda, had a concern. 	Naye Kai Nielsen, akiikirira ekitongole ky'ensi yonna ekikola ku nsonga z'abanoonyi b'obubudamu mu Uganda, yalina kye yeebuuza.
His concern was that among those deported on 14, July were people whose asylum claims had not yet been conclusively rejected.	Abamu ku abo abazzibwayo nga Jjulaayi 14, mwe mwali n'abo abaali batannagaanibwa ddala kufuna bubudamo mu Uganda.
Witness testimony from family members at the Ugandan refugee settlements indicate that a number of individuals had already been granted refugee status.	Obujulizi obwaweebwa ab'enganda z'abantu abo mu nkambi bulaga nti baali bakkiriziddwa okubeera mu ggwanga ng'abanoonyi b'obubudamo.
However those together with those still involved in the appeal process, were among those forced across the border.	Naye abantu abo awamu n'abo abaali baajulira be bamu ku abo abazzibwayo ku kifuba e Rwanda.
Nielsen further stated how unusual it was for Rwandan police to be present on Ugandan soil.	Nielsen era yagamba nti kyewuunyisa nnyo okuba nti poliisi ya Rwanda yajja okukolera emirimu gyayo mu Uganda.
The Kigali government has held the position for some time that there is no longer any need for Rwanda’s citizens to claim refugee status anywhere else in the world	Kati okumala ekiseera, gavumenti ya Rwanda ebaddenga egamba nti Abanyarwanda tekikyabeetaagisa kuddukira mu nsi ndala yonna nga banoonyi ba bubudamo.
Uganda, while still accepting asylum claims, has rejected 98 per cent of asylum applications from Rwandan citizens in the last year.	Wadde nga Uganda ekyakkiriza abanoonyi b'obubudamo okuyingira eggwanga, mu mwaka oguwedde yagaana Abanyarwanda ebitundu 98 ku buli kikumi okufuna obubudamo mu ggwanga.
Many Rwandan refugees came to Uganda fleeing the 1994 genocide, while others have fled Rwanda recently for political reasons.	Abanyarwanda bangi abanoonyi b'obubudamo baava mu Rwanda ne baddukira mu Uganda olw'ekittabantu ekyali mu Rwanda mu 1994, naye kati gye buvuddeko abantu badduka mu Rwanda lwa nsonga za bya bufuzi.
The Refugee Law Project has found that most Rwandan refugees are unwilling to go back because of fear of persecution through the Gacaca court system.	Ab'ekitongole kya Refugee Law Project bakizudde nti Abanyarwanda bangi batya okuddayo mu Rwanda olw'okutya okutulugunyizibwa.
“These refugees have gone back and have faced persecution, others have problems with property restitution,” said Namusobya.	Namusobya yagamba nti, “Abanoonyi b'obubudamu bano bwe baddayo, batulugunyizibwa, ate abalala tebabaddiza bintu byabwe.”
There are reports from those who return saying, people in government occupied their land and refugee agencies in Rwanda are not doing enough to integrate those that are taken back.	Abo abakomawo e Uganda bagamba nti abantu mu gavumenti bezza ettaka lyabwe era nti ebitongole by'abanoonyi b'obubudamo mu Rwanda tebikola kimala kubayamba.
Human Rights Watch has indicated that although the Rwandese government has made notable progress in reforming its judicial system since 2004, there is little assurance for free and fair trials.	Ekitongole ekirwanirira eddembe ly'obuntu kigamba nti wadde ng'ekitongole ekiramuzi mu Rwanda kirongoose okusinga bwe kyali mu 2004, tewannabaawo bukakafu bumala bulaga nti omuntu asobola okulamulwa mu mazima n'obwenkanya.
There have also been rights violation concerns in Rwanda, including increased insecurity and political repression in the period leading up to presidential elections on August 9.	Ate era wabaddewo okulinnyirira eddembe ly'obuntu mu Rwanda, omuli okutiisatiisa abantu n'okutulugunya bannabyabufuzi naddala mu biseera by'okulonda pulezidenti okwaliwo nga Agusito 9.
Nielsen questions Uganda’s cooperation in the forced repatriation.	Nielsen yeebuuza ensonga lwaki Uganda yakolagana ne Rwanda mu kuzzaayo abanoonyi b'obubudamu ku kifuba.
“I personally don’t see the reason for being so insistent on returning these people to Rwanda,” he said.	Yagamba nti, “Nze siraba nsonga lwaki bakaka abantu bano okuddayo mu Rwanda.”
"“I don’t think that they were a security threat or a financial burden to Uganda."" he went on to say."	"Era yagamba nti, “Sikiwa nti abantu bano baali ba bulabe eri gavumenti ya Uganda oba nti yali tesobola kubalabirira."""
The Minister for Disaster preparedness Tarsis Kabwegye denies that refugees are being forced home.	Minisita w'ebigwa bitalaze Tarsis Kabwegye yagaana okukkiriza nti abanoonyi b'obubudamo bawalirizibwa okuddayo mu nsi zaabwe.
"He claimed those taken back were asylum seekers and said that the Rwanda government has a right to come and pick up “their stranded citizens"""	"Yagamba nti abo abazzibwayo baali badduse lwa nsonga za byabufuzi era nti gavumenti ya Rwanda erina eddembe okujja n'etwala abantu baayo ""ababa basobeddwa nga tebamanyi kya kukola"""
But some of these refugees, according to Namusobya, should qualify for Ugandan citizenship.	Naye ye Namusobya agamba nti abamu ku banoonyi b'obubudamo abo baali bagwana n'okuweebwa obutuuze mu Uganda.
Many refugees have lived in the country for more than 20 years and the constitution accepts them and for most Rwandese they even have a local language knowledge addition.	Abanoonyi b'obubudamo bangi bamaze mu Uganda emyaka egisukka mu 20 era ssemateeka abakkiriza okufuna obutuuze, ate era Abanyarwanda abasinga obungi bayizeeyo waakiri olulimi lumu olwogerwa mu Uganda.
While the Uganda Refugees Act of 2006 recognizes that naturalisation applies to refugees, the immigration authorities in Uganda have continued to block refugees from acquiring citizenship.  	Wadde nga ssemateeka wa Uganda owa 2006 akkiriza abanoonyi b'obubudamu abamaze ebbanga eggere okufuna obutuuze, ekitongole kya Uganda ekikola ku nsonga z'abantu abayingira mu ggwanga kiremesa abanoonyi b'obubudamo okufuna obutuuze.
Namusobya said the Refugee Law Project intends to petition the constitutional court to allow refugees who have lived in Uganda for more than 20 years to be allowed citizenship.	Namusobya yagamba nti ekitongole kya Refugee Law Project kiteekateeka okuwaayo okusaba mu kkooti ekkirize abanoonyi b'obubudamo abamaze emyaka egisukka mu 20 mu Uganda okuweebwa obutuuze.
Most of these Rwandese have lost touch with their country of origin and so forcing them back ‘home’ cannot be the ultimate solution.	Abasinga obungi ku Bannyarwanda abo tebakyalina kakwate na nsi yaabwe era okubakaka okuddayo kiba tekibayamba n'akamu.
Refugees get off a truck at Matanda refugee camp in Kanungu district.	Abanoonyi b'obubuddamu bava ku loole mu nkambi y'e Matanda mu disitulikiti y'e Kanungu.
Many refugees forced back to Rwanda return to Uganda claiming they are Congolese.	Abanoonyi b'obubuddamu bangi abazzibwayo e Rwanda ku mpaka bakomawo mu Uganda nga bagamba nti Bakongo.
In a courtesy  photo in October 2007, Uganda deported 3,000 Rwandans on a Wednesday night when the authorities raided Kyaka II and Nakivale refugee settlements. 	Ekifaananyi ekyakubibwa mu Okitobba 2007, Uganda yazzaayo Abanyarwanda 3,000 e Rwanda mu kiro ky'Olwokusatu ab'obuyinza bwe baazingako enkambi y'e Kyaka II n'ey'e Nakivale.
On that night, thousands of Rwandan nationals were violently driven out of those settlements.	Mu kiro ekyo, Abanyarwanda nkumi na nkumi baagobebwa mu nkambi ezo mu ngeri ey'obukambwe.
A witness told reporters that the refugees were loaded onto four Fuso trucks and forcibly expelled late at night.	Eyeerabirako n'agage yagamba bannamawulire nti abanoonyi b'obubuddamu baateekebwa ku Fuso nnya ne bakakibwa okugenda amatumbi budde.
There were protests against the violation of the United Nations principle of non refoulemnt or involuntary return of people to a country they fled.	Abantu beekalakaasa nga bawakanya eky'okumenya etteeka ery'Amawanga Amagatte erigaana okukkakka abantu okuddayo mu ggwanga lye baddukamu.
At the time United Nations High Commission for Refugees agreed with the governments of Rwanda and Uganda claims that return had been 'voluntary'.	Mu kiseera ekyo, ekitongole ky'ensi yonna ekikola ku nsonga z'abanoonyi b'obubudamo kyakkiriza ebyo gavumenti ya Rwanda ne Uganda ze byakigamba nti abantu abo baddayo 'kyeyagalire'.
There were reported cases of refugees who tried to commit suicide by taking a cattle dip acaricide in trying to resist the repatriation.	Kigambibwa nti waaliwo n'abanoonyi b'obubuddamu abamu abaagezaako n'okwetta nga bakozesa eddagala ly'ente nga baagala okwewala okuzzibwayo e Rwanda.
Refugees, some older than 50 years, had been forced to return to Rwanda. 	Abanoonyi b'obubuddamu, ng'abamu baali basussa mu myaka 50 egy'obukulu, baakakibwa okuddayo mu Rwanda.
Newspaper reports at the time revealed that the affected communities were mainly Rwandese of Hutu origin who had first sought refugee status in Tanzania but were expelled in 2003.	Empapula z'amawulire zaagamba nti ebitundu ebyasinga okukosebwa ennyo by'ebyo ebyalimu Abanyarwanda Abahutu abangi abaasooka okubudamirako e Tanzania naye ne bagobwayo mu 2003.
Most Rwandan refugees moved into Uganda after Tanzania began to aggressively return them to Rwanda.	Abanoonyi b'obubuddamu Abanyarwanda abasinga obungi bajja mu Uganda oluvannyuma lwa Tanzania okutandika okubazzaayo e Rwanda n'eryanyi.
Over 5,000 refugees moved to Uganda in 2003.	Abanoonyi b'obubuddamu abasukka mu 5,000 bajja mu Uganda mu 2003.
The Independent on July 23 - 29, 2010, in a declassified intelligence file by Rowan Emslie had information that on the night of the attack, everyone was in shock.  	Olupapula lwa Independent olwa July 23 - 29, 2010, fayiro eyakolebwa Rowan Emslie yalaga nti mu kiro obulumbaganyi obwo lwe bwakolebwa, buli omu yasigala mu ntiisa.
I talked to a young couple who had been watching the World Cup Final at The Lion’s Den, a bar immediately opposite Ethiopian Village Restaurant.           	Nnayogerako n'omwami n'omukyala omu abaali balabira omupiira ku bbaala eyitibwa The Lion’s Den, eriraanye Ethiopian Village Restaurant.
As Kampala slowly moves back towards normalcy, the mood around the city is changing. 	Nga Kampala agenda adda mpolampola mu nteeko, enneewulira z'abantu mu kibuga nazo zigenda zikyuka.
People are starting to express anger, at either Al Shabaab or the police for not having done enough in preparation, as well as fear. 	Abantu banyiivu olwa Al Shabaab okukola ekintu eky'ettima bwe kityo era banyiivu olwa poliisi obutakola kimala kwetegekera bulumbaganyi obwo, era bali mu kutya.
In a report by international relations expert John Mueller, he noted that, reactions to terrorism have often led to massive unjustified persecution, some of which is considerable historic consequence.	Mu alipoota gye yakola, omwekenneenya omu ayitibwa John Mueller yagamba nti bwe wabaawo obulumbaganyi bw'abatujju, emirundi egisinga amawanga gakwata era ne gatulugunya abantu abatalina musango, oboolyawo nga basinziira ku byafaayo bye babalinako.
The Russian re-engagement with Chechnya in 1999 or Israel’s crackdowns against Palestine are instant examples.	Ebyo ebikwata ku Russia ne Chechnya mu 1999 oba ebyaliwo nga Isirairi enoonya Abapalesitiina bikiraga bulungi.
President Museveni’s pledge to send additional 20,000 troops to the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia was based on reactionary anger and a show of strength.	Pulezidenti Museveni okusuubiza okusindika abasirikale abalala 20,000 mu Somalia yakyogeza busungu na lwa kwagala kulaga lyanyi.
This followed the comments of an Al Shabaab leader who said that the bombings were revenge for Uganda’s deployment of peacekeepers in Mogadishu and was ‘only the beginning’.	Ebyo yabyogera oluvannyuma lw'omu ku bakulembera Al Shabaab okugamba nti obulumbaganyi obwo baabukola kwesasuza Uganda olw'okusindika amagye e Somaliya era nti eyo ntandikwa butandikwa.
Mueller is a renowned sceptic of how important terrorists are and has often argued that the relatively low death tolls cannot justify the massive killings seen in a retaliatory war.	Mueller amanyiddwa nnyo mu kunoonyereza ku nsonga za bannalukalala era agamba nti talaba nsonga lwaki okufa kw'abantu abatonotono kuviirako abantu okutta abantu bangi nnyo nga bagezaako okwesasuza.
"Although some people like to proclaim that this is ‘the age of terror,’ Mueller in ‘Reactions and Overreactions to Terrorism,’ says, “deaths from international terrorism are only a few, annually"" "	"Mu kitabo 'Reactions and Overreactions to Terrorism,’ Mueller agamba nti “wadde ng'abatujju batta abantu, omuwendo gw'abantu be batta buli mwaka mu nsi yonna okutwalira awamu mutono."""
Two American researchers, Jennifer Merolla and Elizabeth Zechmeister, spent five years researching the reactions of the general public to terrorist threats to see how people change their opinions.	Abanoonyereza babiri okuva mu Amerika, Jennifer Merolla ne Elizabeth Zechmeister, baamala emyaka etaano nga banoonyereza ku ngeri abantu okutwalira awamu gye batwalamu obulumbaganyi bwa bannalukalala era n'engeri abantu gye bakyusaamu endowooza yaabwe.
Reports of xenophobic violence since the bombings have been disturbing, especially considering Uganda has a reputation for being an accessible and safe country.	Ebikolwa eby'obukambwe ebikolebwa ku bantu b'eggwanga abatujju mwe baava byeraliikiriza, nnaddala bw'olowooza ku ky'okuba nti Uganda ebadde emanyiddwa ng'ensi omuntu mw'asobola okufunira emirembe.
What is perhaps more worrying is the lack of furore after the Ugandan Parliament approved the controversial Phone Tapping Bill last week.	Ate n'ekirala ekisinga okweraliikiriza kiri nti abantu tebaasanyukira tteeka paliyamenti lye yabaga wiiki ewedde erikwata ku kulumika amasimu.
Karin Bridger, a videographer and cultural anthropologist working in Uganda said, some people have embraced a ‘keep calm and carry on’ attitude, while others have become more crippled by concern.	Karin Bridger, omukwasi wa vidiyo akolera mu Uganda agamba nti abantu abamu bo basazeewo okuba n'endowooza egamba nti ‘sigala ng'oli mukkakkamu weeyongereyo n'obulamu' ate abalala bo okutya kubassannyalazza.
Those who went to work on Monday morning relatively unconcerned, caused consternation with people who were more scared.          	Abo abaagenda okukola ku Bbalaza nga  balinga abatafuddeeyo nnyo baasobera abantu abaali bakubiddwa entiisa olw'ekyo ekyali kibaddewo.
A lawyer, who asked not to be named said he went to work on the next Monday morning after the attack. 	Munnamateeka omu ataayagala kwatuukirizibwa mannya yagamba nti oluvannyuma lw'obulumbaganyi obwo, ye yagenda ku mulimu ku Bbalaza.
"""Don’t worry too much"", says one of those people who were less openly affected by the attacks."	"Omu ku bantu ataalemesa bulumbaganyi obwo kumusannyalaza yagamba nti, ""Tekyetaagisa kweraliikirira kisukkiridde."""
There are also stories of an outpouring of anger and fear brought on by relatively minor things, maybe two or three days later.      	Era kigambibwa nti wabaawo obusungu n'okutya ebireetebwa ebintu ebitonotono ebiyinza okubaawo ennaku nga bbiri oba ssatu oluvannyuma.
A doctor who was called to Mulago,on the night of the blasts, working in frantic conditions at very short notice had this to say.	Omusawo eyayitibwa okugenda e Mulago mu kiro ekyo nga bbomu zaakakuba abantu era eyakolera mu mbeera eyo ey'entiisa yagamba bw'ati.
Coping with 7/11 aftermath, Mueller, a renowned sceptic of how important terrorists are, argues that the low death tolls cannot justify the massive loss of life seen in a retaliatory war.	Ng'ayogera ku ngeri y'okwaŋŋanga embeera oluvannyuma lw'obulumbaganyi obwaliwo nga Jjulaayi 11, Mueller, agamba nti talaba nsonga lwaki okufa kw'abantu abatonotono kuviirako abantu okutta abantu bangi nnyo nga bagezaako okwesasuza.
In an introduction of an unreferenced memorandum dated 13, October 2008.	Mu nnyanjula y'ekiwandiiko ekyawandiikibwa nga 13, Okitobba 2008.
On the 08, October 2008, a meeting comprising of 24 former Allied Democratic Forces reporters led by their former Chief of Staff, Benz Tushabe Munyangondo, was convened.	Nga 08, Okitobba 2008, olukuŋŋaana olwalimu abaaliko abayeekera ba ADF 24 nga bakulembeddwamu eyaliko mukama waabwe, Benz Tushabe Munyangondo, lwatuula.
The meeting was also important as a pre-emptive security measure owing to their grievances ahead of the 09, October 2008 Independence Day celebrations.	Olukuŋŋaana olwo era lwategekebwa okwongera okunyweza eby'okwerinda nga batunula mu kwemulugunya kwe baalina, naddala nga bwe kiri nti emikolo gy'amefuga gyali gisembedde nga gya kubaawo nga 09, Okitobba 2008.
It was also about the just concluded Tripartite Plus,the Common Market for East and Southern Africa and the Southern Development Community Heads of government summit in Kampala.	Era lwali lukwata ne ku lukuŋŋaana olwalimu abakulembezee b'amawanga ag'enjawulo olwali lwakaggwa olwali mu Kampala.
The memorandum was signed by Hussein Maiga and Benz Tushabe on behalf of the group.	Ekiwandiiko ekyo kyassibwako omukono Hussein Maiga ne Benz Tushabe ku lwabannaabwe.
That they represent and work on behalf of the many Allied Democratic Forces reporters scattered all over the country having been pardoned under the Amnesty Act of 2000.	Nti bakiikirira era bakolerera bannaabwe abangi abaaliko abayeekera ba ADF abasaasaanidde mu bitundu by'eggwanga ebitali bimu oluvannyuma lw'okuweebwa ekisonyiwo okusinziira ku ssemateeka wa 2000 akwata ku kuwa abantu ekisonyiwo.
That it’s over 7 years since the former Allied Democratic Forces combatants voluntarily renounced rebellion against the government by reporting to various stakeholders.	Nti kati wayise emyaka egisukka mu 7 bukya abaaliko abayeekera ba ADF okuva mu buyeekera ne beewaayo mu mikono gya gavumenti n'ebitongole ebirala nga bakakasa nti baleseeyo ebikolwa eby'obuyeekera.
These stakeholders included; army units/ detaches, Resident District Commissioner offices, churches and many others.	Mu kwewaayo baatuukirira ebitongole by'amagye, ofiisi za ba RDC, abakulu b'amadiini, n'abalala.
That it would be a wrong assumption for the government to think they surrendered because of cowardice or the Uganda People's Defence Forces fire power.	Nti kiba kikyamu gavumenti okulowooza nti beewaayo olw'okuba baali batiitiizi oba olw'okuba eggye lya UPDF lyali lya maanyi.
That they have written numerous reports and memorandum highlighting their plight to His Excellence, The President and The Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence.	Nti bawandiise alipoota nnyingi era n'ebiwandiiko ebitali bimu ebirambika embeera gye balimu ne babiwa Ow'ekitiibwa Pulezidenti ne CMI.
That the resettlement package given to former Allied Democratic Forces was too small.	Nti ssente ezaaweebwa abo abaaliko abayeekera ba ADF zaali ntono nnyo.

After an agonising 33 hours, Patrick and Beatrice Kirumira Lubowa were relieved to receive the good news that their four year old son King Lubowa, had been recovered safe. 	Oluvannyuma lw'okumala essaawa 33 nga beeraliikirivu nnyo, Patrick ne Beatrice Kirumira Lubowa emitima gyabakka bwe baafuna amawulire amalungi nti mutabani waabwe ow'emyaka ena, Kinga Lubowa, yali azuuliddwa nga mulamu.
King Lubowa had been kidnapped by Uganda’s Al-Shabaab.	King Lubowa yali awambiddwa aba Al-Shabaab abali mu Uganda.
Beatrice Kirumira Luboowa is the daughter of Kampala businessman Godfrey Kirumira.	Beatrice Kirumira Luboowa muwala w'omusuubuzi w'omu Kampala ayitibwa Godfrey Kirumira.
King was kidnapped from his parents’ home in Kiwafu-Makindye, a Kampala suburb, on July 24 by a housemaid, Soso Solange.	King yawambibwa omukozi w'awaka ayitibwa Soso Solange okuva mu maka g'abazadde be agasangibwa mu Kiwafu e Makindye, mu Kampala, nga Jjulaayi 24.
Swift action by the Uganda police and other security organs traced the kidnappers to a single room house in Makindye.	Poliisi ya Uganda n'ebitongole ebirala ebikuuma ddembe byasitukiramu ne birondoola abo abaamuwamba ne bibasanga mu kayumba ak'omuzigo ogumu e Makindye.

"In The Independent on  July 30 - August 05 2010, in a news round-up, Yusuf Serunkuma said, the most renowned lines defining terror is that it is a “clash of civilizations""."	"Mu mawulire ga Independenti aga Jjulaayi nga 13 okutuuka nga Agusto 5, Yusuf Serunkuma yagamba nti ""ebigambo okukontana kw'obugunjufu"" bye bikyasinze okunnyonnyola ekigambo okutya."
”It was started by Princeton University professor Bernard Lewis in his 1990 article, The Roots of Muslim Rage.	Kino kyatandikibwawo omukenkufu ayitibwa Bernard Lewis ow'omu Princeton Universty mu ebyo bye yawandiika mu 1990, Ensibuko y'Obukambwe bw'Abasiraamu.

After the July 11 bomb attacks in Kampala, I have come to fully understand that war is serious business, and more serious when it reaches your house.	Oluvannyuma lwa bbomu ezaatulikira mu Kampala ngaJjulaayi 11, kati nkitegeera bulungi nti olutalo si kintu kya muzannyo era luba lwa kabi nnyo nnaddala nga lutuuse ewuwo.
If the July 11 had happened in Mogadishu, it would have passed as a small inconvenience and also maybe as a lead story on Aljazeera Television.	Singa kino ekyaliwo mu Jjulaayi nga 11 kyali Mogadishu, tekyandiwuniikiriza nnyo era tekyandyogeddwako ng'ekintu ekikulu mu mawulire ga Aljazeera,
Kampala would be normal business mindless of our large military presence in this coastal country.	Kampala yandibadde kifo kirungi nnyo eky'okukoleramu busineesi singa abasirikale baba tebakyefuze.
As it has always been, we would have absent-mindedly asked them when these people will stop fighting. 	Nga bwe kibadde bulijjo, twandibadde tumala gababuuza ddi abantu bano lwe banaalera awo okulwanagana.
This question is an assumption that fighting groups in Somalia are unintelligent brutes fighting and killing each other without reason.	Mu kubuuza ekibuuzo kino tuba tusuubira nti abo abalwanagana mu Somalia tebalina magezi kubanga balwanagana era ne battiŋŋaana awatali nsonga.
It also assumes that increased military intervention in form of peacekeeping missions can help save Somalis from finishing off each other.	Era kitebeerezebwa nti amaggye amagwiira ageeyongera okutwalibwa mu Somaliya okukuuma emirembe gajja kusobola okuyamba Abasomaali obutesanyaawo.
This also assumes that foreign nations can help export liberty and other freedoms to Somalia, even if they seem uninterested in them.	Era kitebeerezebwa nti amagye amagwiira gajja kusobola okuleeta emirembe mu Somaliya, wadde nga bo balabika ng'abatafaako.
Analyses of the Kampala bombings have become so emotional, as it were in post 9/11 America.	Kinakuwaza nnyo nga bwe kyali oluvannyuma lwa ebyo ebyali mu Amerika nga 9/11 bwe twongera okwekennenya ebyo ebyaliwo bbomu lwe zaatulikira mu Kampala.
Hijab covered Muslim girls, and men with long beards or those wearing turbans are now the unfortunate recipients of public rage as the “bad guys”.	Abawala Abasiraamu abeebikirira n'abasajja ab'ebirevu ebiwanvu oba abo abambala ebiremba be boolekezeddwa obwanga nga batwalibwa okuba abantu ababi.
In a discussion with a colleague, I asked him what took America to Somalia against the Union of Islamic Courts that tried to give Somalia a resemblance of a government. 	Bwe nnali nnyumyako ne mukozi munnange nnamubuuza ekyatwala Abamerika mu Somaliya okulwanyisa ekibiina ky'abasiraamu abali bagezaako okussaawo ekyefaananyiriza okuba gavumenti.
The union was trying this out after 14 years of civil war.	Ekibiina ekyo kyali kigezaako okukola kino oluvannyuma lw'emyaka 14 egy'olutalo olw'omunda.
His argument was that the Islamic Courts Union had put in place an administration that cherishes stoning the adulterous, amputating thieves and compulsory wearing of full body garments. 	Ye yagamba nti ekibiina ky'abasiraamu ekyo kyali kitaddewo enkola ey'okukuba abenzi amayija, okutemako ababbi amagulu n'okuwaliriza abantu okwambala engoye ezibikka omubiri gwonna.
Bernard Lewis called this “a clash of civilisation”.	"Kino Bernard Lewis yakiyita ""okukontana kw'obugunjufu."""
As Professor Mahmood Mamdani has argued, modern violence is considered the inevitable hallmark of progress.	Omukenkufu Mahmood Mamdana agamba nti, obukambwe obuliwo ensanji zino buteekwa buteekwa kubaawo kubanga ke kabonero akalaga enkulaakulana
Israel’s shelling of the Gazans in late 2008 was considered crucial for Israel security, and so is the war in Afghanistan and in Iraq for American safety.	Ekya Abayisirayiri okuwandagaza bbomu ku bantu b'omu Gaza mu 2008, kyatwalibwa okuba ekintu ekikulu ennyo mu by'okwerinda kwa Isirairi, era mu ngeri y'emu olutalo lwa Afiganistani ne Iraka lutwalibwa ng'ekintu ekikulu ennyo mu by'okwerinda kwa Amerika.
After the Septemebr 11th incident, frightened Americans considered any Muslim led country, an enemy to progress.	Oluvannyuma lw'ebyo ebyaliwo nga Ssebutemba 11, Abamerika baatandika okutwaala ensi yonna ekulemberwa Abasiraamu okuba ey'obulabe eri enkulaakulana.
It piled all Muslims behind Osama bin Laden, which Americans had managed to subdue all along.	Kino kyateeka Abasiraamu bonna emabega wa Osama bi Laden, ate nga Amerika yali ekirinye ku nfeete.
In America’s new frontlines, Aljazeera journalists Rageh Omar and Muhammad Adow who were born in Somalia note how the Union of Islamic Courts had brought peace to that country.	Ekibiina ky'Abasiraamu kyali kisodde okuleeta emirembe mu nsi eyo.
Warlords in the North, who surely thrived under chaos, were shocked by the rapid spread of peace and popularity of the courts.	Abalwanyi abali mu mambuka ababaddewo mu bugubi baawuniikirira bwe baalaba engeri emirembe n'obuganzi bwe byaddawo amangu.
They were not alone though, they had another equally distraught friend  and that was America.	Weewawo si beeboka, waliwo ne bannabwe abalala abaawuniikirira era bano nga be Abamerika.
Fear: Was the headline on September 11th as the rest of the world; “saw a country struck by amnesia”.	"Okutya: Gwe ggwali omutwe omukulu mu mawulire ga Ssebutemba 11 ng'abantu bonna mu nsi ""balaba ensi eri mu kusoberwa."""
Misled by the hypothesis of “clash of civilisations”, America was fearful of another stable Muslim led regime, which they thought would provide haven for jihadists.	Olw'okuwubisibwa embeera eyaliwo ekontana n'obugunjufu, Amerika yalina okutya eri gavumenti yonna ekulemberwa Abasiraamu nga balowooza nti yanditumbudde obwannalukalala.
In usual American fashion, the United States sought to bring the union of Islamic Courts down.	Amerika yali eyagala okusanyalaza ekibiina ky'abasiraamu okuyitira mu nkola yaabwe eya bulijjo ey'Ekimerika.
Using the Central Intelligence Agency, it secretly shuttled cash and ammunitions to warlord controlled parts of Mogadishu.	Nga bakozesa abakkesi baabwe, mu ngeri enneekusifu baawereza ssente n'eby'okulwanyisa eri abalwanyi abaali beefuze ebitundu ebitali bimu mu Mogadishu.
Faced with defeat in this move, with pro Courts Somalis staging a well choreographed and spirited defence, America sought conspiracy with Somalia’s arch enemy, Ethiopia.	Bwe baalemesebwa Abasomaali okukola kino, olwo Amerika n'etandika okukolagana ne Esopiya abaali abalabe ba Abasomaali abasingirayo ddala.
Somalia was sent to the dogs.	Abasomaliya ne basindikibwa eri embwa

And as Franz Fanon has written “man is no to scorn of man, a no to the degradation of man, a no to the exploitation of man.	"Era nga Franz Fanon bwe yawandiika ""omuntu tanyomeka, omuntu tayisibwamu maaso, omuntu tabbika."
"”And in the defeat of the Islamic Courts militia in 2005, an angry wing was born, the Al-Shabaab"". Franz continues to write."	"Akabinja k'Abasiramu abalwanyi bwe kaawangulibwa mu 2005, akalala ak'omutawaana akayitibwa Al-Shabaab ne katandikibwawo"". Bw'atyo Franz bwe yeeyogera okuwandiika"
It emerged fighting Ethiopia, America and all its allies.	Kaatandika okulwanyisa Esopia, Abamerika awamu n'eb'emikago bonna.
It is at this point that Uganda sends troops to Somalia on a peacekeeping mission.	Mu kiseera kino Uganda w'esindikira amaggye mu Somaliya okukuuma emirembe.
Viewed through the lens of a conspirator, Uganda has imported terror in an attempt to export peace.	Olw'okuba baatwalibwa okuba abaseketerezi, mu kugezaako okutwalayo emirembe yo Uganda effunyeemu bukyayi.
But the most unfortunate part of this bargain for America, and specifically for helpless Uganda is that the attack was on a Muslim country.	Naye ekibi ennyo ekivudde mu kuyamba Amereka, kwe kuba nti Uganda yalumba ensi y'Abasiraamu.
But as G.W Hegel has written in respect to the 1789 French revolution, men are able to die for a cause of greater value than life itself.	Naye nga G.W Hegel bwe yawandiika ku bikwata ku nkyukakyuka eyaliwo mu Bufalaansa mu 1789, abantu basobola okufiiririra ekintu kyonna eky'omuwendo okusinga obulamu.
At that rate, Hegel added that they were ready to kill for the same cause.	Bw'atyo Hegel yagattako nti baali beetegefu okutta.
But with a misguided cultural talk, Ugandans have the potential to drag their Muslim compatriots into supporting Al-Shabaab.	Naye olw'obutamanya, Bannayuganda basobola okukubiriza Basiraamu bannaabwe okuwagira aba Al-Shabaab.
Culture talk, Al-Shabaab and political Islam Hijab covered Muslim girls, and men with long beards or those wearing turbans are the unfortunate ones.	Enjogera eyeekuusa ku buwangwa, Al-Shabaab n'ekibiina ky'eby'obufuzi eky'abawala Abasiraamu abeebikirira n'abasajja abalina ebirevu ebiwanvu era abambala ebiremba be bali mu katyabaga
Mwenda read with particular keenness President Yoweri Museveni’s article on July 25, where he defended Ugandan troop presence in Somalia.	Nga Jjulaayi 25, Mwenda yasoma n'obwegendereza ebyo Puleezidenti Museveni bye yawandiika ng'awagira eky'amagye okugenda mu Somaliya.
I use the words “particular keenness” because I highly respect Museveni’s analysis of security issues.	"Nkozesa ebigambo ""obwegendereza"" kubanga nzissa nnyo ekitiibwa ku ngeri Museveni gy'annyonnyolamu ensonga z'okwerinda."
While his article is strong and persuasive, I was not convinced about intervention in Somalia.	Wadde nga bye yawandiika bikulu era nga bisikiriza, ssali mumativu ku nsonga y'amaggye okugenda mu Somaliya.
First, the president makes clear that he has not made research on Somalia even though it is in relation to the collapse of Siad Barre.	Okusookera ddala, pulezidenti akiraga bulungi nti takolanga kunoonyereza ku Somaliya wadde nga kino kyekuusa ku kugwa kwa Siad Barre.
President Museveni should have learnt this from his reading of the United States experience in Vietnam.	Pulezidenti Museveni kino yandibadde akiyigira ku ebyo by'asoma ebyatuuka ku Amerika mu Vietnam.
These lessons constitute the Collin Powell Doctrine that was successful in the Gulf War one.	Eby'okuyiga bino bizingiramu endowooza ya Collin Powell eyali ennuŋŋaamu ku bikwata ku lutalo olw'omu Gulf olwasooka.
George Bush Jr ignored those lessons at great peril.	George Bush Jr yabuusa amaaso eby'okuyiga ebyo era ebyavaamu tebyali birungi.
The president did not respond to critical issues like the objectives, key success indicators, timeframe of our intervention and our exit strategy in Somalia.	Pulezidenti teyalowooza ku nsonga enkulu gamba nga ebigendererwa, obubonero obulaga obuwanguzi, ebbanga lye twandimmazeeyo awamu ng'engeri gye twandivuddeyo.
President Museveni should be a student of his own history and that of Uganda before he labels all insurgents in Somalia names.	Pulezidenti Museveni asaanidde ayigire ku ebyo bye yayitamu awamu n'ebyo Uganda by'eyiseemu nga tannayogera ku bamawale bonna mu Somaliya.
Just imagine if, in 1986, the international community had branded him a communist and the United States decided to use African troops to prop the Okello-Okello regime.	Kiteeberezeemu, singa mu 1986 ensi zonna zaasalawo okumuyita omukonomisiti ne Amerika n'esalawo okukozesa amaggye ga Afirika okuyamba gavumenti ya Okello.
In other words, The Organisation of African Unity forces would have come to Uganda to block a more meaningful resolution of the crisis of the state in our country.	Mu ngeri endala, eggye ly'ekibiina ekigatta amawanga ga Afirika lyandibadde lijja ne liziyizza abo abali bafuba okuleetawo enkyukakyuka ennungi mu nsi yaffe.
That is what Uganda is doing in Somalia.	Ekyo kyennyini Uganda ky'ekola mu Somaliya.
Sadly, the president presents the emergence of the Islamic Courts Union  in American language as a group that sought to create an “Islamic fundamentalist state” governed by Sharia law.	"musseewo ""enfuga y'ekisiraamu"" egoberera amateeka ga Sharia."
What is wrong with this? Saudi Arabia is an Islamic fundamentalist state governed by Sharia law but Uganda has diplomatic relations with it.	Kikyamu ki ekiri mu kino? Saud Arebia ggwanga erifugibwa ku mateeka ga Sharia era Uganda erina enkolagana ennungi n'ensi eyo.
What is so abhorrent in Somalia’s Islamic fundamentalist orientation and use of Sharia law that is intolerable to America and Uganda?	Kikyamu ki ennyo ekiri mu nfuga eno mu Somaliya ne kiba nti tekiyinza kugumiikirizikika Uganda ne Amerika?
Besides, the primary objective in Somalia should be to get a group that can exercise effective military control over the country before we begin to talk of its religious.	Ng'oggyeko ekyo, ensonga eyandibadde esinga obukulu mu Somaliya yandibadde okufuna abantu abandikoze amaggye agandikuumye obulungi ensi eyo nga tetunnatandika kwogera ku bya ddiini.
I am inclined to believe that President Museveni is either misled or is posturing to Washington DC or both to take his current position.	Mu kusalawo okukola kino, nze ndowooza nti Pulezident Museveni ayinza okuba ng'awubiddwa obanga amala gagoberera Amerika by'ekola.
There is no way a coterie of corrupt and opportunistic civilians without basic military know-how can establish security in Somalia even if propped by Uganda and the African Union.	Tewaliwo ngeri yonna ekibinja ky'abantu ababi era bannakigwanyizi abatalina bumanyirivu mu bya kijjaasi gye bayinza okuleetawo emirembe mu Somaliya wadde nga bawagirwa Uganda n'ekibiina ekigatta amawanga g'Afirika.
President Museveni, more than any other African I know understands well how foreign interventions, however well intentioned, are incapable of establishing a stable peace, leave alone a functional state.	Obutafaananako muntu yenna mu Afirika gwe mmanyi, pulezidenti Museven amanyi bulungi nnyo nti amawanga amaggwiira ka gabe nga galina ekigendererwa ekirungi tegayinza kuleetawo butebenkevu bwa lubeerera.
President Museveni writes about the Tanzanian invasion of Uganda to liberate us from Idi Amin’s murderous tyranny as, a very good thing.	Pulezidenti Museveni mu bye yawandiika ayogera bulungi ku ngeri Tanzaniya gye yalumbamu Uganda n'ekigendererwa eky'okutununula mu ttemu n'obwakyemalira bwa Idi Amini.
However, the removal of Amin did not create stability but state collapse in spite of the presence of the Tanzanian People’s Defence Forces troops on our soil.	Waddde kiri kityo, okuggyibwawo kw'obufuzi bwa Amini tekyaleetawo butebenkevu wadde nga n'Abatanzaniya bali bakyaliwo mu nsi yaffe.
Ugandan exiles had misadvised President Julius Nyerere that resolving the post Amin situation required a democracy built on a consensus and coalition of different political groups.	Bannayuganda abaali mu buwaŋŋanguse baawa Julius Nyerere amagezi amakyamu nti okusobola okugonjoola ekizibu ekyali kizzeewo nga Amini avuddewo, kyali kyetaagisa demokulasiya okumuzimbira ku kukaanya n'okukolaganira awamu n'ebibiina by'obufuzi ebitali bimu.
Museveni made a counter proposal to Nyereresaying that the emerging coalition should be based on military organisation and capability, not on opportunistic politics.	Museveni yawa Nyerere ekirowoozo ekyali kyawukana ku ekyo ng'agamba nti okwegatta okwo kwandibadde kwesigamizibwa ku nteekateeka y'ekijjaasi n'obusobozi so ku bannabyabufuzi bannakigwanyizi.
He was ironically supported by Milton Obote.	Ekirowoozo kye kyawagirwa nnyo Milton Obote.
Their disagreement was on the composition of the military coalition that Museveni wanted one based on 50:50 between his group and Obote’s.	Tebakkiriziganya ku ngeri eggye gye lyali lirina kubeeramu kubanga ye Museveni yali ayagala ye ne Obote buli omu abeere n'ebitundu ataano ku buli kikumi.
Meanwhile the Uganda People's Congress leader wanted an 80:20 in his favour.	Songa ate ye omukulembeze wa Uganda People's Congress yali ayagala abeere n'ebitundu kinaana ate ye munne abeere n'ebitundu abiri.
In the maneuverings that took place in Tanzania, Museveni and Obote lost.	Okusinzira ku ebyo ebyali e Tanzaniya, bombi Museveni ne Obote baafiirwa.
That is how Yusuf Lule and the The Uganda National Liberation Front, completely lacking in military knowledge, came to power.	Eyo ye nsonga lwaki Yusuufu Lule n'eggye lya Uganda ennunuzi, abaatalina bumanyirivu bwonna mu by'ekijjaasi, be bajja mu buyinza.
Uganda instead became extremely unstable as the state lost the ability to ensure personal security.	Ekyo kyatabangula nnyo Uganda kubanga ensi teyalina busobozi okukakasa nti wabaawo emirembe mu nsi.
It was not until the Tanzanians withdrew when Obote and Museveni faced each other militarily in Luwero.	Abatanzaniya nga bagenze, Museveni ne Obote baayolesaganya obwanga mu lutulo e Luwero.
It is ironic that among African leaders, Museveni is trying to impose a solution on Somalia when he was victim to Nyerere’s well intentioned but failed effort to stabilise Uganda.	Kyewunyisa okulaba nti mu bakulembeze ba Afirika bonna Museven y'agezaako okukakkatika endowooza ye ku Somaliya ate nga ye kennyini yayisibwa bubi nnyo olw'ekirowoozo kya Nyerere eky'okuleetawo emirembe mu Uganda wadde nga kyamala ne kiggwa butaka.
Isn’t it also ironic that it is President Museveni of all people who is labeling Somalis fighting for their country as mere stooges of the Middle East?	Era tekyewuunyisa nti mu bonna pulezidenti Museveni y'avvumirira Abasomaali abalwanirira ensi yaabwe ng'abayita bakazanyirizi b'omu kyondo ky'Ebuwarabu.
This was especially because he had been labeled a communist and a Marxist by the very people who do not see initiative in the struggles taking place in Somalia?	Kiri kityo kubanga abantu be bamu abaamutwala okuba n'endowooza y'ekikomunisti era be babuusa amaaso okufuba kw'abo abaagala okununula Somaliya.
The Islamic Courts Union had made clear its desire to cooperate with the United States using its spokesman in Nairobi.	Ekibiina ky'Abasiraamu kya kyoleka bulungi nti kyali kyagala okukolaganira awamu ne Amerika okuyitira mu mwogezi waabwe e Nairobi.
Had it been allowed it to consolidate, the United States could have leveraged technical and financial aid to moderate the extremist aspects of the government.	Singa baakkiriza okukolaganira awamu, Amerika yandibadde ewa obuyambi bw'ensimbi n'ebintu ebirala ebyetaagisa okusobola okukkakkanya endowooza ezitali nnungi gavumenti ze yalina.
It would be the way it used similar tactics to dissuade Museveni from his Marxist economic policies of barter trade and state control of the commanding heights of the economy.	Yandikozeseza enkola y'emu gye yakozesa okuggyamu Museveni endowooza y'ekikominisiti ekwata ku by'ensubulagana eby'okuwanyisanganya eby'amaguzi.
It is wrong for President Museveni to see in every initiative by the Somalis the hand of “ideologies” from the “Middle East”, whatever that means.	Kikyamu pulezidenti Museveni okugamba nti Abasomaali abalwanirira ensi yaabwe bakolera ku ndowooza y'abantu b'omu kyondo kya Buwalabu.
On Tuesday, we were taken to court and I was told I had no case to answer.	Ku Lwokubiri nnatwalibwa mu kkooti naye ne baŋŋamba nti ssalina musango gwonna.
Instead of being released, I was taken back to Bramelene Prison to clear myself.	Mu kifo ky'okundeka ŋŋende, nnazibwayo mu kkomera lye Bramelene mbeeko byemaliriza.
I spent two days there and was finally released on Thursday.	Eyo nnamalayo ennuku bbiri oluvannyuma ne banta ku Lwokuna.
Placed security sources in Uganda told The Independent that Kayumba approached Kashaka and asked him to help establish contact with Kagame.	Ab'eby'okwerinda mu Uganda baagamba olupapula lwa Independent nti Kayumba yatuukirira Kashaka n'amusaba abayambe okutuukirira Kagame.
Kashaka consulted President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and sought his guidance.	Kashaka yeebuuza ku Pulezidenti Museveni owa Uganda ng'ayagala omuwe obulagirizi.
It seems Museveni gave it a go ahead.	Kirabika Museveni yamukkiriza okugenda mu maaso.
Kashaka then contacted Kigali and delivered the message that Kayumba wanted to “talk”.	"Awo Kashaka n'atwala Ekigali obubaka Kayumba bwe yali ayagala ""okwogera."""
Kagame was informed of this effort but he was sceptical.	Kagame yagambibwa okufuba okwali kukoleddwa naye yali abuusabusa.
First, Kayumba had appeared on Voice of America and made scathing criticisms of the government and Kagame personally.	Okusooka Kayumba yali alabikidde ku ttivi eyitibwa Voice of America ng'avvumirira nnyo gavumenti ne Kagame kennyini.
Second, sources say that Kagame believes, on the basis of intelligence information that Kayumba was behind recent grenade attacks in Kigali.	Ekyokubiri, ensonda ezimu zigamba nti Kagame kennyini akikkiriza nti okusinziira ku kunoonyereza okwakolebwa, Kayumba ye yali emabega wa bbomu ezaakubibwa mu Kigali.
The Rwandan president does not forgive such things easily.	Pulezidenti w'e Rwanda tamala gasonyiwa bintu ng'ebyo.
However, some Kagame loyalists impressed it upon their boss that the country was better off having Kayumba inside than outside of it.	Kyokka abamu ku abo abakkiririza ennyo mu Kagame baamugamba nti kyandibadde kirungi eri eggwanga singa Kayumba abeera munda mu kifo ky'okubeera ebweru.
Kagame felt conceding to such logic would be like giving in to blackmail.	Kagame yalowooza nti okukolera ku magezi ng'ago kwandibadde ng'okwekkiriranya n'okukkiriza okusiigibwa enziro.
Kashaka had offered to travel from South Africa to Kigali to begin discussions with key Rwanda Patriotic Front insiders.	Kashaka yali yeewaddeyo okuva e South Afirika agende e Kigali asobole okutandika okuteesaganya n'abakulu b'ekibiina ekiyitibwa Rwanda Patriotic Front.
Those concerned argued that a Ugandan military member could not travel to Kigali from Pretoria without Museveni’s personal approval.	Abo be kyali kikwatako baagamba nti omujaasi mu ggye lya Uganda tayinza kuva Pretoria n'agenda e Kigali nga Museveni tamukkiriza.
It is then that information arrived in Kigali that Kayumba’s driver had been issued with a Ugandan passport.	Awo obubaka we bwatuukira e Kagali nti duleyiva wa Kayumba yali awereddwa pasipota y'e Uganda.
Uganda and Rwanda share a complicated relationship characterised by intrigue, dexterity and double crossing.	Uganda ne Rwanda balina bye bafaanaganya mu nkolagana yaabwe gamba nga enkwe, obumanyirivu n'ensalo.
Rwanda learnt that when Kayumba left for South Africa, Ugandan intelligence kept close contact with him.	Rwanda yakitegerako nti Kayumba bwe yagenda mu South Afirika, abakeessi ba Uganda beeyongera okukolagana naye.
Kigali was told that Bichisha’s passport was delivered to him by the Ugandan police.	Kigali yagambibwa nti owa polisi w'e Uganda ye yatwalira Bichisha paasipota ye.
His air ticket was reportedly bought by the Ugandan police.	Kiragambibwa nti poliisi ya Uganda ye yamugulira ttikiti y'ennyonyi.
He was also reportedly driven to the airport by the Ugandan police.	Era kigambibwa nti poliisi ya Uganda ye yamutwala ku kisaawe ky'ennyonyi.
Later in his prison cell, Gakwerera says, Bichisha revealed all this Ugandan police involvement to him.	Oluvannyuma ng'ali mu kkomera, Gakwereza agamba nti Bishisha yakyasanguza nti poliisi ya Uganda ye yamuyamba.
Upon release, Gakwerere informed Rwandan authorities.	Gakwerere bwe yava mu kkomera ye yategeza ab'obuyinza mu Rwanda.
As top Rwanda Patriotic Front officials pondered what Museveni’s game plan was in this Kayumba saga, “a friend” from the American Central Intelligence Agency called Kigali.	Awo ekitongole ekikeessi ekya Amerika ne kikuba essimu e Kigali.
He claimed that Kayumba had sent a message to Museveni seeking contact.	Yagamba nti Kayumba yali aweerezza Museveni obubaka ng'ayagala kumutuukirira.
He said he had confirmed from reliable Ugandan security sources that Museveni had received Kayumba’s message .	Yagamba nti kino yali akikakasizza okuva mu nsonda z'eby'okwerinda ezeesigika mu Uganda nti Museveni yali afunye obubaka bwa Kayumba.
However, it seemed the Ugandan president had not responded to it, at least not yet.	Kyokka kirabika nti pulezidenti wa Uganda yali tannamuddamu.
Was Museveni betting his time yet It is in this context that Kayumba was shot?	Kayumba we yakubirwa amasasi kyandiba nga Museveni yali akyerowooza?
In Kigali, core people sat to assess the issue.	Mu Kigali abakulu baatuula okwekenenya ensonga eno.
One option was that a faction among them could have taken it upon itself to shoot Kayumba.	Kitebeerezebwa nti wayinza okubaawo abamu ku bo abaasalawo okukuba Kayumba amasasi.
Dicta Asiimwe, in the Election Watch under the 2011 national elections, said, the Democratic Party has started its primaries to elect leaders for all the party’s political positions in the country.	Mu mawulire agayitibwa Election Watch Dicta Asiimwe yagamba nti, ekibiina ky'eby'obufuzi ekya Democratic Party kitandise okulonda okw'okusunsulamu abakulembeze baakyo ku bifo byonna mu ggwanga.
The one month exercise will end on August 25.	Omulimu guno ogwokumala omwezi ogumu gujja kukomekkerezebwa nga Agusto 25.
According to the party spokesperson Emmanuel Mwaka Lutukumoi, Democratic Party district councils will choose the dates when they want to hold the primaries in their respective areas. 	Okusinziira ku mwogezi w'ekibiina Emmanuel Mwaka Lutukumoi bakansala ba disitulikiti ab'ekibiina kya DP bajja kusalawo ennaku kwe banaaberera n'okulonda kwabwe okw'okusunsulibwamu.
However, they must submit names of the flag bearers immediately after August 25.	Naye basaanidde okuwaayo amannya g'abo abanaabakwatira bbendera amangu ddala oluvannyuma lwa Agusito 25.
The party has also asked members who will stand as party flag bearers to pay two hundred thousand shillings to the party treasury for Member of Parliament.	Ekibiina era kisabye abo abanaakikwatira bbendera okusasula emitwalo amakumi abiri eri omuwanika w'ekibiina akola ku babaka ba palamenti.
However, Democratic Party Secretary General Matia Nsubuga says the members know the money is necessary to prepare for the primaries.	Kyokka omuwandiisi w'okuntiko ow'kibiina kya DP Matia Nsubuga agamba nti bamemba bakimanyi nti sente zeetaagisa okusobola okutekega okulonda.
"“We are not like the National Resistance Movement"", Matia Nsubuga said."	"Matia Nsubuga yagamba nti ""ffe tetuli nga ab'ekibiina kya NRM."
We get our money from our supporters,” Nsubuga added.	"Era Nsubuga yagattako nti ""ffe sente tuzifuna okuva mu bawagizi baffe."""
He says that while the National Resistance Movement uses public funds for the party activities, Democratic Party has to raise money from its supporters to finance party activities.	Agamba nti wadde nga aba NRM bo bakozesa ssente za gavumenti okusobola okutegeka okulonda kwabwe, bo aba DP ssente balina kuzifuna kuva mu bawagizi baabwe. okusobola okukola ku byetaago byabwe.
However, Lulume Bayiga, Buikwe South Member of Parliamnet and the Secretary General of the Sam Lubega faction, says, Democratic Party would be better off  settling the internal divisions first.	Naye kyandibadde kirungi nnyo ekibiina okusooka okumalawo enjawukana ezikirimu.
He says he believes the Democratic Party President Norbert Mao and Secretary General Matia Nsubuga are not interested in the party reconciliation.	Ye alowooza nti pulezidenti wa DP Nobart Mao ne Ssabawandiisi w'ekibiina Matia Nsubuga tebaagala kibiina kibe bumu.
Mukono North Member of Parliament Betty Nambooze says, she will participate in the Mao led Democratic Party’s primaries despite the fact that the two have not been on good terms.   	Omubaka wa palamenti owa Mukono north Betty Nambooze agamba nti ajja kwetaba mu kulonda kwa DP okutegekebwa Mao wadde nga tebabadde na nkolaga nnungi.
This was because Mao had sided with the former party President Sebaana Kizito and went to Mbale for the delegate’s conference living Nambooze and other party members behind.	Kino kiri kityo kubanga Mao yali akwataganye ne eyali omukulembeze w'ekibiina kya DP Ssebaana Kizito ne bagenda e Mbale mu ttabamiruka w'ekibiina nga Nambooze ne bamemba abalala babalese.
“We shall have nominations for the general elections in two months, and we have to be prepared to participate,” Nambooze said.	"Nambooze yagamba nti: ""mu myezi ebiri tujja kuba n'okusunsulamu abo abaneenyigira mu kulonda okw'awamu era tulina okwetegeka okukwenyigiramu."
Nambooze also joined Suubi a coalition of Buganda politicians aligned to Inter-Party Cooperation and is currently in conflict with Democrtic Party.	Nambooze era yeegatta ku Suubi ekibiina omwegattira bannabyabufuzi abava mu Buganda era nga mu kiseera kino ekibiina kino tekikwatagana na kibiina kya DP.
The party has also castigated Kampala Central Member of Parliament Erias Lukwago for supporting the Inter-Party Cooperation.	Ekibiina era kivumiridde nnyo omubaka wa palamenti ow'e Kampala Erias Lukwago olw'okuwagira akabondo kano ak'ababaka abava mu bibiina by'obufuzi ebitali bimu.
Lutukumoi said those “renegade” members are welcome to contest in the Democratic Party primaries but they are warned.	"Lutukumoi yagamba nti ""bakyewagula abo baddembe okuvuganya mu kusunsulibwa kw'ekibiina kya DP naye beeralikirivu."
He said this because the party would field candidates to stand against Democratic Party members who will not participate in the party’s primaries.	Kino yakyogera kubanga ekibiina kijja kusimbawo ababaka ate abajja okuvuganya bannakibiina bannaabwe abanaaba tebayise mu kusunsulibwa.
He says the party constitution requires that candidates who stand on the Democratic Party ticket must first go through the primaries.	Yagamba nti amateeka g'ekibiina gakirambika bulungi nti abo abeesimbawo ku ttikiti ya DP balina okusooka okusunsulibwa.
“We are doing this under the party constitution and everybody must abide by it,” Lutukumoi says.	"Lutukumoi yagamba nti: ""kino tukikolera wansi w'amateeka agafuga ekibiina buli muntu yenna g'alina okugoberera."""
Nambooze asked why she was being asked whether she will participate in the primaries if that is the position she will take while Lukwago did not confirm his participation.	Nambooze yabuuza ensonga lwaki yali abuuzibwa obanga annenyigira mu kusunsulibwa ate ng'ekyo kye yali asazeewo okukola. Ate ye Lukwago abadde tannakakasa obanga annenyigiramu.
The Democratic Party National Women Chairperson Maxensia Takirambule accused Nambooze and other “renegade” Democratic Party members of confusing the public by associating with Suubi 2011.	"Maxensia Takirambule akola nga nnyinintebe w'abakyala mu kibiina kya DP anenyeza nnyo Nambooze ne ""bakyewaggula"" abalala aba DP olw'okubuzaabuza abantu nga beegatta ku Suubi 2011."
Suubi 2011 which is a political pressure group allied to Inter-Party Cooperation, and then claiming they are members of Democratic Party.	Suubi 2011 kibiina ekyegattirwamu bannabyabufuzi okuva mu bibiina eby'enjawulo, ate mu kiseera kye kimu ne beeyita aba DP.
She said they should be Democratic Party or stay in Suubi and leave the party.	Agamba nti bano basaanidde okuba mu kibiina kya DP oba okukivaamu ne basigala mu Suubi.
The Independent of July 30 - August 05, 2010, had Solomon Kimbugwe reporting that the Conservative Party had named an unknown candidate as its flag bearer to challenge two presidential candidates.	Solomon Kimbugwe munnamawulire w'olupapula lwa independenti olwa Jjulaayi okuva nga 30 okutuuka nga Agusito 5 2010, yawandiika nti ekibiina kya CP kyali kirina omuntu atamanyiddwa gwe kyogeddeko ng'anaabakwatira bbendera avuganye n'abantu ababiri abeesimbyewo okuvuganya ku kifo kya pulezidenti.
Those two were Forum for Democratic Change’s Kizza Besigye and Olara Otunnu of Uganda People's Congress for the Interparty Cooperation’s joint candidate in the national presidential elections.	Ku abo ababiri kwe kuli Kizza Besigye owa FDC ne Olara Otunu owa UPC
Lukwago and Nambooze were wondering whether the “renegades” will take part in Democratic Party primaries?	"Lukwago ne Namboozi baali beebuuza obanga ""bakyewaggula"" bannenyigira mu kusunsulibwa kw'ekibiina kya DP."
Prof. James Kigongo has no known political or public profile other than having once been a head of the Department of Philosophy at Makerere University.	Tewaliwo nnyo kya maanyi kimanyiddwa ku Omukenkufu James Kigongo ku nsonga z'eby'obufuzi oba ku bikwata ku mirimu gye emirala okuggyako okuba nti olumu yakulemberako ekitongole mu Ssetendekero wa Makerere.
The highest known political leadership position he has held is advisor to Conservative Party President Ken Lukyamuzi.	Ekifo ekisingayo okuba ekya waggulu kye yali abaddemu mu by'obufuzi kwe kuba nti yaliko omuwi w'amagezi wa pulezidenti wa CP Ken Lukyamuzi.
Kigongo was elected during the Conservative Party national conference of 60 delegates representing the regions rather than districts, on July, 23 in Kampala.	Kigongo yalondebwa mu kiseera kya ttabamiruka w'ekibiina kya CP eky'ababaka 60 abakiikirira ebitundu so si disitulikiti era kino kyaliwo mu Jjulaayi nga 23 e Kampala.
He defeated Wasiebe Magina, the Conservative Party Vice Chairman for Eastern region with 32 votes out of 60 voting delegates.	Yawangula Wasiebe Magina, omumyuka wa CP mu Buvanjuba n'obululu 32 ku obwo 60 obwakubibwa.
Probably the biggest thing the election of Kigongo has proved is that the federalism is its strong value.	Oboolyawo ekintu ekisingayo obukulu ekikakasiddwa mu kulondebwa kwa Kigongo kwe kuba nti ekibiina kino kizimbiddwa ku musingi gwa federo.
Kigongo is a known monarchist and federalist.	Kimanyiddwa bulungi nti Kigongo awagira nnyo obwakabaka ne federo.
This shows that Buganda’s most cherished value of federalism would be a key component of the Inter-party Cooperation.	Kino kiba kiraga nti federo Buganda gy'esinga okutwala ng'ekikulu ennyo y'ejja okuba ku mwanjo mu kibiina kino ekigattira awamu ebibiina byonna.
However sending Kigongo to face Besigye and Otunnu in a political race is like placing apples and mangoes together and ask customers to pick the better choice.	Kyokka bw'oleeta Kigongo avuganye Besigye ne Otunu obanga eddidde ekibala kya appo n'emiyembe n'obiteeka mu kisero n'ogamba omuntu alondeko ky'asinga okwagala.
It suggests, and rather strongly, that the race for the opposition presidential candidate realistically lies between Otunnu and Besigye.	Kino kiba kyeyoleka kaati nti embiranye ku ludda oluvuganya gavumenti okusinga ejja kuba wakati wa Besigye ne Otunnu.
However there is an important, though not crucial, a lesson from the election of Kigongo to hold the torch for Conservative Party.	Naye waliwo ensonga enkulu wadde nga si ya maanyi nnyo mu kulondebwa kwa Kigongo okukwattira ekibiina kya CP etaala.
All political parties have demonstrated this except the National Resistance Movement.	Ebibiina by'obufuzi byonna bikikoze okuggyako ekya NRM.
Uganda People's Congress has changed its leadership from Miria Obote to Otunnu in less than five years.	Mu bbanga eritasukka myaka etaano UPC ekyusizza obukulembeze bwaayo ne buva ku Maria Obote ne budda ku Otunnu.
Miria Obote had been elected after the death of her husband Milton Obote who had been the exile party president.	Maria Obute yalondebwa oluvannyuma lw'okufa kw'omwami we Milton Obote eyali akulemberera ekibiina kino mu buwaŋŋanguse.
The Democratic Party, its internal wrangles not withstanding, has changed its leadership twice since the National Resistance Movement came to power in 1986.	Ng'oggyeko enjawukana eziri mu kibiina kya DP,  kyo kyakakyusa obukulembeze bwakyo emirundi ebiri bukya NRM ejja mu buyinza mu 1986
The Forum for Democratic Change, the youngest of the big four parties, having been formed in 2004, is also likely to change its leadership after 2011.	Ate kyo ekibiina kya FDC ekisngayo obuto mu bibiiina ebinene ebina era nga kyatandikibwawo mu 2004 nakyo kisuubirwa okukyusa obukulembeze bwakyo mu 2011.
The incumbent Dr. Kizza Besigye has already said he will not seek re-election to lead the party beyond the current term.	Omukulembeze w'ekibiina kino Dr. Kizza Besigye yagamba nti tajja kuddamu kwesimbawo ng'ekisanja kye kiweddeko.
Among parties that are more than 10 years old, it’s only the National Resistance Movement that has not changed its top leadership or elected a new candidate.	Mu bibiina byonna ebyakamala emyaka egisukka mu kkumi, ekibiina kya NRM kyokka kye kitakyusanga bukulembeze bwakyo obwoku ntikko.
It has been Museveni in the last 24 years.	Museveni y'abaddewo mu myaka 24 egiyise.
Museveni has been the chairman of the National Resistance Movement since 1986 when it took over power.	Museveni y'abadde ssentebe wa NRM okuviira ddala mu 1986 lwe yajja mu buyinza.
The argument that the National Resistance Movement only became a party in 2003 but had been a system since 1986 only exists in form not in substance.	Eky'okugamba nti NRM yafuka ekibiina ky'eby'obufuzi mu 2003 naye nti okuva mu mwaka 1986 ebadde nkola ya mugendo, ebyo byo bigambo bugambo.
In 2002 the Constitutional Court ruled that the Movement was a political party disguising as a “system” because it had a chairman and all structures of a party no matter what one called it.	Mu 2002 kkooti ya ssemateeka yasalawo nti NRM kyali kibiina kya bya bufuzi wadde nga kyali kyefula okuba omugendo obugendo kubanga kyalina ssentebe na byonna ebikigwanyiza okuba ekibiina.
Is Uganda seeing the dawn of peaceful transition from one political leadership to another or is this just a cosmetic change?	Kati tusuubire nti mu Uganda mujja kubaamu enkyukakyuka ey'emirembe mu bakulembeze b'eby'obufuzi oba kino kifaananyi bufaananyi?
In the Independent, in the  Jul 30 - Aug 05, 2010 news, Ken Lukyamuzi was featured under national elections news.	Mu mawulire ga Independent aga Jjulaayi 30 okutuuka ku Agusito 5, 2010 Ken Lukyamuzi yayogerwako mu kitundu ekikwata ku by'okulonda mu ggwanga.
Sam Serwanga wrote about the election violence between the years of 1980 and 2011.	Sam Serwanga yawandiika ku bukambwe obweyolekera mu kulonda wakati mu myaka gya 1980 ne 2011.
Mr. Nakendo is Vice Chairman of the Military Commission.	Mwami Nakendo ye mumyuka wa ssentebe w'akakiiko k'amagye.
"""Yoweri Museveni does not have a private army"", said Nakendo."	"Nakendo yagamba nti ""Yoweri Museveni talina magye gage ku bubwe."""
Museveni, the president of the Uganda Patriotic Movement, one of the four political parties contesting next Wednesday’s general elections, was allegedly said to be commanding and training a private army.	Museveni nga pulezidenti w'ekibiina ky'eby'obufuzi ekiyitibwa UPM, ekimu ku bibiina ebina ebivuganya mu kulondebwa okunaabaawo ku Lwokusatu olujja, kigambibwa nti alina eggye ly'addumira era ly'atendeka.
The chairman of the military commission, Mr. Paulo Muwanga disclosed this during a Uganda Peoples Congress rally at Kashongi in Nyabushozi, Museveni’s home area.	Bino byayogerwa Paul Muwanga ssentebe w'akakiiko k'amagye mu lukuŋŋaana lwa UPC olwali e Kashongi mu Nyabushozi ekitundu Museveni gy'asibuka.
Muwanga who has been on a six day grueling tour of remote places, addressing Uganda People's Congress rallies in Mpigi, Masaka and Mbarara districts, gave a stern warning to Dr. Bernard Buzabo.

The World Bank and other donors on August 9, fired a warning shot of a 10% cut of their budget support to Uganda.	Bbanka y'ensi yonna awamu n'abagabirizi b'obuyambi abalala nga 9, baawa okulabula okw'amaanyi bwe baasala ku buyambi bwe bawa Uganda ebitundu kkumi ku buli kikumi.
"This was because the Uganda government had failed to address the “high-level corruption""."	Kino kyakolebwa kubanga gavumenti ya Uganda yali eremereddwa okukola ku buli bw'enguzi obukudde eggyembe.

In the summer of 1995, former United States president, Jimmy Carter, organised a conference on Rwanda in Tunis.	Mu kyeya kya 1995, Jimmy Carter eyaliko pulezidenti w'Amerika yateekateeka olukuŋŋaana mu kibuga Tunis nga lukwata ku Rwanda.
"The conference was to “convince"" the Rwandan Patriotic Front to be more ethnically inclusive by appointing Hutu politicians to cabinet."	Ekigendererwa ky'olukuŋŋaana olwo kwali okumatiza gavumenti ya Rwanda okussaawo kabineeti ey'ekintabuli nga mulimu ne bannabyabufuzi Abahutu.
In attendance were the presidents of Rwanda’s neighbours; Zaire’s Mobutu Sese Seko, Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni and Tanzania’s Ali Hassan Mwinyi.	Mu lukuŋŋaana olwo mwalimu baliraanwa ba Rwanda gamba nga pulezidenti wa Zaire Mobutu Sese Seko, owa Uganda Yoweri Museveni n'owa Tanzania Ali Hassan Mwinyi.
Rwanda’s Pasteur Bizimungu was in attendance as well as former Tanzanian president, Julius Nyerere.	Mwalimu ne pulezidenti wa Rwanda Pasteur Bizimungu awamu ne eyaliko pulezidenti wa Tanzaniya Julius Nyerere.
During the coffee break, they sat down for an informal chat with Carter.	Bwe baali nga banywa ku kakyayi, balina bye baayogerako ne Carter.
The former United States president turned to Bizimungu and asked him why he doesn't appoint a few Hutu into his cabinet.	Eyaliko pulezidenti wa Amerika yabuuza Bizimungu ensonga lwaki tabaako Abahutu b'alonda okubeera ku kabineeti.
Bizimungu requested Carter to direct the question to Nyerere.	Bizimungu yasaba Carter ekibuuzo ekyo akibuuze Nyerere.
Carter asked Julius pensively, “why can’t the Rwandan Patriotic Front appoint at least one Hutu to cabinet?” 	"Carter yabuuza Julius nti, ""Lwaki gavumenti ya Rwanda terondayo waakiri omu ku Bahutu n'abeera ku kabineeti?"""
"""This would reflect ethnic inclusion” Carter added. "	Carter yagattako nti singa kino kikolebwa kyandiraze nti tewaliiwo busosoze mu mawanga.
"Nyerere answered in his characteristic sarcastic style; “I do not answer questions about tribes""."	"Nyerere yaddamu mu ngeri ye ey'okujeregerera nti: ""Nze siddamu bibuuzo bikwata ku mawanga""."
"""Ask Mobutu over there since he is the master of tribal politics"", Julius added."	Julius yagattako nti buuza Mobutu wuuwo okuva bwe kiri nti ye kakensa w'eby'obufuzi ebyawula mu mawangaa.
A frustrated Carter turned to Africa’s iconic predator.	Carter ng'atabuddwa, yakyukira ensolo enkambwe ey'omu Afirika.
“Mr President,” he began, looking in the eyes of Mobutu, “why can’t the Rwandan Patriotic Front appoint a Hutu politician to cabinet? 	"""Ow'ekitiibwa pulezidenti,"" awo n'atunuulira Mobutu mu maaso, ""lwaki mu kabineeti ya Rwanda temuli bannabyabufuzi Abahutu?"""
The Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu is also a Hutu.	Ssabaminisita Faustin Twagiramungu naye Muhutu.
Some Rwandans seated at a table beyond, immediately drew up a list of the cabinet and gave it to Carter.	Abanyarwanda abalala abaali batudde awo ku mmeeza ne batandika okunokolayo abalala, era amangu ago ne bakola olukalala lwa baminisita ne baluwa Carter.
More than 60 percent of ministers were actually Hutu.	Ebitundu ebisukka mu nkaaga ku buli kikumi baali baminisita Abahutu.
Carter was shocked and turned to all the other leaders and asked: “Why then are we holding this conference?”	"Carter yawuniikirira nnyo era n'akyukira abakulembeze abalala bonna n'ababuuza nti: ""Kati olwo olukuŋŋaana luno lwaki?"""
This farce tends to characterise a lot of political discussions about Rwanda in Western media but most worryingly in Africa.	Kino kigendereddwamu okukubaganya ebirowoozo ku Rwanda ku mikutu gy'amawulire egy'e Bulaaya naye ng'okusingira ddala kikanga abali mu Afirika.
The narrative on Rwanda about Hutu and Tutsi nursing hatred has been spanning for centuries.	Okumala ebyesa n'ebyasa kibadde kyogerwa nti Abahutu n'Abatusi tebaagalanira ddala.
It is one of those grand distortions of history that has left an indelible mark on Rwanda's politics.	Obulimba ng'obwo obuli mu byafaayo bwe busiize enziro ku by'obufuzi bwa Rwanda.
There is no writing of precolonial Rwanda that shows that the Hutu-Tutsi had constituted an antagonistic relationship.	Tewaliiwo biwandiiko ebikwata ku Rwanda ng'abafuzi b'amatwale tebannajja biraga nti Abatusi n'Abahutu babaddenga tebaagalana.
Indeed, even the broader story of deeply entrenched ethnic hatreds between African tribes is part of this distorted narrative. 	Mu butuufu n'ebyafaayo ebikwata ku bulabe obwasimba amakanda mu mawanga g'omu Afirika kitundu ku bulimba buno.
This narrative was fostered by 19th century European sociology and political anthology.	Bino byonna byasavuwazibwa omuntu omu okuva mu Bulaaya mu kyasa ekya 19.
Political tribalism in Africa is as modern as the ipad that is created and recreated by elites daily.	Eby'obufuzi bya Afirika ebyesigamiziddwa ku njawukana mu mawanga si bikadde nga bw'olaba essimu ezikolebwa ate ne ziddamu okukolebwa buli lunaku.
It is not surprising therefore that an Afrobarometer survey of 2009 found ethnic consciousness strongest among elites than ordinary peasants.	Kale tekyewuunyisa nti okusinziira ku kunoonyereza okwakolebwa mu 2009 kyazuulibwa nti enjawukana mu mawanga okusinga eri abo abatwalibwa okuba abagezi ennyo okusinga bw'eri mu bantu aba wansi.
Sadly, many African intellectuals and elites accept European anthropology as a fact. 	Eky'ennaku kiri nti abagezi bangi mu Afirika batwala endowooza y'abazungu okuba nti ye ntuufu.
They don't know that some of our continent’s largest “tribes” like Kikuyu and Yoruba were created by the colonial state.	Tebakimanyi nti amawanga agamu agasinga obunene mu ssemazinga waffe gamba nga Abakyukuyu n'Abayoruba gaatondebwawo abafuzi b'amatwale.
But once created, these identities took on a life of their own.	Naye kasita gaamala okutondebwawo ne gatandika okugoberera empisa ezaabwe ku bwabwe.
"For example, Rwandan Patriotic Front recently changed the name of the genocide from the “Rwandan genocide” to the “Tutsi genocide""."	"Ng'ekyokulabirako, gye buvuddeko awo gavumenti ya Rwanda yakyusa erinnya ly'ekitta bantu okuva ku ""Kitta bantu ekyali e Rwanda"" ne liba ""Ekitta abatuusi."""
Because its legitimacy is partly based on having ended genocide, Rwandan Patriotic Front has constantly used the genocide to promote itself politically.	Olw'okuba baakola kinene okukomya ekitta bantu, gavumenti ya Rwanda yeyongedde okukozesa ekitta bantu ekyo okwenywereza mu bufuzi.
There is also a possibility of focusing on public policy as a campaign platform and recognising the dangers Rwanda faces from ethnic politics.	Ate essira liyinza okuteekebwa ku nkola erina okugobererwa abantu bonna era kino ne kikozesebwa okulaga obuzibu Rwanda bw'eyolekaganye nabwo mu by'obufuzi obwesigamiziddwa ku njawukana mu mawanga.
Politicians in the West can fight over public policy issues like healthcare.	Bannabyabufuzi mu mawanga g'Abazungu basobola okulwanirira ensonga ezikwata ku bantu gamba ng'ensonga ekwata ku by'obulamu.
Africans are expected to fight over identity.	Abafirika bo balwanirira kumanyika.
In pitching their campaign on public policy issues, the Social Democratic Party has made itself look like pretenders in the race.	Nga kampeyini yaabwe bagyesigamizizza ku nsonga ezikwata ku bantu bonna, ekibiina kya Social Democratic Party kiringa ekisaagirira obusaagirizi.
In other words, they are Kagame’s auxiliaries.	Mu ngeri endala, bawagizi ba Kagame.
It is clear to me that Rwandans are not very boisterous.	Kati nkitegeera bulungi nti Abanyarwanda si bantu bazibu nnyo.
For those who ignore specificity, they conclude that this is because the Rwandan Patriotic Front and Kagame have suffocated free speech.	Abantu ababuusa amaaso ebintu ebyenkukunala, bawunzika bagamba nti eno ye nsonga lwaki gavumenti ya Rwanda ne Kagame bamazeewo eddembe ery'okwogera.
The Independent of  August 13 - 19, 2010 said those who know Rwanda well, will tell a crowd attending an oppostion party campaign. 	Olupapula lw'amawulire oluyitibwa Independenti olwa Agusito nga 13 okutuuk nga 19, 2010 lwagamba nti abo abamanyi obulungi Rwanda basobola okutegeera abantu ababa bali mu lukuŋŋaana lw'ekibiina ky'eby'obufuzi ekivuganya gavumenti.
Oppostion parties in Rwanda include Social Democratic Party.	Mu bibiina by'obufuzi ebiri e Rwanda mwe muli ekya Social Democratic Party.
It could be that the five hundred years of strong and authoritarian states has given Rwandans a distinct deference to authority.	Kiyinzika okuba nti emyaka ebitaano egy'obufuzi obw'amaanyi era obwannakyemalira bwe busobozesezza Abanyarwanda okuba n'obuyinza obw'enjawulo.
Rwandans seem obedient to a fault.	Kirabika Abanyarwanda oli ne bw'aba mukyamu baba bawulize gy'ali.
On August 4, I drove from Kigali to Kirehe near the border to Tanzania.	Nga 4 Agusito, nnavuga nnenva e Kigali ne ŋŋenda e Kirehe okumpi n'ensalo y'e Tanzaniya.
I was shocked at the masses of people who were walking on foot to go attend Kagame’s rally there.	Nnewuunya nnyo bwe nnalaba enkuyanja y'abantu abali batambuza ebigere nga bagenda mu lukuŋŋaana lwa Kagame.
At Kagame’s rallies, I was continuously struck by the level and effectiveness of organisation.	Nga ndi mu lukuŋŋaana lwa Kagame nneeyongera okwewuunya engeri gye lwali lutegekeddwamu obulungi.
This level of organisation is only made possible by the obedience of ordinary Rwandans to what the authorities have told them.	Entegeka ennungi ey'ekika kino ebaawo olw'okuba Abanyarwanda aba bulijjo bawulize eri ab'obuyinza ababa babagambye okukikola.
The Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Defence, Jack Nziza, said that even under former President Habyarimana, this capacity for mobilisation existed.	Omuwandiis ow'enkalakalira mu minisutule y'eby'okwerinda Jack Nziza yagamba nti ne mu bufuzi bwa Habyarimana eyaliko pulezidenti wa Rwanda, kino bwe kityo bwe kyabanga.
“Rwanda has always had a strong state,” Nziza said wistfully.	Nziza yagamba nti bulijjo Rwanda ebaddenga ne gavumenti ya maanyi.
The problem was that Habyarimana did not employ this vital national asset for development but largely for remaining in power.	Ekizibu ekyaliwo kiri nti Habyarimana teyakozesa bantu bano mu ngeri ey'okukulaakulanya ensi wabula okwenywereza mu buyinza.
If the Rwandan Patriotic Front seeks to undermine free expression, it is easy for them to secure compliance from the population.	Bwe kiba nti gavumenti ya Rwanda erina ekigendererwa eky'okumalawo eddembe ly'okweyogerera, kino kiba kibasobozesa okuleetera abantu bonna okuba abawulize.
Rwanda enjoys the rare capacity of an African state that has unprecedented capacity to penetrate society and the public with its desires.	Rwanda obutafaananako nsi yonna mu Afirika esobola bulungi okutuukirira abantu nga bw'eba eyagadde.
John Bosco Nivuyekure, aged 28, is a Hutu peasant in Ngoma, Rwanda.	John Bosco Nivuyekure ow'emyaka 28, Muhutu era mulimi mu kitundu ekiyitibwa Ngoma, mu Rwanda.
I met him at a poorly attended rally of Ntawurikuryayo on August 7.	Nnamusanga mu lukuŋŋaana olutaalimu bantu bangi olwali tutegekeddwa Ntawurikuryayo nga 7 Agusito.
He was soft spoken, laid back and expressed little enthusiasm in his candidate while others sang and chanted support for Ntawurikuriryayo.	Yali ayogeza simbo, ng'atudde emabega era nga talaga ssanyu lingi eri oyo eyali yeesimbyewo wadde ng'abalala baali bayimba era nga bwe bajaganya nga bawagira Ntawurikuriryayo.
Nivuyekure said he joined Social Democratic Party because it stands for justice, development and social welfare.	Nivuyekure yagamba nti yayingira ekibiina ky'eby'obufuzi ekya Democratic Party kubanga kirwanirira obwenkanya, okukulaakulana n'embeera z'abantu.
When I asked why there were so few people out to support the Social Democratic Party, Nivuyekure had an answer.	Bwe nnabuuza ensonga lwaki abantu baali batono nnyo abaali bazze okuwagira ekibiina kya Social Democratic Party, Nivuyekure yalina eky'okuddamu.
He said that people who do not support Rwandan Patriotic Front are afraid to be seen publicly.	Yagamba nti abantu abatawagira kibiina ky'eby'obufuzi ekifuga Rwanda batya okuvaayo mu lwatu.
He said that, the local leaders who are largely Rwandan Patriotic Front will discriminate against you if you support other political parties.	Yagamba nti abakulembeze b'ekitundu ate ng'abasinga obungi ku bo ba mu kibiina ekifuga bakusosola bw'owagira ekibiina ekirala.
One of the greatest achievements Rwanda has registered over the last ten years is the impersonal application of public policy.	Ekimu ku bintu ebikulu ennyo Rwanda by'etuuseeko mu myaka kkumi egiyise kwe kussa mu nkola ebyo ebikwata ku bantu aba bulijjo.
I asked Nivuyekure if his children are stopped from going to school or his family is denied fertilizers or mutual health.	Nnabuuza Nivuyekure obanga abaana be balemesebwa okugenda ku ssomero era obanga ab'omu maka ge tebaweeebwa bigimusa oba obujjanjabi bwe beetaaga.
This was because some over enthusiastic “Rwandan Patriotic Front-looking” election official came asking for our accreditation, which he did not have.	Kyali kityo kubanga abamu ku abo abalabika ng'abawigira ennyo ekibiina ekiri mu buyinza ekya Rwanda bajja babuuza ebisaanyizo ate nga ye yali tabirina.
Sam Mutabaruka is another Social Democratic Party supporter I met at Ntawukuriryayo rally in Bugesera.	Ate era mu lukuŋŋaana olwo olwali mu Ntawukuriryayo mu Bugesera n'asangayo Sam Mutabaruka era nga naye muwagizi w'ekibiina kya Social Democratic Party.
Hutu and 33 years, he had the look of an educated and enlightened man.	Yali Muhutu era ng'aweza emyaka 33 egy'obukulu. Yali alabika ng'omuntu omuyigirize.
However, people and their leaders at the local level do not understand this.	Kyokka abantu ab'omu kyalo awamu n'abakulembeze baabwe kino tebakitegera.
He said that Rwandan Patriotic Front leaders at the local level want to please their bosses in Kigali.	Yagamba nti abakulembeze b'ekibiina ekiri mu buyinza abali ku mutendera ogwa wansi baagala kusanyusa bakama baabwe abali e Kigali.
They did this by showing that everyone in their area supports Kagame.	Kino bakikola nga baagala okulaga nti buli muntu mu kitundu kyabwe awagira Kagame.
That is if you are not in Rwandan Patriotic Front supporters.	Nnaddala bw'obanga toli muwagizi w'ekibiina ekiri mu buyinza.
“This tendency needs not be dictated by the centre,” Mutabaruka told me pensively.	"Kino bakama baabwe abali e Kigali si be basaanidde okukikkakkatika ku bantu,"" Mutabaruka kino yakyogera nga mwenyamivu."
That is why Social Democratic Party wants power sharing to begin at village level.	Eno ye nsonga lwaki ab'ekibiina kya Social Democratic Party baagala okugabana obuyinza kutandkire ku mutendera gw'ekyalo.
This is important to undermine the tendency of lower level cadres using subtle ways to induce people to join Rwandan Patriotic Front.	Kino kikulu nnyo okusobola okuggyawo endowooza y'abafuzi b'omu byalo abakozesa engeri enneekusifu okuleetera abantu okuyingira mu kibiiina ekiri mu buyinza.
However, Rwandan Patriotic Front has been dragging its feet on this matter because they are profiting from the current situation.	Kyokka ekibiina ekiri mu buyinza mu Rwanda kikyasimbidde ekkuli ensonga eno kubanga be bakiganyulwamu.
In the end, Kagame romped the election with 93 percent of the votes.	Ku nkomerero, Kagame yawangula okulonda n'ebitundu 93 ku buli kikumi.
That is for the people of Rwanda to decide.	Ekyo Abanyarwanda be balina okukisalawo.
Yet the size of Kagame’s victory only reflects the complexity of Rwanda’s politics.	Kyokka obuwanguzi bwa Kagame obwo bwoleka bwolesi nti eby'obufuzi bw'e Rwanda si byangu.
The Rwandan state under Kagame has been effective in almost all the policy issues.	Gavumenti ya Rwanda ng'ekulemberwa Kagame ekola bulungi kumpi ku buli nsonga yonna.
However, the major issue an opposition candidate can build  on for a strong profile is ethnicity, which is legitimately prohibited in Rwanda.	Kyokka ensonga esinga obukulu abo abali ku ludda oluvuganya gavumenti gye bayinza okussaako essira ye njawukana mu mawanga era nga kino tekikkirizibwa wonna mu Rwanda.
In other words, the opposition candidates have been forced to run on issues where Kagame holds all the aces.	Kyokka abo abeesimbawo ku ludda oluvuganya gavumenti bawamanta buwamansi ensonga ku ebyo byonna Kagame by'asobodde okukola.
In Rwanda the population is 50% Catholics, 40% Protestants and 10% Muslims.	Mu Rwanda abantu ebitundu ataano ku buli kikumi bakatoliki, ana ku buli kikumi bapolositanti ate ekkumi ku buli kikumi basiraamu.
Social Development Party candidate Ntawukuriryayo, votes Liberal Party candidate Higiro votes.	Ntawukuriryayo eyeesimbyewo okukiikirira ekibiina kya Social Development Party alonda, ne Higiro owa Liberal Party naye n'alonda.
Rwandan Patriotic Front candidate Kagame casts his vote.	Kagame ow'ekibiina ekiri mu buyinza naye n'asula akalulu ke.
In the Independent of  August 13 - 19, 2010, Muganwa Gonzaga said the Rwandan Patriotic Front’s Chairman, Paul Kagame, drew unprecedented crowds.	Mu  mawulire ga Independenti aga Agusito nga 13 okutuuka Agusito nga 19, Muganwa Gonzaga yagamba nti ssentebe w'ekibiina ekiri mu buyinza Paul Kagame yasikiriza enkuyanja y'abantu.
It opened on July 20, at Amahoro stadium in Kigali and got bigger in the countryside.	Lwatandika nga 20 Jjulaayi mu kisaawe ky'omupiira eky'e Amahoro mu Kigali ne lugenda nga lweyongera okugejja okutuukira ddala mu bitundu eby'omu byalo.
Even in unexpected areas like the north western districts of Nyabihu and Rubavu, people were cheering and dancing for Kagame.	Wadde ne mu bitundu gye kitasuubirwa gamba nga mu bukiikadyo bwa disitulikiti y'e Nyabihu ne Rubavu, abantu baali booleka obuwagizi bwabwe eri Kagame nga bwe bazina n'amazina.
This is a region that had been the stronghold of former president Juvenal Habyarimana and his Akazu clan.	Ekitundu kino pulezidenti Juvenal Habyarimana n'ekika kye ekya Akazu gye baali basinga okuba n'amaanyi.
The crowds that greeted Kagame indicated how much the Rwandan leader has served as a unifying force in post-genocide Rwanda.	Eky'okuba nti abantu bangi bwe batyo baayaniriza Kagame, kiraga engri omukulembeze wa Rwanda gy'asobodde okugatta abantu oluvannyuma lw'ekitta bantu ekyali e Rwanda.
This has been set up by refugees seeking to return to Rwanda, to a mass movement that encompasses many supporters.	Embeera eno eteereddwawo abanoonyi b'obubudamu abaagala okuddayo e Rwanda basseewo ekibiina ekinaabaamu abawagizi abangi ennyo.
In preparation for this second multi-party election in the history of the country, the Rwandan Patriotic Front seemed well prepared. 	Mu kuteekateeka okulonda okw'omulundi ogwokubiri okwenyigiddemu ebibiina by'obufuzi ebitali bimu mu byafaayo bya Rwanda, ekibiina ekiri mu buyinza kirabika ng'ekyetegese obulungi.
"If his detractors cannot recognize the support he enjoys, Kagame said, ""they can reach for the nearest rope and hang""."	"Kagame yagamba nti bwe kiba nga waliwo abatalaba buwagizi bw'alina, ""bayinza okufuna omuguwa ne beetuga."""
After seven years of presidency, Kagame has been credited with doubling the economy and  lowering crime. 	Kigambibwa nti oluvannyuma lw'emyaka musanvu nga Kagame ye pulezidenti, asobodde okukubisaamu emirundi ebiri mu by'enfuna bya Rwanda era n'okukendeza obumenyi bw'amateeka.
Paul Kagame is re-elected easily on his record of improving food security, empowering women and building up Rwanda’s social welfare system.	Kyangu nnyo okuddamu okulonda Kagame okusinziira ku ebyo by'akoze gamba nga okuyamba abantu okuba n'emmere emala, abakyala okubawa obuyinza n'okudaabulula ebyo ebyekuusa ku mbeera z'abantu.
Nevertheless, these accomplishments have been overshadowed in recent weeks by the shooting of former Rwandese General, Kayumba Nyamwasa, in South Africa. 	Kyokka ebirungi bino byonna byasaanawo mu wiiki ntono eziyise Kayumba Nyamwasa bwe yakubibwa amasasi mu South Afirika.
Also the mysterious murder of Green Party official Andre Kagwa Rwisereka, the arrest of politicians and the closure of two critical newspapers.	N'ekirala lye ttemu eryatuusibwa ku mukungu wa Green Party Andre Kagwa Rwisereka, okusiba bannabyabufuzi n'okuggalawo empapula z'amawulire ebbiri ez'amaanyi.
It was only the Social Democratic Party Permanent Secretary, Imberakuri managing to be officially recognised.	Omuwandiisi ow'enkalakalira mu kibiina kya Social Democratic Party, Imberakuri ye yekka eyakkirizibwa mu mateeka.
However, Permanent Secretary, Imberakuri later failed to compete in the election after an internal squabble.	Kyokka oluvannyuma omuwandiisi ono ow'enkalakalira, Imberakuri yalemererwa okuvuganya mu kulonda olw'ebizibu eby'omunda.
This led to a split and the ouster of its founding chairman, Bernard Ntaganda, who is in prison on charges of violence.	Kino kyaleetawo enjawukana era n'okuggyibwako kwa ssentebe waakyo eyakitandikawo, Bernard Ntaganda, kati ali mu kkomera olw'emisango egyekuusa ku bikolwa eby'obukambwe.
The Democratic Green Party led by Frank Habineza failed to get registered as did the United Democratic Forces led by Victoire Ingabire.	Ekibiina kya Democratic Green Party ekikulemberwa Frank Habineza kyalemererwa okuwandiisibwa era n'ekya United Democratic Forces ekikulemberwa Victoire Ingabire nakyo kyalemererwa.
Ingabire had controversial stances on the Rwanda Patriotic Front’s behavior in ending the genocide.	Ingabire yalina endowooza ez'enjawulo ku ngeri ekibiina kya Rwanda Patriotic Front gye kyeyisaamu nga kikomya ekitta bantu.
Her statements on the treatment of Hutus too led to criminal charges that kept her movements restricted.	Bye yayogera ku ngeri Abahutu gye baayisibwamu kyamuviirako okuvunaanibwa emisango egyekuusa ku ttemu era kino kyamuviirako okukugirwa okutambula.
It is the long established parties, such as the Social Democratic Party, led by its secretary general and deputy speaker of parliament.	Ebibiina ebyali byatandikibwawo edda gamba nga ekya Social Democratic Party ekikulemberwa ssabawandiisi waakyo n'omumyuka w'omwogezi wa palamenti.
The Liberal Party, led by Senator Higiro and the Party for Progress and Concord, led by Senator Mukabaramba Alvera, entered the race.	Waliwo n'ebibiina ebirala ebyayingira mu lwokaano gamba nga ekya Liberal Party ekikulemberwa Omubaka Higiro n'ekya Party for Progress and Concord ekikulemberwa Omubaka Mukabaramba Alvera.
Liberal Party, a party known to command a disproportionately high level of genocide survivors in its leadership. 	Kimanyiddwa nti ekibiina kya Liberal Party kikulemberwa abantu bangi nnyo abasumattuka ekittabantu.
This including Higiro himself, promised to deal with the issue of compensation for genocide victims. 	Abantu abo nga mw'otwalidde Higiro kennyini, baasuubiza nti bajja kukola ku nsonga ey'okusasulira abo bonna abaakosebwa ekitta bantu ekyo.
Social Democratic Party promised more open public debate on major policy changes.	Ekibiina kya Democratic Party kyasuubiza nti kijja kwogera nnyo ku nkyukakyuka ezirina okukolebwa ku ebyo ebiruma abantu.
Those changes have been interpreted as an appeal to those disgruntled by the shift from French to English in Rwandese society.	Enkyukakyuka ezo zitwalibwa okuba omulanga ogukubiddwa eri abo bonna abatali bamativu n'ekyo Rwanda kye yakola eky'okuva ku Lufalaansa n'edda ku Lungereza.
Inside Rwanda, the situation was not nearly as controversial or repressive as the outside media made it sound.	Mu Rwanda embeera yali terabika kuba mbi nnyo nga bwe kyali kiwulika ku mikuttu gy'ebweru egy'eby'empuliziganya.
Posters, colors and giant billboards of the dominant Rwandan Patriotic Front, were on the streets of Kigali and across the country side.	Ebipande ebinene n'ebitono awamu ne langi z'ekibiina kya Rwandan Patriotic Front byali ku nguudo zonna ez'omu Kigali n'okutuukira ddala mu byalo.
Otherwise the sort of tension that tends to characterise African elections was absent.	Wadde kyali kityo, obunkenke obutera okubawo mu biseera eby'okulonda mu Afirika tebwaliwo.
The population know that Kagame is not going anywhere soon, so confidence and support in him is widespread.	Abantu bonna bakimanyi bulungi nti Kagame talina gy'alaga mu kiseera kino, n'olwekyo obuwagizi bw'alina bwa maanyi nnyo.
On July 4, the Chief of Defence Forces, Gen Aronda received a radio message believed to be a threat.	Nga Jjulaayi 4 akulira amaggye ga Uganda Generali Aronda yafuna essimu eyamutuusaako obubaka obutiisatiisa.
Whatever little they were willing to give, they channeled to Non Government Organizations and wasteful United Nation agencies.	Ka kibe kitono kitya kye baali baagala okuwaayo, baakizza mu bibiina by'obwannakyewa ne mu bitongole ebirala eby'ekibiina ky'amawanga amagatte.

Australia’s fosters Nile Breweries parent company is considering a stake in Foster’s Group beer operations but has not decided on making a formal offer.

The Electoral Commission displayed the National Voters’ Register from 11th - 31st August 2010 at each polling station within the parish.	Akakiiko k'eby'okulonda kaattimba enkalala z'abalonzi okuva nga 11 okutuuka nga 31 Agusito 2010 mu buli kifo ku muluka we bannaakubira akalulu.
In preparation for the General Elections 2011 as mandated under section twenty five of the Electoral Commission act (Cap One hundred and forty) the Uganda Electoral Commision displayed the register.	Mu kuteekateeka okulonda okwa 2011 nga bwe kirambikiddwa obulungi mu kitundu ekya kikumi mu abiri mu bitaano mu mateeka agafuga Akakiiko Akakola ku by'Okulonda, Akakiiko akakola ku by'okulanda mu Uganda kaattimba enkalala.
A clean voters’ register is the cornerstone for free and fair elections.	Enkalala ezikoleddwa obulungi nga teziriimu nsobi ze ziraga nti wajja kubaawo okulonda okw'amazima n'obwenkanya.
He first belittled the post of Secretary General as “small” but later contested for it claiming he wanted to strengthen the party.	"Yasooka kubuusa maaso ekifo ky'okuba Ssabawandiisi ng'akitwala okuba ""ekitono"" naye oluvannyuma yakivuganyaako ng'agamba nti yayagala kunyweza kibiina."
Check for correspondences of your particulars on the Voters Register and report the dead, non citizen, under age, to the Officer, if they appear on the Voters’ Register.	Mu nkalala keeberamu ebyo ebikukwatako, era abo abaafa, abatali batuuze, abatannatuuka kulonda boogereyo eri omukulu akubiriza eby'okulonda singa bibaamu.
The disorganised primaries worsened the problem.	Enteekateeka etaali nnuŋŋamu ekwata ku kusunsulibwa ye yasajjula ekizibu.
Some of the losers have since declared that they will contest as independents.	Okuva olwo abamu ku abo abataayitamu baagamba nti bajja kwesimbawo bwannamunigina.
Others are weighing their options.	Abalala bakyerowooza.
The two constituencies, therefore, had a combined total of seventy six thousand and fifty seven votes cast.	N'olwekyo, konsituwensi zombi ng'ozigasse wamu obululu obwakubibwa bwali emitwalo nsanvu mu mukaaga mu ataano mu musanvu.
One would expect that the total number of votes cast for both the candidate for the district Chairman’s slot and the district woman Member of Parliament’s slot would come to that seventy six thousand and fifty seven, but that has not been the case.	Omuntu yandikisuubidde nti obululu bwonna obwakubibwa okulonda bassentebe ba disitulikiti n'ababaka ba palamenti abakazi mu disitulikiti bwe bwandibadde emitwalo egyo ensanvu mu mukaaga mu ataano mu musanvu, naye bwe kityo si bwe kibadde.
How come the votes cast for the Woman Member of Parliament and the Local Council five Chairman were in excess of those cast for those who contested for the Member of Parliament’s slots?	Kijja kitya okuba nti obululu obwakubibwa okulonda omubaka wa palamenti omukazi ne bassentebe ba LC 5 bwali bungi okusinga obwo obwa ababaka ba palamenti?
Besides, barring party members from contesting as independents would be a violation of the constitution.	Ng'oggyeko ekyo, okukugira bamemba b'ekibiina okwesimbawo ku bwannamunigina kyandibadde kityobola ssemateeka.
Any move against the independents can only lead to unnecessary litigation, from which the party would emerge more scathed.	Omuntu yenna alemesa abo abeesimbyewo ku bwannamunigina ayinza okukubibwa mu mbuga z'amateeka era nga kino kiyinza okuba eky'akabi eri ekibiina.
He is either bluffing or running a big risk, if he is not.	Awo aba asaaga busaazi oba aba yeetadde mu buzibu.
His situation was understandable.	Embeera ye yali tetebenkedde.
Sources close to Bukenya had told The Independent late in August that the president had made a substantial financial contribution towards his campaign.	Ku nkomerero y'omwezi gwa Agusito, abo abali okumpi ne Bukenya baali bategezezza olupapula lw'amawulire olwa Independenti nti pulezidenti yali awaddeyo ssente nnyingi nnyo okumuwagira mu kampeyini.
This did not happen.	Naye ekyo si bwe kyali.
The Vice President is meant to be the most powerful man after the president, but once he starts getting zeros in some districts, then you know his political rating is really down.	Omumyuka wa pulezidenti alina okuba nga y'addirira pulezidenti mu kuba n'amaanyi naye bw'atandika okuba nga mu disitulikiti ezimu tafunayo kalulu, awo omanya nti ali wansi nnyo mu by'obufuzi.
This, the insiders say, portrayed his as a politically hungry person.	Ab'omunda bagamba nti kino kimwoleka okuba omuntu alumwa enjala mu by'obufuzi.
The purpose of the display exercise was to enable the general public to inspect the voters register for accuracy and completeness.	Ekigendererwa ky'okuttimba enkalala kwali kusobozesa bantu kuzikebera balabe nga ntuufu era nga tewali kizibulamu.
It is very unfortunate that our democratic principles have been brought under examination.	Kya nnaku nnyo okulaba nti omusingi gwaffe ogwesigamiddwa ku demokulasiya gwolekaganye n'ekigezo.
It is unfortunate that our leaders are being found with ballots, cheating, ballot papers found on the streets.	Kya nnuku nnyo okulaba nti abakulembeze baffe basangibwa n'obululu, babba, era nga n'obululu busangibwa ku nguudo.
But his camp was fear.	Naye waaliwo okutya mu bantu be.
So he campaigned under ground and the results showed this.	N'olwekyo yakuba kampeyini mu mankwettu era n'ebyavaamu tebyali birungi.
Most of the petitioners are threatening to stand as independents if their complaints are not resolved.	Abangi ku abo abaawaaba omusango bagamba nti bajja kwesimbawo ku bwabwe singa okwemmulugunya kwabwe tekukolwako.
This is likely to increase the number of independents in parliament.	Kirabika kino kijja kwongera ku bungi bw'abo abeesimbawo bokka mu palamenti.
The campaigns were stiff but there were no opposition generated.	Kampeyini yali ya kaasammeeme naye nga tewaliwo ludda luvuganya.
The exercise has built democracy and debate in the party.	Kino kireeseewo demokulasiya n'okukubaganya ebirowoozo mu kibiina.
He says all the party needs is to ensure an effective mediation mechanism for those contesting the election results.	Yagamba nti ekibiina bye kyagala kwe kuba n'omutabaganya omulungi eri abo ababa bawakanya ebivudde mu kulonda.
Instead he says he plans to run as an independent.	Mu kifo ky'ekyo agamba nti ateekateeka kwesimbawo ku lulwe.
“I am loyal to the party, but not to the chaos,” he says.	Agamba nti mpagira kibiina so si buvuyo.
I appeal to competitors who did not win in primaries, not to think of running as independents.	Nkubiriza abo abataayitamu mu kakuŋŋunta obutalowooza ku kya kwesimbawo ku bwabwe.
He said fresh elections will be held where grounds are considered strong and adjustments will be made where grounds are weak.	Yagamba nti akalulu kajja kuddibwamu we balaba nti ddala kisaanidde  ate enkyukakyuka zijja kukolebwa gye balowooza nti tekisaanidde.
Other delegates who were lucky to have secured approval earlier were already attending the conference.	Abakiise abalala abaali basobodde okukkirizibwa nga bukyali baali baatuuse dda ku lukuŋŋaana.
The returning officer also wants to steal, the problem is attitude, he added.	Yagattako nti ekizibu kiri ku ndowooza kubanga n'oyo akubiriza eby'okulonda naye ayagala kubba.
They were responsible for the mess in the primaries.	Be baali bavunaanyizibwa olw'obuvuyo obwali mu kulonda okw'okusunsulamu.
It has been a learning point for organising future elections.	Tufunye eky'okuyiga ku ngeri okulonda okuliddawo gye kulitegekebwamu.
That there is complete healing of the mistakes witnessed in the elections.	Nti ensobi ezaakolebwa mu kulonda zitandise okugwerawo ddala.
And make recommendations that will leave the party united.	Era mwogere ku bintu ebitaayabuluzeemu kibiina.
Its Electoral Commission leadership and membership is to be reconstituted “very soon”.	"Abakulembeze mu kakiiko kaakyo akakola ku by'okulonda awamu ne bamemba byonna bijja kudaabululwa ""mu bwangu ddala""."
If the primaries were stolen bring facts and these people will cancel results.	Bwe kiba nti waaliwo okubbira mu kulonda kuno okw'okusunsulibwamu, muleete obukakafu era ebyavaamu bijja kusazibwamu.
The party cannot be centred only in the Kampala.	Ekibiina tekiyinza kubeera mu Kampala mwokka.
You have the same person working on delegation cards, the same person handling transport, and the Delegates. 	Omuntu omu nga y'akola ku kaadi eziweebwa abakiise, era y'omuoyo akola ku by'entambula era nga y'ayaniriza n'abagenyi.
Same person ensuring that you are registered.	Omuntu y'omu nga y'alina okukakasa nti owandiisiddwa.
Literally they were in charge of the conference.	Be baali balina obuvunaanyizibwa ku lukuŋŋaana lwonna.
He has the money and was literally in charge of everything at the conference ranging from organisation to determining who accesses the venue.	Alina ssente era n'olw'ekyo ye yali avunaanyizibwa ku buli kimu ku lukuŋŋaana olwo okuviira ddala ku kutegeka n'okusalawo ani akkirizibwa okujja mu lukuŋŋaana olwo.
The organisers of the conference argued that they were overwhelmed by the number of delegates.	Abaateekateeka olukuŋŋaana olwo baagamba nti baatendewalirwa olw'obungi bw'abakiise.
They were also of no known political power.	Era nga tebamanyi buyinza ki bwe balina mu bya bufuzi.
Nobody was sure who would win the presidency.	Tewali n'omu eyali akakasa ani anaawangula ekifo ky'obwa pulezidenti.
The only competition was in the lower positions especially the Secretary General.	Okuvuganya kwali mu bifo ebya wansi byokka nnaddala ku kifo kya Ssabawandiisi.
You can aspire for other positions in the party, but not the presidency.	Osobola okuluubirira ekifo ekirala kyonna mu kibiina naye nga si kya bwa pulezidenti.
He instead said it shows the need for people to change attitude about time keeping and respecting electoral rules,” he said defiantly.	"Ng'oggyeko ekyo yagamba nti kino kiraga nti waliwo obwetaavu abantu okukyusa endowooza yaabwe ku nsonga y'okukwata ebiseera n'okussa ekitiibwa ku mateeka agafuga eby'okulonda,"" kino yakyogera ng'alaga nti yeetamiddwa."
People were still campaigning while time for voting had started until I shouted.	Abantu baali bakyakuba kampeyini ng'ate ekiseera eky'okulonda kituuse, awo nnendyoka nkangula ku ddoboozi.
The problem is that people have not internalised the struggle of democracy, the printer, transporter of the ballot wants.	Ekizibu kiri nti abantu tebannategeerera ddala nti kyetaagisa okufuba kwa maanyi okusobola okuleetawo demokulasiya n'ebirala ebyetaagisa.
He said they recorded names of their supporters leaving out others who did not support them.	Yagamba nti baawandiika amaanya g'abawagizi baabwe ne baleka ag'abo abatabawagira.
His partly attributed the mess to meager.	Ekibiina kye kyagamba nti okuba n'eby'okukozesa ebitono kye kyaviirako obuvuyo obwo.
He said they recorded names of their supporters leaving out others who did not support them.	Yagamba nti baawandiika amaanya g'abawagizi baabwe ne baleka ag'abo abatabawagira.
He won resources.	Yafuna ebyetaagisa.
The intense fight among the party officials suggests the thirst for power rather than to serve the country.	Okulwanagana okw'amaanyi okwali mu bakungu b'ekibiina kulaga nti balina nnyonta ya kufuna buyinza so si kuweereza bantu.
We are going to vote in a few hours but we do not know which delegate with which card will be allowed to vote.	Ebulayo essaawa ntono tulonde naye tetumanyi mukiise ki era ng'alina kaadi ki anaakkirizibwa okulonda.
The genuine delegates have been denied entry into this venue and non delegates have been allowed in.	Abakiise abatuufu balemeseddwa okuyingira mu kifo kino era abo abatali bakiise be bakkiriziddwa okuyingira.
The candidates have been denied access to the voters' register.	Abeesimbyewo balemeseddwa okulaba enkalala z'abalonzi.
It is unfair that one of the candidates is involved in the organisation of the election process.	Si kya bwenkanya okulaba nti omu ku abo abeesimbyewo ate y'omu ku bategesi b'okulonda.
He grumbled as he waved a sample of two different accreditation cards.	Yeemulugunya ng'eno bw'ayolesa kaadi ez'emirundi ebiri ezikkirizibwa.
Tension took over the audience.	Waaliwo obunkenke mu abo abaaliwo.
The presidential guards rushed to make a security ring around the President.	Abakuumi ba pulezidenti baayanguwa mangu ne bassaawo obukuumi okumwetooloola.
Everyone watched in wonder and anxiety.	Buli omu yatunuulira ebyali bigenda mu maaso era ne yeewuunya.
The audience fell silent.	Tewaaliwo kanyego mu bantu abaaliwo.
You could hear a pin drop.	Wali osobola n'okuwulira akayiso akagudde wansi.
He asked the party electoral commission to explain.	Yasaba akakiiko k'ekibiina ak'eby'okulonda kannyonnyole.
He said delegates were receiving varying amounts of allowances depending on the distance from their districts.	Yagamba nti abakiise baali bafuna ensako za njawulo okusinziira ku buwanvu bw'olugendo gye baali bava.
Each district had one hundred delegates.	Buli disitulikiti yalina abakiise kikumi.
Each district had a polling station.	Buli disitulikiti yalina w'ekubira akalulu.
The old party leadership was returned save for the posts of National Party Treasurer.	Obukulembeze bw'ekibiina obw'edda bwakomezebwawo nnaddala obwo obw'omuwanika w'ekibiina.
Therefore, they could not dare throw out his man.	N'olwekyo bali tebayinza kwetantala kufulumya musajja we.
He had an additional advantage over his rivals.	Alina bye yali asingako ku banne abalala abaali beesimbyewo naye.
This gave him more time than his opponents to market his candidature.	Kino  kyamusobozesa okuba n'ebiseera bingi okwennyonnyolako okusinga banne.
The delegates kept chorusing “abewo!”.	"Abakiise baagenda mu maaso nga boogera nti ""abeewo!"""
He spoke on the first day of the conference and he kept reminding delegates of his name and candidature.	Yayogera ku lunaku olwasooka olw'olukuŋŋaana era buli lunaku yabajjukizanga erinnya lye era n'abategeza nga bwe yeesimbyewo.
Strategically it was these regions that had the swing vote and a candidate who would win them would be the Secretary General.	Ebitundu bino bye byali bisinga okubaamu abalonzi era ne ku abo abeesimbyewo eyandiwangudde yandibadde Ssabawandiisi.
He did and was given the cash.	Yakola era yaweebwa ssente.
The other camps were also giving out money to delegates to vote for their preferred candidates.	Abaali mu bubondo obulala nabo baali bagabira abakiise ssente basobole okulonda abo be baagala.
Probably the difference was who had more money and power.	Oboolyawo enjawulo yali ku ani asinza ssente n'obuyinza.
He was appearing to be an insubordinate candidate who has no respect for party decisions.	Yali alabika ng'omujeemu era atassa kitiibwa ku ebyo ekibiina bye kiba kisazeewo.
How could such people be entrusted with a top party office?	Abantu ng'abo bayinza batya okulondebwa mu bifo ebya waggulu mu kibiina?
“Nobody can disobey the Central Executive Committee, that is a dream.	"Kiba kirooto bulooto ""omuntu yenna okujeemera Akakiiko ak'Oku Ntikko."
It cannot be any single moment.	Ekyo tekisobola kubaawo n'omulundi n'ogumu.
Central Executive Committee sat and passed through these names.	Akakiiko ak'Oku Ntikko kaatuula ne kayitayita mu mannya ago gonna.
Others were removed for various reasons.	Agamu gaagibwamu olw'ensonga ezitali zimu.
I do not work alone.	Nze sikola nzekka.
Yet at this time, voting was still going on in all polling stations.	Kyokka mu kiseera kino okulonda kwali kukyagenda mu maaso mu bifo ebironderwamu byonna.
These text messages swung the voters’ mood.	Abalonzi baawerezebwanga obubaka era bulina engeri gye bwa batabulangamu.
It would be futile to vote a losing candidate.	Kyandibadde kya kabi nnyo okulonda omuntu agenda okuwangulwa.
It cannot be mathematically established that voters changed their mind because of this.	Tekikkirizika nti kino kyakyusa endowooza y'abalonzi.
Usually voters do not want to vote a losing candidate.	Bulijjo abalonzi tebaagala kulonda oyo agenda okuwangulwa.
His daughter was in charge of accreditation and managing data of delegates.	Muwala we ye yali avunaanyizibwa ku by'okukakasa n'okukola ku ebyo ebikwata ku bakiise.
He talked amidst the wild applause from the delegates.	Yayogerera mu abo abaali bakuba obuluulu.
He was figuring out what to do with his fighting strongmen and whether he should support one against the other.	Yali alowooza ku ky'okukolera basajja be ab'amaanyi abaali balwanagana era nga yeebuuza oba abeeko omu ku bo gw'awagira.
After falling out with the unions, one of his main support bases, the soft-spoken man with a vibrant and infectious personality and dance moves to boot.	Oluvannyuma lw'okulemagana n'ebibiina, omu ku abo abasingirayo ddala okumuwagira era nga ye musajja ayogeza esimbo era alina engeri endala ezisikiriza, yatandika okukyakyankya.
But that reputation is rapidly being eroded by a president criticised as indecisive on the country’s main problems.	Naye erinnya eryo eddungi ligenda lisaanyizibwawo puleziddenti ayogerwako ng'atasalawo ku bizibu eby'amaanyi ebiri mu ggwanga.
We have nothing to celebrate.	Tewali nsonga lwaki tujjaganya.
We lost more than one point one million jobs.	Tufiiriddwa emirimu egisukka mu kakadde kamu mu emitwalo kkumi.
As a result, five point five million South Africans have been pushed into poverty.	Ekigenda okuva mu kino, abantu b'omu South Afirika abasukka mu bukadde butaano mu emitwalo ataano bagenda kuba baavu.
With some one million public sector workers about to enter their third week on strike and as Cosatu threatened to bring the entire economy to a standstill by calling other sectors to join the stoppage.	Abakozi kumpi akadde kamu banaatera okuyingira wiiki ey'okusatu nga beedimmye, kyokka ekibiina kya Cosatu kitiisizza okuyimiriza abakozi bonna kireete abalala bagikole.
Public workers want an eight point six percent wage increase, while the government has been standing firm on its offer of seven percent.	Abakozi baagala okwongezebwa omusaala gwa bitundu 8.6, kyokabaka nga yo gavumenti ebadde ekyanyweredde ku bitundu musaanvu.
If he chooses one side, then he loses the other.	Bw'anaabaako oludda lw'awagira ajja kubaako lw'afiirwa.
The strike has had a crippling effect on schools and hospitals, leaving health facilities having to function with skeleton staff, military aid and ordinary South Africans.	Okwekalakasa kulina kya maanyi kye kukoze ku masomero n'amalwaliro era ng'abantu aba bulijjo n'abasirikale be baddukanya amalwaliro.
This further alienated his supporters.	Kino kyayongera kumalamu maanyi bawigizi be.
Some believe his handling of the strike has deeply damaged the ruling's long standing alliance with the left.	Abamu bagamba nti engeri gye yakwatamu abeekalakaasi erina engeri gye yakosaamu enkolagana ye n'abagabirizi b'obuyambi.
Meeting the demands of his union and left wing backers would have alarmed the markets and the business community.	Okutuukiriza obukwakulizo bw'ekibiina kye era n'obw'abagabirizi b'obuyambi kyandiwaawaazizza amatu mu butale ne mu basuubuzi.
And in terms of alleviating poverty, his ministers have argued that raising pay for those with jobs would mean less money to potentially create work.	Ate mu ngeri y'okuggyawo obwavu baminisita be bagamba nti okwongeza omusaala gw'abo abalina emirimu kijja kumalawo ssente ez'okutondawo emirimu.
Some analysts say his biggest challenge is his need to appease the conflicting interests in the broad alliance which propelled him to power.	Abamu ku beekenenya bagamba nti ekizibu eky'amaanyi ky'alina kwe kusanyusa enjuuyi zombi ezaamusobozesa okujja mu buyinza.
The challenge I am facing is that of balancing family and work.	Okusoomoza okw'amaanyi kwe nnina kwe kukola ku by'awaka ne by'omulimu.
I am serving on several boards of schools.	Ndi ku bukiiko bungi obw'amasomero.
The most obvious impact is that of opening up markets and therefore making it easy for us to open branches in the member countries.	Ekintu ekisinga obukulu kwe kuggulawo obutale era n'okutwanguyiza okuggulawo amatabi mu nsi ze tukolagana nazo.
The common market, I hope,will bring a wider market for our products and services	Nsuubira nti akatale kano ak'awamu kajja kutusobozesa okuba n'akatale akagazi gye tusobola okutunda ebintu byaffe.
The future for this business is very bright only that those that fail to style up will be forced to close.	Ebiseera by'omu maaso ebya buzineesi eno birungi kyokka abo abaanaalemererwa okutuukagana n'omutindo bajja kuwalirizibwa okuggalawo.
Those are our secrets for now which we can’t tell everyone.	Ebyo bye byama bye tulina mu kiseera kino bye tutayinza kubuulira buli muntu yenna.
I personally believe in systems and control and this has a lot to do with my background in banking, especially in audit where I spent a while.	Nze nzikkiririza mu nkola ennuŋŋaamu era kino kikwatagana bulungi n'emirimu gyange egya banka, nnaddala ogw'eby'embalirira gwe nkoze okumala ekiseera.
Upgrading the core banking application to a more robust platform that will enable them serve customers better and act as a launch pad for more innovative solutions.	Okusitula omutindo gwa banka kijja kubasobozesa okuweereza abantu obulungi era n'okumanya ebirala ebisingayo obulungi bye basaanidde okukola.
Which will be given to the company at between thirteen and fifteen per cent interest which is below the bank rates.	Zijja kuweebwa kampuni ku magoba agali wakati w'ebitundu kkumi na bisatu ne kkumi na bitaano ku buli kikumi era nga bino biri wansi w'omutemwa gwa banka.
Move faster to implement a national insurance health plan and take firm action against corrupt individuals who use the government for personal enrichment.	Mwanguwe okussa mu nkola enteekateeka ya yinsuwa y'obulamu era mukole ku bali b'enguzi abeeyambisa gavumenti okwegaggawaza.
Nationalise the country’s mines,speed up the redistribution of white owned land to the black majority and transfer more business into black ownership.	Ebirombe mubifuule bya ggwanga lyonna, mwanguye okugabanya bakaddugala abasinga obungi ettaka lya bakyeruppe era buzineesi ezisinga obungi muziwe bakaddugala.
You are saying that it will remain the same as during the colonial regime.	Ogamba nti bijja kusigala bye bimu nga bwe kyali mu biseera by'obufuzi bw'amatwale.
Some union members chanted during nationwide marches last week.	Bamemba b'ekibiina abamu baayimba wiiki ewedde mu kutambula okwaliwo mu ggwanga lyonna.
Uganda Nile Breweries' Operations operations could be worth more than ten billion dollars.	Ebyo Uganda Nile Breweries by'ekola biyinza okuba nga bibalirwamu obuwumbi bwa ddola obusukka mu kkumi.
The merger will not affect the existing management, staff and the services rendered by the two companies.	Okukolera awamu tekujja kukosa nkola y'emirimu eriwo mu kiseera kino, abakozi n'emirimu eginaakolebwa kampuni zombi.
The Chief Executive Officers of both companies will lead a transition team, which will develop a specific integration plan.	Abakulu ab'oku ntikko aba kampuni zombi be bajja okukulemberamu abo anaakola enkyukakyuka eno era bajja kukola enteekateeka ennuŋŋamu.
The French made  Regional Transport Airplanes aircraft has a capacity of 48 passengers.	Ennyonyi ze tulina ezaakolebwa mu Bufalaansa zisobola okutwala abantu 48.
Like other aircraft in the fleet, it will feature inflight entertainment that allows passengers to watch movies and listen to music inflight.	Okufaananako nga bwe kiri mu nnyonyi endala, abasabaze bajja kuba nga basobola okwesanyusaamu nga balaba emizannyo era nga buwuliriza n'ennyimba.
How are you resolving these challenges?	Obuzibu obwo ogenda kubusonjola otya?
However I am prioritising and delegating wherever possible.	Nkulembeza ebisinga obukulu ate ebirala ne mbikwasa abalala bwe kiba kisoboka.
But this also has challenges, in that we must be prepared to face very stiff competition.	Naye na kino kirimu obuzibu obulala. Tulina okuba abeetegefu okwaŋŋaanga okuvuganya okw'amaanyi.
The free flow of labour will also avail us skills that were hitherto scarce in our own individual countries.	Okufuna abakozi okuva mu bitundu ebirala kijja kutusobozesa okufuna obumanyirivu bwe tutabadde nabwo mu nsi zaffe.
The competition will improve efficiency, which is good for customers.	Okuvuganya kujja kutuleetera okukola obulungi emirimu era kino kijja kuba kya muganyulo nnyo eri abo be tuweereza.
What new innovations are coming up at the forex bureau?	Bippya ki ebigenda okuleetebwa ku mulimu gw'okuvungisa ssente?
But certainly we have new innovations up.	Naye ekituufu kiri nti tulina ebippya ebijja.
What is your style to successful management and who are your mentors?	Odduukanya otya emirimu gyo era baani abakuwa amagezi?
Unfortunately I don’t have a particular mentor, because I have been mentored by several people in the different trades.	Eky'ennaku sirina muntu omu gwe nnyinza okugamba nti y'ampa amagezi kubanga mpeereddwa amagezi abantu abatali bamu mu mirimu egy'enjawulo.
He taught me how to use my brain a little better and that totally changed my life.	Yanjigiriza engeri y'okukozesaamu obwongo bwange mu ngeri esingayo obulungi era ekyo kyakyusa obulamu bwange.
This strong growth was driven by increased customer deposits and customer lending,prudent cost management and better portfolio management.	Okukulaakulana kuvudde mu kuba ne bakasitoma abampola era be nnewolako, okukkekkereza n'engeri ennungi ey'okuddukanyaamu emirimu.
In spite of the pressure on the net interest margins, we are on track for yet another good year.	Wadde tufuba nnyo okulaba nti tufuna amagoba, tusuubira nti n'omwaka ogujja tujja kukola.
During the period under review, the bank remained steadfast in implementing its investment plans of expanding the delivery channel mix.	Mu kiseera ekyo ekyali kyogerwako, bbanka yasigala nga nywevu mu kussa mu nkola enteekateeka zaayo ezikwata ku kutumbula busineesi.
The new brick and tile factory cost thirty six billion in equity and loans.	Ekkolero eppya ery'amatoofaali ne tayilo lyatwala obuwumbi asatu mu mukaaga.
What challenges are you facing?	Kusoomoozibwa ki kw'oyolekaganye nakwo?
I have taken on a lot of responsibilities, and yet I still have a young family to take care of.	Nnina obuvunaanyizibwa bungi nnyo ate nkyalina abaana abato bendabirira.
In addition to my several business interests, I also serve my church in various capacities.	Ng'oggyeko buzineesi nnyingi ze nnina, mpeereza ne mu kkanisa yange mu bifo ebitali bimu.
I must physically visit the over one fifty clubs that exist in these countries in the course of the year.	Mu mwaka nnina okukyalira ebibiina ebisukka mu amakumi attaano mu ggwanga lino.
I have to do all this in six days of the week because Sundays are for my family and my mother whom I must visit whenever I am around.	Bino byonna nnina okubikolera mu nnaku mukaaga mu wiiki kubanga ku Sande mbeera wamu n'ab'omu maka gange era nkyalira ne maama wange.
Do you consider yourself an overachiever?	Weetwala okuba omuntu alina ebingi by'akoze?
This would not work if the people I am leading and supporting through different institutions were not hard working.	Bwe kityo si bwe kyandibadde singa abantu be nkulembera era n'abo be nnyamba tebaba bazibu.
This would not work if the people I am leading and supporting through different institutions were not hard working.	Bwe kityo si bwe kyandibadde singa abantu be nkulembera era n'abo be nnyamba tebaba bazibu.
This was giving us a very bad name for sure.	Mu butuufu kino kibadde kituwa erinnya ebbi.
I think after he served a sentence or something.	Ndowooza oluvannyuma ng'amazeeko ekiseera kye eky'obusibe.
Have you arrested the people who killed this politician?	Mwakwata abantu abatta munnabyabufuzi ono?
That is a different issue now.	Eyo nsonga ya njawulo kati.
There are parties that were registered but did not front a candidate.	Waliwo ebibiina ebyewandiisa naye nga tebyasimbawo muntu yenna.
I will not suggest it is all of them,  there are sections of the international press.	Sijja kugamba nti bonna, ekitundu kya bannamawulire ab'ensi yonna.
Whenever they are violent and they are killing each other, we must go and pacify them.	Buli lwe booleka ebikolwa eby'obukambwe era nga battiŋŋaana, tulina okugendayo okuzzaawo emirembe.
"Do you sometimes have doubt and say,"" wow, possibly people are afraid and that is why they are showing up at these rallies?"""	"Oluusi oyinza okubeera awo n'otandika okubuusabuusa ng'ogamba nti, ""oboolyawo abantu balina okutya era ng'eyo ye nsonga lwaki bajja mu bungi mu nkuŋŋaana zino?"""
One would be making a very serious mistake to ignore the level of maturity that has been reached in the process by our people.	Omuntu yandibadde akoze ensobi ya maanyi nnyo okubuusa amaaso endowooza y'ekikulu abantu baffe gye balina mu kiseera kino.
You see leadership is very important in everything.	Okimanyi bulungi nti obulembeze kintu kikulu nnyo mu buli kintu.
You can get even a hundred percent of the votes, but a hundred percent of what?	Osobola n'okufuna kikumi ku kikumi eky'obululu, naye nga kikumi ku kikumi ekya ki?
It should be, I guess, about ninety six to ninety seven percent.	Nze ndowooza kirina kuba kyenda mu mukaaga oba kyenda mu musanvu ku buli kikumi.
The title of superman seems to confirm everything.	Ekitiibwa eky'okuba omununuzi kikakasa bulungi ensonga eno.
No, in fact, I should not be overpraised.	Nedda, sisaanidde kutenderezebwa kisukkiridde.
I have really never doubted my people and more so in the recent days.	Sibuusabuusangako bantu bange nnaddala ennaku zino.
We have explained it to the media.	Kino tukinnyonnyola ku mikutu gy'eby'empuliziganya.
So why do you think the international press remains negative?	Kati olowooza kiki ekiviirako bannamawulire okuva mu nsi yonna okukwogerako obubi?
I think there is a much deeper problem than this.	Nze nsuubira waliwo ekizibu eky'amaanyi okusinga ku kino.
In their view nothing good is happening here, nothing good should be happening here.	Bo balowooza nti tewali kirungi kiri wano, era nti tewali kirungi kirina kuba wano.
So there is this whole thing about image, perception and bias.	Kati bino byonna bikwata ku kifaananyi, endowooza, n'okwekuubira.
That is why we are here as you see us, forget the names they call us.	Eyo ye nsonga lwaki tuli nga bw'otulaba, weerabire amannya ge batuyita.
We are determined to shape our future, decide for ourselves, fight for our dignity, for selfdetermination and there is no question about it.	Tuli bamalirivu okutereeza ebiseera byaffe eby'omu maaso, okwesalirawo, okulwanirira ekitiibwa kyaffe, okubeera abamalirivu era ekyo tekibuusibwabuusibwa.
I followed you on many campaign rallies and I saw huge crowds.	Nnakugoberera ku kampeyini zo nnyingi era wabanga n'abantu bangi
I know the expressions they make out there are genuine, are honest and I think anybody is mistaken to underrate that.	Mmanyi nti abantu bye boogera eyo bituufu naye abamu bayinza okulowooza nti byabulimba
What do you think could have caused that?	olowooza ekyo kyaava ku ki?
Leaders led our people to kill each other, to have genocide in this country that took a million lives of our people.	Abakulembeze baleetera abantu okuttiŋŋana, ensi yaffe n'ebeeramu ekittabantu ekyattirimbula obukadde n'obukadde bw'abantu
We have seen it work over the years and these are the results.	Kikoze okumala ebbanga ddene era bino bye bivuddemu
You are talking about the turnout or the votes?	Oyogera ku bantu abajja okulonda oba abalonda?
What is the turnout?	Bantu bameka abajja okulonda?
There are things you can’t do and achieve unless people are imagining that I am a superman.	Waliwo ebintu bingi ebitasoboka mu bulamu okuggyako ng'abantu balowooza nti ndi wanjawulo
You could have people on the rally who have been brought at gunpoint and forced into being there, herded there and guarded there.	Osobola okukozesa eryannyi okukaka abantu okubaawo ku nkuŋŋaana z'eby'obufuzi
Whether you would also force them to be even happy on their faces and they jubilate and even when they are going back home they go singing, they go running and the next day they come the earliest time to vote, you cannot achieve that.	Naye okukaka abantu okulaga essanyu, bajaganye, baddeyo ekka nga badduka bayimbira waggulu olw'essanyu era nti enkeera babukeereze nkokola balonde, ekyo kiba kizibu okukituukiriza
You know you have achieved many things.	Okimanyi bulungi nti waliwo bingi by'okoze
That is true.	Era ng'ekyo kituufu
So what would stop you from mobilising people through intimidation and fear to come to your rallies?	Kati olwo kiki ekyandabadde kikulemesa okukunga abantu okujja ku nkuŋŋaana zo ez'eby'obufuzi ng'oyita mu kubatiisatiisa?
I think if that is the way it is, people should respect it for so long as it works for the people of the country and they are happy with it.	Nze ndowooza bwe kiba kikola, abantu bajja kukimanyiira
Even if they don’t respect me, they should respect the fact that I am superman.	Ne bwe kiba nti tebanjagala, balina okukikkiriza nti ndi w'amaanyi
This has been made known to everybody because we all were concerned and worried.	Kino ffenna twakimanya era kyatweraliikiriza
This socalled journalist had actually earlier on been charged with genocide.	Munnamawulire ono yavunaanibwako omusango gwa kittabantu
He had been prosecuted in the courts of law as a genocidaire but later on he was released.	Yatwalibwako mu mbuga z'amateeka ng'avunaanibwa omusango ogwekuusa ku kittabantu naye n'ajjeerezebwa
I didn’t even know he was ever a journalist.	Ssaakimanyaako nti yaliko munnamawulire
All these facts are out there in the public but journalists choose to ignore them because they want to keep the story that the journalist was killed by government,that this was to do with repression and it was to do with elections.	Ebifa ku musajja oyo abantu bangi babimanyi naye bannamawulire tebaagala kubyogerako kubanga baagala okulowoozesa abantu nti gavumenti yamutta olw'ensonga ez'eby'okulonda
It had nothing to do with election.	Naye tebyali bya kulonda
The confession is just forged.	Ebyo babigweteka bugwetesi
This time they will have evidence and facts to support their suspicion.	Ku luno abantu bajja kuleeta obujulizi obulaga nti ebyo bannamawulire bye boogera bya bulimba
They can keep checking on him in jail to see whether he will be secretly released.	Bajja kumulambulanga mu kkomera okutuusa lwe balimuta mu kyama
Let’s now come to the politician who was killed.	Kati katwogere ku munnabyabufuzi eyattibwa
The blogs, the international media and the human rights groups are saying that he was a very strong politician.	Bannamawulire abawano n'ab'ebweru n'abalwannirizi b'eddembe ery'obuntu bagamba nti yali munnabyabufuzi wa ttutumu
First of all the government refused to register his party, which was very strong, because you feared his party would defeat the Rwanda Political Front in the elections.	Gavumenti yagaana okuwandiisa ekibiina kye eky'eby'obufuzi ekyali eky'amaanyi ennyo, kubanga baatya nti mu kulonda akalulu kisobola okuwangula ekya Rwanda Political Front
First of all, there are lots of distortions and there is no truth at all in that.	Waliwo bingi ebyogerwa naye nga byonna si bituufu
I have no issue with that one.	Nange sirina kye mmanyi
He actually owned a bar, which was more known than the man himself.	Yalina ebbaala era abantu baali bagimanyi bulungi kyokka nga tebamanyi nnyo nnannyini yo
Secondly I didn’t know this man, I had never heard of him until I heard of his death.	Nnali simanyi musajja oyo, naye nawulira buwulizi nti afudde
The press have suggested that he was a strong and influential politician whom you were afraid of.	Bannamawulire bagamba nti yali munnabyabufuzi wa maanyi nnyo era ng'atiika
Absolutely not!	Naye ekyo si kituufu
I am telling you he was not known to me and he was not known to many.	Nnali simumanyi era n'abalala bangi baali tebamumanyi
If you ask people around, many people had never heard of him.	Ne bw'obuuza abantu, bajja kugamba nti tebamuwulirangako
This fellow was an unknown entity.	Omusajja eyo tamanyiddwa.
How could I have been afraid of him to the point of killing him?	Kati olwo lwaki nnandimutidde nnyo ne ntuuka n'okumutta?
The police is under pressure to investigate to get to the bottom of the matter.	Kati police ekola butaweera okumunoonyerezaako
This is why I am saying some journalists put together all sorts of things that are unrelated but have happened randomly due for different reasons and just create a story even if these things are not related.	Nkizudde nti bannamawulire abamu bamanyi okugunjaawo ebiboozi boozi ebitali bituufu nga balina ebigendererwa ebyabwe ku bwabwe.
There are many events that happened in the runup to the election that seem related.	Waliwo ebintu bingi ebyaliwo mu kiseera kye kimu ng'okulonda kunaatera okubaawo.
For example, this politician who was killed, it coincides with denying his party registration.	Okugeza, ekiseera munnabyabuzi oyo kyafiiramu kikwatagana n'ekiseera we bagaanira okuwandiisa ekibiina kye eky'eby'obufuzi
Why?	Lwaki?
There are parties that wanted to front candidates but did not qualify or did not go through the normal procedures.	Waliwo ebibiina by'obufuzi ebyasimbawo abantu baabyo naye ne bitatuukiriza bisaanyizo olw'okulemererwa okugoberera emitendera
There are two things, the party qualifies through a process and the party leader or the would be presidential candidate also has to qualify through another process.	Waliwo ebintu bibiri, ekibiina ky'eby'obufuzi n'omukulembeze waakyo bisunsulwa bulala, n'oyo ey'esimbyewo ku ntebbe y'obukulembeze bw'eggwanga asansulwa mu ngeri ndala
This is how parties get registered here, you get two hundred supporters, they get together, they form a general assembly, they declare their intention of forming a party, they call a Notary Officer that is the lawyer from the Ministry of Justice to come and witness and endorse that.	Ebibiina by'eby'obufuzi babiwandiisa bwe bati mu nsi eno; bafuna abawagizi ebikumi bibiri, ne bakuŋŋaana wamu ne batuuza olukiiko tabamiluka ne bannyonnyola ensonga ebateesezzaawo ekibiina ky'eby'obufuzi, ne bayita Notary Officer ng'ono ye munnamateeka okuva mu Kitongole Ekiramuzi n'abaawo ng'omujjulizi abasemba.
This goes to the Minister of Local Government who ensures that this has gone on according to the law and procedure and brings the matter to cabinet and the party is registered.	Bagenda eri Minisita wa Gavumenti z'Ebitundu n'akakasa nti bagoberedde emitendera n'amateeka ebirambikiddwa oluvannyuma n'ayanjula ensonga mu lukiiko lwa baminisita ekibiina ekyo ne kiwandiisibwa mu butongole
They have had quarrels within the party that neither were they able to bring together a general assembly.	Babaddenga n'enkaayana mu kibiina kyabwe eky'oby'obufuzi era baalemererwa  okutuuza olukiiko tabamiruka
In fact what happened when they tried, they were fighting among themselves and they had split.	Lumu bwe bagezaako okutuuza olukiiko tabamiruka, balwanagana bulwanaganyi era ne beeyawula yawulamu
They had people fighting over the leadership of the party.	Mwalimu abantu abaali bakayaanira obukulembeze bw'ekibiina
I don’t know what happened there, but by the time they came back they had internal problems within the party and they said no, this man who went leading us is not our leader, we don’t want this person.	Ssimanyi ebyo ebyali mu lukiiko, naye baavaayo nga bakayaana nga bagamba nti oyo omusajja tumukooye tetukyamwagala.
These are things we learnt after the minister of Local Government investigated to find out what was wrong.	Waliwo ekirala kye twayiga nga Minisita wa Gavumenti z'Ebitundu amaze okwekkenneenya ensonga z'ekibiina ky'obufuzi ekipya
"Later on, the Minister of Local Government tried to help the Green Party, and he said  ""you know what, if you want to run, you better abide by this,sort out your internal problems, get together, form a general assembly and declare your intentions, and then later on you have to front somebody who will qualify as a presidential candidate and it is as simple as that""."	"Nga wayiseewo ekiseera, Minisita wa Gavumenti z'Ebitundu yagezaako okuyamba ab'ekibiina kya Green Party. Yabagamba bw'ati; ""Mumanyi, bwe muba mwagala ekibiina kyammwe kikkule, musooke mummalawo obutakkaanya obuli mu kibiina kyammwe, mutuuze olukiiko tabamiruka, mwogere ku biruubirirwa by'ekibiina kyammwe, n'oluvannyuma musimbeewo oyo mmwenna gwe munaasemba okuvuganya ku ntebe y'omukulembeze w'eggwanga"
They wouldn’t even challenge these other small parties.	Tewaaliwo kuvuganya kw'amaanyi n'ebibiina ebirala ebitaali bya ttutumu
You can’t blame the international human rights groups when you have failed to explain yourselves.	Temusobola kunnenya balwanirizi b'eddembe ly'obuntu ab'ensi z'ebweru nga mulemereddwa okwennyonnyolako
We have more than explained this story several times with a lot of clarity.	Eno emboozi tugyogeddeko emirundi mingi
We have put together these ambassadors who stay here for example American, European and all others.	Tugezezaako okwogera n'ababaka b'amawanga amalala ababeera mu nsi yaffe, okugeza abo abava mu America, Bulaaya ne mu nsi endala
We have taken them through detail by detail.	Tufuba okubannyonnyola buli kimu
They know it very well.	Bamanyi buli kimu
We shop the world for you!	Tutunda buli kimu ekiri mu nsi
We sell milk coolers of three hundred liters to ten thuosand liters, generators ,milk reception unit yoghurt mixing motor, cream seperator and Butter churner.	Tutunda ebyuma ebinyogoza amata okuva ku lita ebikumi bisatu okutuuka ku lita omutwalo gumu, tutunda zigenereeta, ebyuma ebitabula yoghurt, n'ebyuma ebikola cream n'omuzigo
That is an unprecedented figure.	Ogwo omuwendo tegumanyiddwa.
Your critics are saying that this was a stage-managed election.	Abo abavumirira enkola za gavumenti bagamba nti okulonda kwali kwa kimpatiira
So it is different here in a sense that there are different parties already that exist and that participated in this election process.	Waliwo ebibiina by'eby'obufuzi bikasangwaawo ebyenyigira mu kulonda kuno
But I want to say that you get ninety three percent because of our context.	Naye njagala kukutegeeza nti ommanyi kyenda mu ssatu ku kikumi ku mbeera yaffe
So we have had to build from scratch.	N'olwekyo twalina kutandikawo butandisi kipya
The context involves the fact that there was instability, lack of security, people were desperate, everywhere it was just death and despair.	Embeera ezingiramu okuba nti waaliwo obutaabanguko, ng'abantu baffa nnyo era nga tebalina bukuumi n'assuubi.
We have had to build and as we build, people identify themselves with those people or processes or struggle that have impacted their lives.	Abantu basalawo okukolagana n'abo abalina kye boongera ku bulamu bwabwe
There is a saying in our local language here.	Tulina enŋŋombo mu lulimi lwaffe.
It means, ‘you thank the one who gave you the cow, not the one you anticipate will give you a cow.	Eŋŋombo eyo egamba nti, 'weebaza oyo akuwadde ente, so si oyo gw'osuubira okugikuwa
So their vote was an expression of that culture.	N'olwekyo abantu baalonda balina endowooza
That in other words you and your government created an atmosphere where any strong and potential opposition was crushed.	Mu ngeri endala ggwe ne gavumenti yo mwateekawo embeera eremesa ab'oludda oluvuganya
It is not easy to do that and you continue to gain the confidence of the people.	Gavumenti teyinza kukola ekyo, ab'oludda oluvuganya ne basigaza obuwagizi bw'abantu
Below are edited excerpts of Part one of the interview.	Wansi waliwo ekiwandiiko eky'ekitundu ekisooka ekya yintaviyo
The second part runs in the next edition.	Ekitundu eky'okubiri kiri mu kiwandiiko ekiddako
He had scooped a fully paid scholarship in conflict studies, his dream course.	Yawangula sikaala mu misomo egikwata ku ebyo ebireetera abantu okuba n'obukuubagano era nga yali ajaagala nnyo
He works in a non-governmental organisation, only to be greeted by closed, padlocked doors and police trucks patrolling the University.	Akola mu kitongole kya bannakyewa, naye atuuka ku Yunivasite asanga nzigale era nga waliwo ne polisi
At a press briefing amidst loud applause from staff members.	Ng'ali mu lukuŋŋaana lw'abannamawulire abamu ku bakozi banne basaakanya
The  government committed to take responsibility of the situation.	Gavumenti yasalawo okukola ku nsonga eyo
They demanded an increment in payment	Baali baagala babongeze omusaala
In fact were beginning to think that he has conflict of interest,” he said.	"Yagamba nti,"" baali balowooza nti alina ekiruubirirwa ekirala."""
It was clear that more than eighty percent of the hundreds that had gathered wanted the strike to continue.	kyeraga kaati nti abantu kinaana ku kikumi ku abo abaaliwo baali baagala okwekalakaasa kweyongere mu maaso
We shop the world for you!	Twogera byonna ebifa ku nsi yaffe.
It was not a genuine election.	Okulonda kwalimu okubba akalulu.
One has to know where we are coming from?	Ddala kyetaagisa omuntu okumanya gye tuvudde?
What remained to be your competitors were actually your allies in government who were just escorting you on this joy ride.	Abamu ku abo abaali bakuvuganya beegatta ku gavumenti yo.
The biggest problem is that the university lacks autonomy to implement certain decisions.	Ekizibu ekiriwo kiri nti Yunivasite terina buyinza kussa mu nkola ebyo ebiba bisaliddwawo
The lecturers are demanding a lot of money from the university.	Abasomesa babanja Yunivasite ssente nnyingi.
However, the insurer says the deposits amount to only shillings thirteen billion.	Naye ow'eby'embalirira agamba nti ku akawunta kuliko obuwumbi kkumi n'abusatu bwokka obwa sente za Uganda.
We never used to stage strikes for nothing.	Tetutera kwekalakaasa awatali nsonga
They were tools to right the wrongs like unjustifiable fees increments and poor policies.	Twekalakaasa nga tuwakanya okwongezebwa kw'ebisale by'essomero oba enkola embi
He adds that these events tarnish the image of the university and questions why the government can’t solve them for once and all.	Agamba nti ebyokwekalaakasa byonoona ekifaananyi kya Yunivasite era yeebuuza lwaki gavumenti tegonjoola bizibu ebyo ne biggweerawo ddala
For God ’s sake this is the country’s best university.	Eno ye Yunivasite y'eggwanga enkulu.
For instance this strike has elevated negotiations to a higher level.	Okwekalakaasa kuno kuviiriddeko ensonga okutwalibwa mu mbuga z'amateeka
In case of any problem with the deposited money, government would have to take responsibility towards the depositors. 	Bwe kituuka ku bbula lya ssente mu bbanka, gavumenti y'erina okufuba okukubiriza abantu okutereka ssente mu bbanka
Let us remove our catalyst.	Katulekeeyo okwogera ku kizibu kyaffe
It will not be the first time a strike is suspended to be resumed again.	Okwekalakaasa kusobola okuddamu
When the president failed to turn up to the graduation, the lecturer’s hopes were shuttered.	Abasomesa baggwaamu essuubi ng'omukulembeze w'eggwanga tazze ku mattikira.
What do you expect?” asked the lecturer.	"""Kati olwo ki ky'osuubira?"" bw'atyo omusomesa omu bwe yabuuza."
Strikes should be expected as long as there are disagreements.	Tusuubira okwekalakaasa
Lecturers are paid poorly and not in time because there are no funds and as the result they lay down their tools.	Abasomesa basasulwa bubi, tebasasulwa mu budde olwokuba tewali ssente, ne kinaavamu bajja kussa wansi ebikola
The issue of strikes is mainly because of the poor policies made by the university council,” he says.	"Agamba nti, ""Ekisinga okuleeta okwekalakaasa z'enkola embi eziba zisaliddwawo abo abali ku kakiiko akafuzi aka Yunivasite."""
They are missing the point.	Bava nnyo ku mulamwa
The chairman tried out the two options but he still failed to win the elections in Rubaga.	Ssentebbe bamuwangula mu kalulu k'e Lubaga wadde nga byombi yabikola
The results were the riots and murders which followed the two thousand seven general election there.	Okwekalakaasa n'okuttiŋŋana bye byaliwo nga akalulu ka nkumi bbiri mu musanvu kawedde
The idea that saving the state was the only way to save the power of those sitting in government.	Endowooza ey'okutaasa eggwanga ye yokka eyali esobola okuwonya abo abalina obuyinza mu gavumenti
So, the idea of decentralization was resurrected.	Wajjawo endowooza y'okugabanya obuyinza
There is dissatisfaction with government among those who do not benefit directly from its hospitality or who nurse historical unfairness..	Gavumenti teyagalibwa nnyo abo abatalya buteerevu ku keeki y'eggwanga
But this does not manifest as touch-proof election majorities or civil unrest.	Naye buno si bukakafu obulaga nti abasinga obungi benyigira ku kulonda oba nti waliwo obutabanguko.
Public debate is distracted with changing the people who run the system instead of changing the system itself.	Ebisinga okwogerwako kwe kukyusa abantu abaddukanya enteekateeka eyo mu kifo ky'okukyusa enteekateeka yennyini.
One reason this is so is political.	Kiri bwe kityo kubanga kirimu eby'obufuzi.
The distribution of people and money by district is not uniform.	Sente n'abantu disitulikiti tebigabanyaamu kyenkanyi.
In conditions like that federalism can not work.	Federo teyinza kukolera mu mbeera ng'eyo.
Not for lack of passion or new proposals for reform, those are abundant but for the lack of the right tools.	Si lwa kuba  nti tebalina bwagazi kukikola era nga tebalina na birowooza biyinza kuleetawo nkyukakyuka, naye lwa kuba tebalina bikozesebwa bituufu.
Elections and constitutions are important.	Okulonda ne konsititusoni bikulu nnyo.
That is the point, you need both but they have to arrive together.	Eyo ye nsonga enkulu, byombi obyetaaga naye birina kujjira wamu.
This is different than saying federalism is not needed.	Kino kyanjawulo ku kugamba nti enfuga ya federo teyeetaagisa,
In general, very strong executives in countries with weak or volatile economies are sponges.	Tekiba kyamakulu okuba n'abakulembeze ab'amaanyi mu nsi eri obubi mu by'enfuna.
They soak up money, people and information that could be put to better uses elsewhere.	Baba bajja kutwala ssente n'abantu ebiyinza okukozesebwa awalala.
It is fair to ask what the government has done with its monopoly of power.	Kiba kirungi okwebuuza ekyo gavumenti ky'esobodde okukola mu kwefuga obuyinza.
If that works, though, it will be because people in the districts have clubbed together.	Ekyo bwe kiba kisoboka, kiba kiraga nti abantu mu disitulikiti bakolera wamu.
The Constitutional Court declared the sedition law unconstitutional.	Kkooti eya ssemateeka yagamba nti omusango gw'okulyaamu ensi olukwe teguli mu mateeka.
The sedition law was bad law because it was wild, literally making criticism of government a crime.	Etteeka lino erikwata ku kulyaamu ensi olukwe lyali bbi kubanga omuntu yenna bw'ayogera ku gavumenti aba azizza omusango.
To remove it from our statute books is therefore an important step in promoting democratic debate.	Singa liggyibwa mu bitabo byaffe eby'amateeka, kijja kutumbula demokulasiya.
Anyone who publishes information that is likely to cause disaffection, hatred or contempt against the “person of the president” is a criminal.	Omuntu yenna awandiika ekintu ekikyayisa oba ekivumirira pulezidenti, aba mumenyi w'amateeka.
Therefore, people should be free to try and spread disaffection, hatred and contempt against him personally.	N'olwekyo, abantu basaanidde okuba n'eddembe okukola ekintu ng'ekyo.
To criminalise such actions is as good as saying the president should not be criticised.	Okulowooza nti omuntu aba ezizza omusango okukola ekintu ng'ekyo, kiba kiraga nti pulezidenti talina kwogerwako.
The existence of independent courts and  judges with confidence to make a judgment against the state could only have been possible.	Kyandibadde kisoboka okuba ne kkooti eyetengeredde era n'abalamuzi abeetengeredde abasobola okusalira gavumenti omusango.
Instead, the government has promised to appeal to the Supreme Court, itself a legally legitimate step.	Mu kifo ky'ekyo, gavumenti esuubizza okuddukira mu kkooti ensukulumu, ate nga nayo eriwo mu mateeka.
Besides, the Supreme Court has almost already pronounced itself on this law. 	Ng'oggyeko ekyo, kkooti ensukulumu emaze okulaga oludda lw'eriko ku tteeka lino.
The principles of command set out in that judgment formed the basis for the judgment.	Omusingi oguli mu nsala y'omusango gwe gwesigamiziddwako okusala omusango.
The president and his ruling party have consistently argued that they put in place a democratisation process.	Pulezidenti n'ekibiina kye ekiri mu buyinza bulijjo bagamba nti bataddewo enkola ya demokulasiya.
The basis of this process was the constitution making exercise.	Enkola eno yeesigamiziddwa ku kukolebwa kwa konsititusoni.
There is therefore a big gap between promoting democracy and the actual politics.	N'olwekyo waliwo enjawulo ya maanyi nnyo wakati w'okutumbula demokulasiya n'eby'obufuzi.
On the contrary, it has reinforced many of them.	Okwawukana ku ekyo, ebiwadde amaanyi.
It is currently writing a media regulatory law.	Mu kiseera kino waliwo okuwandiikibwa kw'amateeka agafuga emikutu gy'eby'empuliziganya.
This has previously been driven by the spread of radio.	Kino kitumbuddwa nnyo olwa radiyo ezeeyongedde obungi.
Increasingly, the computer and the mobile phone handset are connecting most especially around information and news.	Okusingira ddala kompyuta n'amasimu bituusa ku bantu amawulire aga wano.
Moreover, across this country, there is an unsual boom in education at all levels, most importantly secondary and university education.	Songa ate mu nsi endala waliyo bingi ebikwata ku by'enjigiriza nnaddala ebyo ebya siniya ne Yunivasite.
Websites and blogs are spreading like wildfire and today constitute the most effective forms of communication by our growing middleclass.	Emikuttu emiyunga bantu nagyo gyeyongedde obungi ne kiba nti eby'empuliziganya byeyongedde okuba ebirungi.
The registrar, dressed in a navy-blue suit, was not used to the media spotlight. 	Omuwandiisi eyali ayambadde esuuti eya bululu yali tamanyiridde kubuuzibwa bibuuzo bannamawulire.
Together the men were challenging the constitutionality of the rebellion charges the state had imposed against them.	Bombi baali bawakanya obutuufu bw'omusango gw'obujeemu gavumenti gwe yali ebasibyeko.
Around the country, journalists, politicians, students were glued to their televisions in prediction.	Okwetooloola eggwanga lyonna, bannamawulire, bannabyabufuzi n'abayizi amaaso baali bagasimbye ku ttivi zaabwe.
The Daily Monitor’s newsroom briefly stopped chasing their daily stories to hear the Constitutional Court’s decision.	Ab'olupapula lw'amawulire olwa Monitor baasooka ne bayimirizaamu okufulumya amawulire nga bwe balinda okusalawo kwa kkooti ya ssemateeka.
After the summation came a summary of the submissions of the petitioner and a summary of the state’s responses.	Oluvannyuma lw'ensala ya kkooti, baawa okuwumbawumba okukwata ku muwaabi w'omusango n'ekyo gavumenti kye yagamba.
The strength of officeholders and institutions at the centre is decreasing relative to the rest of the country.	Amaanyi g'abo abali mu zi ofiisi ne gavumenti yennyini geeyongera okukkendera mu ggwanga lyonna.
In Uganda there is frustration with the government but no real balance to it.	Mu Uganda abantu bawulira nga gavumenti ebamazzeemu amaanyi naye tebalina kya kukola.
And also local government, or it could have tried to buy off disaffected tribes.	Era ne gavumenti ez'ebitundu, oba yandigezezaako okusasula ebikka ebitali bimativu.
The realisation that worse violence was near and the influence of donors and international agencies finally brought home the idea.	Eky'okuba nti ebikolwa eby'obukambwe eby'amaanyi byali biri kumpi okukoma, era n'obuyambi bw'abagabirizi b'obuyambi n'ebibiina ebirala  mu nsi yonna, byasobozesa ensonga okulambikibwa obulungi.
This was because districts were too poor to deliver on the short term expectations of participants.	Kyali bwe kityo kubanga disitulikiti zaali njavu nnyo nga tezesobola kutuukiriza ekyo mu kiseera ekitono ekyali kibaweereddwa.
And not everybody in a district is an opponent of the central government.	Si buli omu mu disitulikiti nti mulabe wa gavumenti.
And far from pressure to limit the total there is little standing in the way of increasing it by administrative order.	Ng'oggyeko okukolera mu bugubi, waliwo obutamanya ngeri ya kukolamu mirimu.
But they must arrive together with economic power directed to the same end if they are to be successful.	Naye bwe baba ab'okutuuka ku buwanguzi, balina okuba n'ekiruubirirwa kimu mu nkola y'emirimu.
And even to manipulate or avoid rulings of the High Court.	Era n'okulimba oba okwewala ensala ya kkooti enkulu.
Because they are the only institution strong enough to ensure that it gets what it wants.	Kubanga kye kitongole kyokka ekisobola okukakasa nti kifuna bye kyagala.
Pooled resources and created political and economic power through their cooperation and directed it to their own, local benefit.	Beegatta ne bassaawo eby'obufuzi n'eby'enfuna okuyitira mu bibiina byabwe ebiyamba abantu mu kitundu kyabwe.
That is according to the law of sedition.	Ekyo kisinziira ku tteeka erikwata ku kulya mu nsi olukwe.
Those who feel an incumbent president has done a poor job.	Abo abalowooza nti pulezidenti aliko takoze mulimu mulungi.
This is in the sedition suit in the Constitutional Court.	Kino kiri mu musango oguli mu kkooti ogukwata ku kulya mu nsi olukwe.
This is if combined with the spread of mobile phone usage across the country is rapidly rendering government control of information flow.	Kiri bwe kityo singa okwongerezaako, enkozesa y'amasimu mu ggwanga yeeyongera okuleetera gavumenti okufuga eby'empuliziganya.
Luckily, giraffes have elastic blood vessels in their necks, this makes it possible for them to drink water from a stream, without fainting.	Ekirungi kiri nti entugga zirina emisuwa egigonda mu bulago egigisobozesa okunywa amazzi mu luzzi ne zitaziyiira.
A group of giraffes constitute a herd.	Entugga bwe zibeera awamu nga nnyingi, kiba kiraalo.
Neck wrestling matches are often held to show authority in their herds.	Okuzannya kwe ziba nabo nga zikozesa obulago, kiba kiraga obuyinza bwe zirina mu kiraalo.
A giraffe is the one of the largest, strongest and peaceful animals on Earth.	Entugga y'emu ku nsolo ezisingayo okuba ennene, ez'amaanyi era ez'emirembe mu nsi yonna.
An adult male giraffe is called a bull, a female is called a cow and a young giraffe a calf.	Entugga enkulu nga nsajja eyitibwa nnume, ate enkazi eyitibwa nte ate ento eyitibwa nyana.
The average life span of a giraffe is twenty to twenty five years.	Entugga esobola okuwangala emyaka abiri oba abiri mu ettaano.
A large male giraffe can eat up to one hundred pounds of food in a single day.	Entugga ennene obulungi esobola okulya kilo nga attaano olunaku.
He was replaced by successive insatiable other eaters.	Yasikirwa abalala ab'omululu.
What is most amusing is his reason for not leaving.	Ekisinga okwewunyisa ye nsonga gye yawa ey'obutagenda.
That his government has made a lot of money for the country and it would be foolhardy to leave it for others to enjoy it.	Nti kubanga gavumenti ye ekoze ssente nnyingi nnyo era nti kyandibadde kya busiru okuzirekera abalala okuzirya.
Now that he is entering the last year of his contract, he says he cannot leave because he has made a lot of profit for the company.	Kati ng'ayingidde omwaka ggwe ogusembayo, agamba nti tayinza kugenda kubanga kampuni agikoledde ssente nnyingi nnyo.
We are entering a good service with the production of oil, security is good and those who led the liberation should be part of the team that looks after these resources.	Kati tugenda kuyingira mu buweereza obulungi kubanga amafuta gagenda kutandika okusimibwa, eby'okwerinda nabyo birungi era abo abeenyigira mu kununula ensi eno basaanidde okuba mu abo abagenda okulabirira eby'obuggaga buno.
The president concluded that it was a strange occurrence.	Pulezidenti yagamba nti ekyo ekibaddewo si kya bulijjo.
When a manager makes profit for a company and even gives dividends to the shareholders, does he declare he cannot leave to let new managers eat the money he made for the enterprise? 	Manejja bw'akola amagoba era n'abalala abali mu busineesi eyo n'abawa ennyongeza, kiba kiraga nti tasaanidde kugenda alekere bamanejja abalala nabo balye ku ssente ze yakolera kampuni?
Cruel hand of death strikes and life can be real cruel.	Okufa bwe kubaawo, obulamu buyinza okuzibuwala.
Imagine you are wining, dining and dancing and in the next hour you are in a mortuary or unconscious on the hospital bed.	Kubamu akafaananyi ng'otuuse ku buwanguzi, oli ku mmeeza olya era ng'ozina n'amazina, naye mu ssaawa eddako n'oba ng'oli mu ggwanika oba ng'oli mu ddwaliro totegeera.
The police said the cause of accident is suspected to have been high speed and overloading.	Poliisi yagamba nti okuvuga endiima n'okuttika akabindo bye byaviirako akabenje.
Driving under influence of alcohol could not be ruled out in such circumstances.	Era kiyinzika n'okuba nti eyali avuga yali atamidde.
Such is the everyday trend of carnage on the Ugandan roads.	Ekyo bulijjo kye kiviirako obubenje mu nguudo za Uganda.
The fire outbreak that destroyed merchandise of unspecified amount was attributed to an electric fault.	Kyagambibwa nti omuliro ogwasanyaawo eby'amaguzi ebingi bwe kibyo gwava ku masanyalaze agaaliko ekizibu.
Voting in many parts of the country was disrupted by violence and the delay of election materials.	Okulonda mu bitundu bingi eby'eggwanga kwatabulwatabulwa olw'okulwanagana n'okulwawo kw'ebikozesebwa mu kulonda.
By then, however, at least 32 lives, including members of parliament, had been lost.	Kyokka, mu kiseera ekyo, abantu nga 32 nga mw'otwalidde n'omubaka wa palamenti baali bafiiriddwa obulamu bwabwe.
This is an extraordinary casualty toll in a single military offensive.	Abantu abo abaafa omulundi ogumu baali bangi nnyo okusinga ku mbeera eya bulijjo ng'amaggye gazinzeeko ekitundu.
But one firm lesson has been delivered.	Naye waliwo eky'okuyiga eky'amaanyi kye tufunye mu kino.
Africa is unable to sort its house in order.	Afirika terina busobozi kumalawo bizibu byayo.
Supporters of federo here are asking themselves whether Ugandans could accomplish the same thing.	Abo abawagira federo beebuuza obanga Uganda esobola okukola ekintu kye kimu.
It might not surprise anyone if the oil proceeds go into the pockets of only those who led the liberation.	Kiyinza obuteewunyisa muntu yenna singa ssente eziva mu mafuta zigenda mu nsawo z'abo abaakulemberamu olutalo lw'okununula.
He has been leading our country for a quarter of a century hence the levels of poverty in the country and the level of corruption.	Y'abadde omukulembeze w'ensi yaffe okumala emyaka 25 n'olwekyo tekyewunyisa nti waliwo obwavu obw'amaanyi mu nsi yaffe awomu n'obuli bw'enguzi.
So whoever engages in kidnap must be treated as a terrorist.	N'olwekyo, buli muntu eyenyigira mu kiwamba bantu alina kutwalibwa ng'omutujju.
The main causes of the estimated five million deaths of children under the age of five are malnutrition, diarrheoa, respiratory infections and malaria.	Ebisinga okuleetera abaana okufa abateebeerezebwa okuba mu bukadde butaano abali wansi w'emyaka ettaano kwe kulya obubi, ekiddukano, ekiziyiiro n'omusujja gw'ensiri.
In Uganda the people do not own the budget.	Mu Uganda abantu si be bannanyini mbalirira ya ggwanga.
The desire cannot be contained forever by prison walls, or martial laws, or secret police.	Okwagala okukola ekintu tekuyinza kumalibwawo makomera, amateeka agakwata ku bufumbo, oba poliisi.
Over time, and across the Earth, freedom will find a way.	Ekiseera kituuka era mu nsi yonna ne wabaawo eddembe.
It always seems impossible until its done.	Bulijjo kiba kirabika ng'ekitasoboka okutuusa nga kikoleddwa.
There were wild celebrations among journalists and politicians last week when the Constitutional Court nullified the sedition law.	Waaliwo okujjaganya kwa maanyi nnyo wiiki ewedde mu bannamawulire ne mu bannabyabufuzi nga kkooti esazizzaamu etteeka erikwata ku kulya mu nsi olukwe.
Each time a giraffe lifts up its neck it picks up five hundred and fifty pounds.	Entugga buli lw'eyimusa obulago bwaayo, eyoola kilo 275.
A new born giraffe measures about six feet.	Entugga eyaakazaalibwa eweza ffuuti mukaaga obuwanvu.
A giraffe is one of the animals who is born with a horn.	Entugga y'emu ku nsolo ezizaalibwa n'amayembe.
The scientific name of the giraffe is Camelopardalis.	Erinnya ly'Entugga erya kinnasayansi ye Camelopardalis.
Each giraffe has a unique coat pattern.	Buli Ntugga erina engeri ya njawulo gy'eba ettoneddwattoneddwamu.
The tongue of an adult giraffe measures twenty seven inches.	Olulimu lw'Entugga enkulu luweza yinkyi abiri mu musanvu.
Giraffes are vegetarians and live on the leaves of the baobab tree.	Entugga zirya muddo n'amakoola g'emiti.
Every step a giraffe takes is fifteen feet in length.	Buli lutta entugga lw'ekuba luweza ffuuti kkumi na taano.
The giraffe is able to grasp objects such as leaves with the help of its tongue.	Entugga zikozesa olulimi lwaazo okukwata ebintu gamba ng'ebikoola by'omuti.
Giraffes sleep for no more than five to thirty minutes in twenty four hours.	Entugga zeebaka kumala ddakiika ezitasukka ttaano oba amakumi asatu mu ssaawa abiri mu nnya.
The film has been screened around the world, collecting praise and six international awards.	Firimu eno ekwatiddwa okwetooloola ensi yonna, era etenderezeddwa nnyo era n'efuna n'ebirabo mukaaga eby'ensi yonna.
As it stands, the industry is propped up by one off commissions, donations, art grants and filmmakers who are able to self-finance.	Kino kiwomyemu omutwe abakwasi ba firimu abasobola okweyimirizaawo bokka.
There is no properly functioning infrastructure that ensures any lasting growth.	Tewaliiwo kintu kyonna kikola bulungi kiyinza kuleetawo nkolakulaana ya lubeerera.
The best he can hope for is to leave it with the people who run the pirate DVD racket around the country as they have more expertise than anyone else.	Ekintu ekisingayo obulungi ky'ayinza okusuubira kwe kukirekera abantu abaddukanya DVD okwetooloola eggwanga lyonna kubanga bo balina obumanyirivu okusinga omunutu omulala yenna.
There is no legitimate framework that filmmakers can work within once they’ve actually created their product, it just gets released to whomever or wherever will stock it.	Tewaliiwo nkola yonna ekkirizibwa mu mateeka nti abakwasi ba firimu basobola okukolera wano kasita bamala okukola ebintu byabwe, biweebwa omuntu yenna anaasobola okubitunda.
The only way he has ever gotten any recognition is by entering film festivals.	Ekintu kyokka mwe yali amanyikiddwa kwe kuba nti yayingira mu lwokaano lw'okukwata firimu.
Sometimes it takes too long for films to get here or they don’t appear at all, so in the end I grow tired of looking for it.	Oluusi kitwala ekiseera kiwanvu firimu okutuuka wano era oluusi tezirabikira ddala, n'olwekyo ku nkomerero nkoowa okuzinoonya.
He stripped it back to the basics of what being in a creative industry means, communication.	Yannyonnyola bulungi ebyo ebizingirwamu okusobola okukola omulimu guno ogwetaagisa okuba omuteeteenkanya, nga kwe kuba n'empuliziganya ennungi.
It’s all about being an excellent communicator.	Kyetaagisa okuba n'empuliziganya ennungi.
Film is the language of many different nations and people, I truly believe that it has the ability to change the world.	Firimu lwe lulimi olwogerwa amawanga mangi n'abantu abatali bamu, era nkikkiriza nti kisobola okukyusa ensi eno.
"For her, it’s something she feels she has to do.“Acting lives in me"" she says."	"Yalowooza nti kye kintu ky'alina okukola. ""Okuzannya abantu abalala"" bw'atyo bw'agamba."
She says if they gave her any part, she would do it.	Agamba nti singa bamuwa ekitundu kyonna, asobola okukizannya.
"""I know I’ll make it, I have faith, I have hope"" she says."	"Agamba nti: ""mmanyi nga njakukisobola, ekyo nkikkiriza, era nkisuubira."""
She is always perfectly dressed, ready trained for stardom, and burns with ambition. 	Bulijjo aba ayambadde bulungi, nga yeetegekedde okuba emmunyeenye era ng'alina okwagala kungi nnyo.
Her days are spent meeting with potential employers, cajoling them, networking, persuading and constantly selling herself to everyone just in case they might be the ones to take her to the heady heights of fame.	Buli kiseera aba asisinkana abo abayinza okumuwa emirimu, ng'afuba okubamatiza, ng'akolagana n'abantu abalala, ng'abasendasenda era ng'afuba okwewomya eri buli muntu sinakindi nga be basobola okumuyamba okuyitamu.
This is part of what these workshops have given her.	Bino by'afunye mu nkuŋŋaana nga zino.
Film appears to have a great future.	Kirabika ebiseera eby'omu maaso ebya ffirimu bitangavu.
Beware of the new breed of men.	Mwekuume abasajja ab'omulembe guno.
He is good looking and well groomed.	Alabika bulungi era yeekozeeko bulungi.
Have you noticed that it is becoming difficult to distinguish male from female behaviour today?	Okyetegeereza nti si kyangu nnyo leero okwawula omusajja ku mukazi?
Personally I hate it.	Nze kino sikyagalira ddala.
We were created differently for a reason other than sexual compatibility.	Waliwo ensonga lwaki twatondebwa nga tuli ba njawulo ng'oggyeko okuba nti tuli basajja na bakazi.
This trend of unisex is spreading rapidly.	Kino eky'okuba ng'oli musajja ate ng'oli mu kazi kyeyongedde nnyo leero.
"As a result, we have the equivalent of the “dumb blonde""."	Ekivuddemu, kwe kuba n'endabika etategeerekeka bulungi.
Like the female variant, this breed of men is cute.	Ng'oggyeko okuba n'endabika ey'ekikazi, abasajja ab'engeri ng'eno balabika bulungi.
They are usually slim, tall, light or dark skinned or of average build showing their six pack and wear tit revealing tshirts.	Batera kuba batono, nga bawanvu, nga beeru oba baddugavu era nga bambala tshirt eziraga amabeere.
You cannot miss to see both earlobes pricked and accompanied by diamond studs.	Baba n'empeta ku matu
Real men are uncomfortable near these guys who should not be confused for jerks.	Abasajja beenyini tebawulira bulungi bwe babeera okumpi n'abantu bano ababa balabika ng'abaagala okubuuka mu bbanga.
Jerks are like crows.	Galinga mmalala.
It is for this reason that I insist on bringing to your attention the difference between the elusive good guys who you will never marry.	Eno ye nsonga lwaki njagadde nnyo okubabuulira enjawulo eri ku basajja abalabika obulungi be mutasaanidde kufumbirwa.
The jerks lie and break hearts.	Abasajja ab'ekikka kino balimba era bakuttula omutima.
Their behaviour is pretty unpredictable.	Enneeyisa yaabwe tetegeerekeka.
If you ignore him, he treats it like a turn on.	Bwomulaga nti tomufaako, awo obanga amuleese.
If you abuse him, you appeal to his resilience.	Bwomuvuma, omusikiriza busikiriza.
If you succumb he will dump you, when caught redhanded he will deny.	Bwomulemerako akusuulawo, ate bwomukwata lubona, yeegaana.
If you fall in love, you will be used.	Bw'omwagala, ajja kukukozesa.
If you get pregnant, he will take a walk forever.	Bw'ofuna olubuto, toliddayo kumulabako.
But perhaps most important is the medium itself, not as inaccessibly highbrow as visual art, not as prohibitively expensive or elitist as fashion, a truism that applies all over the world.	Naye oboolyawo ekisinga obukulu gwe mutindo, si lwa kuba nti bagezi nnyo, oba nti ba bbeeyi nnyo oba nti balabika bulungi era nga basobola okubeera awantu wonna mu nsi.
The way a novel can absorb someone is often remarkably all encompassing but it remains an experience restricted to good readers.	Ekitabo kisobola okunnyonnyolera ddala omuntu n'oyo aba asoma n'anyumirwa.
Film, on the other hand, can be consumed and understood by pretty much everyone and it can have a similar immersive quality.	Kyokka ku ludda olulala, ffirimu yo buli muntu yenna asobola okugitegeera obulungi oboolyawo ng'ekitabo bwe kiba.
For a long time these jerks have prowled, leaving shattered hearts in their wake.	Abasajja nga bano bamaze ekiseera kiwanvu nga beeyisa bwe batyo era bakuttudde bangi emitima.
Until now, their dominance is unmatched.	Era si kyangu kutuuka ku kye bakoze.
They are only good for show cuties whose only claim to fame is a cute face.	Baagala kweraga bwerazi.
Don’t pretend to be surprised.	Ttoba ng'omuntu eyeewunyizza ennyo.
I happened to catch some local male “celebs” hanging out in a beauty parlour, not a barber shop for your information.	Waliwo omu ku bavubuka bano gwe nnasanga mu kifo we bayooyotera abantu, si mu saaluuni zino eza bulijjo.
They had facial masks on, cucumbers on their eyes and were waiting in the queue to be manicured and pedicured.	Baaliko obukookolo, nga ku maaso gaabwe bataddeko kyukamba era nga balindiridde okubakola enjala.
When did men get so lazy that they cannot find time to clip their own toenails?	Abasajja baatuuka ddi okuba abagayaavu bwe batyo ne kiba nti tebasobola na kwesala njala?
Men now exfoliate their faces and visit saloons!	Abasajja kati beekuuta feessi era ne bagenda mu saaluuni okwekolako.
Guys are now keeping ripened avocado in their fridges, not for the health salads but for a face mask.	Abasajja kati batereka ovakado omwengevu mu ffirigi nga si wa kulya naye wa kwekolako ku ffeessi.
What the hell is going on?	Kiki kno ekigenda mu maaso?
They wait to be offered drinks.	Balindirira okubawa eby'okunywa.
They wine, are moody, shop cosmetics, spend a lot of money on clothes and they gossip too.	Banywa enviinyo, embeera zaabwe zikyukakyuka, bagula ebizigo, bakozesa ssente nnyingi okugula engoye era ba lugambo.
They are a total disgrace.	Baswaza nnyo.
The sad thing is that, there are women like them.	Ey'ennaku kiri nti waliwo n'abakazi abalinga bo.
I guess the game has come full swing.	Ndowooza kati kino kituuse wala nnyo.
If this kind of man ever asked you, believe you me, he is not fun to hang out with but in a life time you need to give it a try.	Ka nkubuulire, abasajja nga bano si balungi kwesanyusaamuko nabo, naye oboolyawo oyinza okukigezaako.
Not as in the case of the “dumb male blonde”, who has a simple natural appearance that looks innocent and with a friendly face.	Si nga bali abeekuuta ffeessi, abalabika ng'abatalina musango era ab'ekisa.
It takes decades or more than three thousand kilometres before they lay eyes on decent ladies not because the ladies are out of reach but because they do not have a proper strategy or vibe to convince these ladies.	Kibatwalira ebbanga ddene nga tebannalabayo bakazi balabika bulungi si lwa kuba nti tebabasobola naye lwa kuba tebalina bukodyo bwa kumatiza bakazi ng'abo.
I mean that the ladies have got more brain matter than these lads.	Kyentegeeza kiri nti abakazi bategeera nnyo okusinga abalenzi abo.
This kind of men is a bit wide-spread throughout the country, so the elite woman is trying to avoid them but before you know a dozen more of this type spring up.	Abasajja ab'ekikka kino kumpi bali buli wamu mu nsi yaffe, n'olwekyo abakazi bano abategeevu bagezaako okubeewala naye ate ogenda okulaba ng'abalala bangi beeyongeddeko.
When you stare in the face of this wannabe, you will discover he is so daft because he cannot get it through his thick skull that you are damn bored of his hallucinations or is it called illusions.	Bw'otunuula mu maaso g'omuntu ono ojja kukiraba nti musiru nnyo kubanga tayinza kukitegeera nti weetamiddwa obulimba bwe.
Because he has asked you out for dinner, you decide to give it a try and accept his invitation to a restaurant.	Olw'okuba akusabye mugende muliireko wamu ekijjulo, osalawo ogezeeko okukikola era n'okkiriza mugende ku wooteeri.
Each time a character made a joke, the place would explode with laughter, chatter and shouted comments.	Buli lw'ayogera ng'asaagirira, abaliwo batumbuka ne baseka, era ne boogerera waggulu.
Film has an incredible advantage because of how it can appeal to people’s emotions through visuals as well as through sound.	Ffirimu erina ebirungi bingi kubanga abantu bye balaba ne bye bawulira birina engeri gye bibakwatako.
Young filmmakers want to be able to tell their stories and to be able to tell them in a way that touches people both domestically and internationally.	Abo abaakatandika okukola ffirimu baagala okwogera ebibakwatako era nga kino bakikola mu ngeri ekweta ku bantu yonna gye bali.
I am told it’s because men are learning to embrace their sexuality.	ŋŋambiddwa nti kiri bwe kityo kubanga abasajja baagala okulaga nti ddala basajja.
It explains why they all have the same sob story about some jerk who slept with them, then turned over and snored.	Eno ye nsonga lwaki bonna banyumya mu ngeri y'emu ku bikwata ku oyo eyasuze nabo, ate oluvannyuma n'akyuka n'atandika okufuluuta.
My sister Irene, thinks it is cool for men to groom themselves.	Muganda wange Irene y'alowooza nti kirungi nnyo abasajja okwekolako bwe batyo.
It is what women demand, cute pets.	Ekyo abakazi kye baagala, omuntu alabika obulungi.
This breed of guys speak something like, “Man, that chic has the latest play station at her crib” or worse, “did you see the ride she spins?”	"Abasajja ab'engeri eno boogera bwe bati, ""owange, akawala ako kamanyi okuzannya"" oba ekisingawo n'obubi, ""walabye bwe katambula?"""
Please guys, give us a break.	Bannange, mutulekeeko.
We were quite satisfied with the transparency of it all.	Tubadde bamativu n'obwerufu bwakyo.
Of course there were challenges.	Kyokka wabaddewo ebisoomooza.
They did not mind much about the spoilt ballots.	Tebaafaayo nnyo ku bululu obwafa.
But the process was good.	Naye enteekateeka yagenda bulungi.
What did they do with the spoilt ballots?	Obwo obwafa baabukola batya?
Then all of them were put together in the ballot box.	Bwonna bwateekebwa mu kasanduuko k'obululu.
That is what we saw.	Ekyo kye twalaba.
For the technical aspect of it all, counting at the polling station went well.	Naye okutwalira awamu, okubala obululu kwagenda bulungi.
In fact we had our people in the districts who had not even been noticed of the outcome of the voting.	Twalina abantu baffe mu disitulikiti abaataamanya byava mu kulonda.
The procedure is clear that the thing will go to the centre and from the center to the district, and then to the national.	Enkola nnambulukufu bulungi kubanga ebintu bijja kuva ku kitebe, bive ku kitebe bitwalibwe ku disitulikiti ate bive awo bitwalibwe byonna eby'eggwanga we binaatuukira.
Many experts of the government argue there was no electoral competition.	Abakugu ba gavumenti bangi bagamba nti tewaaliiwo kuvuganya mu by'okulonda.
This concept of escorts is only said by those who are criticizing him.	Ebyo eby'okubeera emperekeze byogerwa abo bokka abamuvumirira.
These people who are the Liberal party, the Socialist party, they are among those who suffered in the genocide.	Abo abali mu bibiina bya Liberal Party ne Socialist Party be bamu ku abo abaabonaabona ennyo mu kittabantu.
I would not call them escorts, but they definitely were not critical opponents of the government.	Ssandyagadde kubayita mperekeze naye bo tebaali balabe ba gavumenti.
I do not know how good they were.	Ssimanyi bulungi bwabwe.
From what we saw from this party, they are not connected in the crimes or involved with the past and so on.	Okusinziira ku ebyo bye tulaba mu kibiina kino, bo tebeenyigira mu buzzi bw'emisango oba mu ebyo ebyaliwo emmabega.
However, there may be other reasons and the state can make an explanation.	Naye wayinza okubaawo ensonga endala gavumenti gy'eyinza okunnyonnyola.
In situations like this, it is in the interest of the democratic system to be as inclusive as possible.	Mu mbeera ng'eno, kiba kyetaagisa okuba omugezigezi ku lw'obulungi bwa demokulasiya.
This country went through genocide and genocide is not a joke.	Eno ensi ebaddemu ekittabantu era nga kino si kintu kya muzannyo.
Over one million people were killed and we have some people who are not even reconciled that people were killed.	Abantu abasukka mu kakadde baattibwa era tulinawo abantu abatannaba kuddiŋŋaana olw'okuttibwa kw'abantu baabwe.
We have to be careful and make sure that the things that bring about such hatred are not allowed to happen.	Tulina okuba abeegendereza okulaba nti ebintu ebireetawo obukyayi tebiddamu kubaawo nate.
When we talk of balancing, we are talking of the need to be careful.	Bwe twogera ku ky'obutaggwa lubege tuba tutegeeza okuba abeegendereza.
But the other extreme is balance that ensures that there is a degree of inclusivity in the process.	Naye era obutaggwa lubege kitegeeza kutwaliramu abantu bonna mu nteekateeka eno.
That’s what makes the process of democratic dispensation succeed.	Ekyo kye kisobozesa demokulasiya okubaawo.
Did you feel that there was enough public debate on the electoral process and the candidates?	Olowooza abantu baakubaganya ebirowoozo ekimala ku nteekateeka y'eby'okulonda ne ku abo abeesimbyewo?
So whatever happened could have happened before.	N'olwokyo bwe wabaawo ekintu kyonna ekyaliwo, ekyo kiteekwa okuba nga kyaliwo nga bukyali.
For example, New Times had more extensive coverage to the incumbent than the opposition.	Ng'ekyokulabirako, olupapula lw'amawulire oluyitibwa New Times lwayogera nnyo ku pulezidenti okusinga ku abo abali ku ludda oluvuganya gavumenti.
But the government media, including radio and television, from what we saw, went out of the way.	Naye emikuttu gy'eby'empulizigaanya egya gavumenti nga mw'otwalidde radiyo ne ttivi byava ku mulamwa.
His experts are saying rallies of the opposition were less attended because there was widespread fear in this country.	Abakugu be bagamba nti enkuŋŋaana z'abo abali ku ludda oluvuganya gavumenti tezaalingamu bantu bangi kubanga waaliwo okutya kungi mu ggwanga.
On the one hand all these opposition say they are part of the alliance.	Ku luuyi olulala, bonna abali ku ludda oluvuganya gavumenti bagamba nti bali bumu.
I think that is funny.	Nze ndowooza ekyo kisesa busesa.
I do not buy that.	Ssikikkiriza.
If you support this opposition you are considered to be an enemy of the state.	Bw'owagira oludda oluvuganya gavumenti otwalibwa okuba omulabe wa gavumenti.
Everybody in the press is saying the opposition are just escorts of the president.	Ab'amawulire bonna bagamba nti abali ku ludda oluvuganya gavumenti bo bawerekerako buwerekezi puliezidenti.
But you are either this or the other, you can’t be both.	Naye oteekwa okubaako n'oludda lw'owagira, toyinza kuba ku njuuyi zombi.
Did you talk to the other opposition candidates about their feelings towards the process?	Wayogerako n'abo abeesimbyewo ku ludda oluvuganya gavumenti okusobola okumanya endowooza yaabwe ku nteekateeka eno?
The people who were not satisfied were the other opposition.	Abantu abatali bamativu baali ku ludda luli oluvuganya gavumenti.
He was also very polite.	Era yali mukwatampola.
He is not one of those opposition who come out and start abusing.	Tali ng'abo abalala abali ku ludda oluvuganya gavumenti abavaayo ne batandika okuvuma abalala.
During the campaign process I did not hear candidates criticizing the other.	Mu kiseera ky'okukuba kampeyini ssawulira beesimbyewo nga bavumagana.
They seemed to focus their messages on what they planned to do.	Essira baaliteeka ku ebyo bye baagala okukolera abantu.
Did you find that odd? It is the style.	Olowooza ekyo kyali kikyamu? Bwe kityo bwe kirina okuba.
It is not common to have that experience.	Si kya bulijjo ekyo okubaawo.
Parties in an alliance will always be more careful and alart of what they criticize.	Ebibiina ebikolera awamu bulijjo biba byegendereza nnaddala ku nsonga gye baba balina okwogerako.
And even now there has been a transformation in the country.	Ne mu kiseera kino wabaddewo enkyukakyuka mu ggwanga.
People are polite and are talking about nation building.	Abantu bawombeefu era boogera ku ngeri y'okuzimbamu eggwanga.
You cannot expect the strong,  hostile, abuse coming out from any of these parties.	Toyinza kusuubira muntu yenna okuva mu bibiina bino okuba omukambwe ennyo oba okuvumagana ekisukkiridde.
Did you get the sense that the crowds were there out of fear rather than out of support for the president?	Wakitegedde nti abantu babadde bangi olw'okutya so lwa kuba nti bawagira pulezidenti?
Do not underestimate people’s intelligence.	Tobuusa maaso kutegeera kw'abantu.
These are not cows.	Zino si nte.
These are human beings.	bano bantu.
Let us say there was a certain level of terrorizing.	Kale katugambe nti wabaddewo engeri y'okutiisatiisa.
Why did they turn up in such large numbers for the president? Were they also terrorized to vote?	Lwaki baali bangi nnyo abaawagira pulezidenti? Tugambe nti era baatiisibwatiisibwa okusobola okumulonda?
The accuracy we can make about this thing is to also be sufficientlyfreehearted.	Tulina okubeera abeesimbu nga twogera ku nsonga eno.
I must say I am a bit uncomfortable with the fact that the polling went so smoothly and efficiently.	Njagala nkutegeze nti siwulira bulungi ku ky'okuba nti okulonda kwagenda bulungi nnyo.
The capital city is flooded in campaign posts.	Ekibuga kyonna kijjuddemu ebifaanayi by'abo abeesimbyewo.
Faces and slogans are made to be seen and read.	Ebifaananyi bittimbiddwa buli wamu abantu basobole okubiraba n'okubisomako.
As elections draw closer some of them might even become campaign tunes.	Ng'okulonda kugenda kusembera, ebimu ku byo biyinza n'okuvaamu amaloboozi.
Each candidate uses their posters in different ways.	Buli omu ku abo abeesimbyewo alina engeri gy'akozesaamu ebifaananyi bye.
Some like to have their face as pronounced as possible to carry an image of power.	Abamu baagala ebifaananyi byabwe bikyoleke nti balina obusobozi bungi.
Many candidates come up with their own slogans before giving them to advertising agencies to produce.	Abeesimbyewo bangi beefunira ebigambo byabye ne babiwa abo abagenda okubikuba mu kyappa.
Here are a few interesting campaign signs The Independent noticed during its tour through the city.	Waliwo ebimu ku bifaananyi by'abo abeesimbyewo ebisanyusa Independenti bye yalaba ng'eyitayita mu kibuga.
What kind of candidate are you?	Oli muntu eyeesimbyewo wa ngeri ki?
This means appreciate what you have instead of craving what have not seen.	Kino kiba kitegeeza nti olina okusiima ebyo by'olina mu kifo ky'okwegomba by'otalina.
It might lack originality but will probably work well during the campaigns if people have to sing.	Kiyinza obutabaako mulamwa gwonna naye oboolyawo kiyinza okuba eky'amakulu mu kiseera kya kampeyini abantu bwe bayimba.
They could be perceived as supporting a particular party or candidate afterward.	Oluvannyuma bayinza okutwalibwa ng'ababadde balinako ekibiina kye bawagira oba omu ku abo abeesibyewo gwe babadde bawagira.
Whether in trees or on the road, campaign posters provide insight and at times, a good laugh.	Ebifaananyi by'abeesimbyewo ka bibe ku miti oba ku nguudo birina kye biyamba okutegeera ate oluusi bisesa busesa.
Should being a critic of the government give politicians a green card to break the law?	Okuvumirira gavumenti kiwa ebbeetu abo abeesimbyewo okumenya amateeka?
Some of these achievements include the following.	Ebimu ku ebyo bye batuuseeko bizingiramu bino wammanga:
In education, the government has done a lot.	Gavumenti ekoze nnyo mu by'enjigiriza.
Higher institutions of learning have increased from one to twenty.	Amasomero g'obuyigirize obwa waggulu geeyongedde obungi okuva ku limu okutuuka ku makumi abiri.
For example, real Gross domestic product. 	Ng'ekyokulabirako, ebintu ebyetaagisibwa mu bulamu obwa bulijjo.
The seriousness should be reflected in the media.	Bye bakola birina okulabikira ku mikuttu gy'eby'empuliziganya.
That she said the soldiers she has, are not trained.	Yagamba nti amaggye g'alina si matendeke bulungi.
Soldiers have started eating ducks.	Amaggye gatandise okulya ssente.
Action taken fourth division order title opinion and concerned district officers were informed.	Abakulu mu bitundu n'abakungu mu disitulikiti baategezebwa.
This was after he asked for the where abouts of other commanders.	Kino kyakolebwa oluvannyuma lw'okubuuza amayitire g'abaduumizi.
What challenges do you face?	Kusoomooza ki kw'oyolekaganye nakwo?
One of our biggest challenge is getting our raw material for brewing malt.	Okumu ku kusoomooza kwe twolekaganya nakwo kwe kufuna ebikozesebwa mu kusoggola omwenge.
The government has put in place an effective health policy which requires every citizen to have subscription to a health insurance.	Gavumenti ekoze enteekateeka ennaasobozesa buli muntu okuba ne yinsuwa y'obulamu.
Supported by their lobbies in western capitals.	Ng'eyambibwako ab'emikwano mu nsi ez'ebweru.
He cannot manage to stay with the people because of the crimes he committed in the area.	Tasobola kubeera wamu n'abantu abalala olw'emisango gye yazza mu kitundu.
Well knowing that they will be haunted and they will find it difficult to mix up in the society.	Olw'okukimanya nti bajja kuyigganyizibwa era nga tekijja kubabeerera kyangu kubeera wamu n'abantu abalala.
How do you start your day?	Olunaku lwo olutandika otya?
How will the population increase affect food security?	Okweyongerayongera kw'abantu kinnakola ki ku bungi bw'emmere?
The current population growth rate is three point two percent compared to the world’s average of one point two percent.	Okweyongerayongera mu bungi bw'abantu kuli ebitundu 3.2 ku buli kikumi bw'ogeraageranya n'okweyongerayongera kw'obungi bw'abantu mu nsi yonna okuli ekitundu 1.2 ku buli kikumi.
For instance having a skilled and inspired population in farming would have an unfading positive impact on the agriculture sector.	Ng'ekyokulabirako, okubeera n'abalimi abatendekeddwa obulungi era nga baagala kye bakola kijja kuba kya muganyulo nnyo mu by'obulimi.
This is true for other sectors of the economy.	Era bwe kityo bwe kirina okuba ne ku bitongole ebirala mu by'enfuna by'eggwanga.
Climate change is a challenge to businesses.	Embeera y'obudde ekyukakyuka kusoomooza kwa maanyi nnyo eri busineesi.
With every tool available to the international community, including bed nets, indoor residual spraying and top quality drugs.	Abantu mu nsi yonna balina okuba n'ebyetaagisa nga mu bino mwe muli obuttimba bw'ensiri, eddagala erifuuyiri ebiwuka mu mayumba n'eddagala eddungi erikozesebwa mu bulamu.
Those for tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, hepatitis B, polio and measles.	Eddagala lya tetenasi, ely'ekiziyiiro, ery'okukolola, ery'endwadde z'ekibumba, poliyo ne lukusense.
A malaria vaccine may be used together with the existing malaria control and immunization programmes.	Eddagala erigema omusujja gw'ensiri liyinza okukozesebwa awamu n'enteekateeka eriwo mu kiseera kino ey'okujjanjjabamu omusujja gw'ensiri awamu n'okugema.
It is also opening up its library of compounds of potential malaria drugs for researchers anywhere in the world to pursue.	Era wajja kubaawo enteekateeka ekolebwa awantu wonna mu nsi okusobozesa abakugu okunoonyereza ku ddagala ly'omusujja gw'ensiri.
Change the equation in the fight against malaria for good.	Wabeewo enteekateeka ekolebwa okulwanyisa omusujja gw'ensiri obutaddamu kubaawo.
Sweets worth twenty two point five million shillings, cosmetics worth ten million shillings, tinned beef worth four point nine million shillings and food supplements worth six point five million shillings.	Swiiti ng'aweza obukadde abiri mu bubiri n'ekitundu, ebizigo ebiweza obukadde kkumi, ennyama y'omu bikebe eweza obukadde buna mu emitwalo kyenda n'ebiriisa ebirala ebiweza obukadde mukaaga mu emitwalo attaano.
They are for cleaning re-useable bottles in the beverage and alcohol industry.	Bikozesebwa mu kwoza amakyuppa agaba gakozeeko agateekebwamu eby'okunywa mu makolero.
It blames the practice on the multiplication of small manufacturing units in homes turned into factories.	Kino kikolebwa nnyo mu makolero amatonotono mangi agali mu maka g'abantu kinnoomu.
There is no way you can enter a person’s home to inspect to find out whether there is any packaging or manufacturing taking place.	Tewaliiwo ngeri yonna gy'oyinza kugenda mu maka g'omuntu okulaba obanga mulimu ekkolero.
These are powder milk, juices, tooth paste, bathing soaps, detergents, edible oil, ladies cosmetics, medicinal syrups, and wines.	Bino bizingiramu amata g'obuwunga, eby'okunywa, eddagala ly'amannyo, ssabuuni, buto, ebizigo, sirapu n'emyenge.
This is because of weak trade regulations and flooding of the so-called investors who have turned into retail traders.	Kino kiri bwe kityo olw'amateeka g'eby'obusuubuzi amanafu n'abo abeeyita abasigansimbi abeeyongedde obungi.
He blamed fake investors for some of the forged and substandard goods.	Yanenya abasigansimbi ab'ebikyupuli olw'okukola ebintu ebitatuukana na mutindo n'okukopperera eby'abalala.
Corruption is a serious issue that should be handled with a brutal sense of urgency.	Obuli bw'enguzi bulina okukolebwako n'amaanyi mangi ate mu bwangu ddala.
This is through sensitising our members on bidding processes, supporting good purchasing processes, equity in taxation systems, and administration and good tendering processes.	Kino kirina okukolebwa okuyitira mu kusomesa abantu baffe ebikwata ku kufuna tenda, okuwagira engeri ennungi ey'okugulamu ebintu, n'okuba n'amazima mu by'emisolo era ne mu ngeri y'okuddukanyaamu emirimu.
Before we look at the region, the focus should be on creating a critical number of skilled labour necessary to transform our country.	Nga tetunnatunuulira kitundu kyaffe, essira tusaanidde okulissa ku kufuna abantu abalina obukugu okusobola okuleetawo enkulaakulana mu nsi yoffe.
Like garage operators, spanner boys, saloon operators and, metal fabricators.	Okufaananako abo abakola mu malongosezzo g'emmottoka, abavubuka abaweereza bamakanika, abo abakola mu ssaaluuni, n'abaweesi.
It has remained constantly poor, leading to weak state of the agriculture sector.	Ensi yaffe esigadde njavu ekiviiriddeko eby'obulimu obutaba birungi.
Resolve the issue of land policy to guarantee ownership and user rights of land by farmers.	Mukole ku kizibu ekikwata ku tteeka ly'ettaka abantu basobole okuba n'obwannanyini ku ttaka.
From right inputs to correct production systems, value addition processing and marketing.	Okuviira ddala ku bikozesebwa ebituufu, enkola ennungi, omutindo omulungi n'akatale.
Transformation in real terms of our country.	Enkulaakulana etuukagana obulungi n'ensi yaffe.
They supported the ascendance to power of civilian groups  which were opportunistic and incapable of holding the country together.	Baawagira eky'abantu aba bulijjo bannakigwanyizi okujja mu buyinza ate nga tebalina busobozi bwa kutereeza nsi.
It is an obvious misconception to argue that liberal democracy gives birth to liberal democracy.	Si kituufu kugamba nti demokulasiya aleeta demokulasiya.
Foreign interference was to keep back the evolution of a militarily strong organisation that could establish order in the country.	Amaggye amagwiira gaalina ekigendererwa eky'okukuumira emmabega enkyukakyuka ezandireeteddwa eggye ery'amaanyi eryandisobodde okuzzaawo emirembe mu
The state of affairs favoured weak and incompetent warlords.	Embeera eyaliwo yali yeetaagisa eggye ennafu era nga teririna bumanyirivu.
However, nothing short of death can stop human initiative.	Ekintu kyonna nga si kufa, tekiyinza kulemesa muntu kubaako ky'akola.
It organised around a unifying ideology of Islam and began implementing Sharia law.	Kyakola enteekateeka okusinziira ku ndowooza y'ekisiraamu ey'obumu era ne kitandika okussa mu nkola amateeka ga Sharia.
I was struck by how profound his insights on the subject were.	Nneewunya nnyo amagezi ge yalina ku nsonga eno.
He argued that external actors tend to distort local politics by creating artificial winners and artificial losers.	Yagamba nti abagwiira boonoona eby'obufuzi bw'ensi nga bassaawo abawanguzi n'abawangulibwa.
Support from foreign forces makes the  winner lack incentives to seek internal political integration domestically hoping to rely on foreign allies .	Okufuna obuyambi okuva eri abagwiira kireetera abawanguzi okulemererwa okukozesa eby'obufuzi eby'omunda okugatta abantu ne basalawo okwesigama ku bagwiira.
Democracy exists in stable and effective states, not in anarchy	Demokulasiya abaawo mu nsi omuli obutebenkevu so si omuli entalo.
The challenge, however, was how to inform the public without creating unnecessary alarm.	Kyokka okusoomoozebwa okwaliwo kwali kwekuusa ku ngeri y'okutegeezaamu abantu nga tobaleetedde kukuba miranga.
Monday, the director of counter terrorism	Monday akulira okulwanyisa ebikolwa by'ekitujju
However, the memo noted that as Muslims, the youths were upset.	Kyokka, ekiwandiiko kyagamba nti ng'Abasiraamu, abavubuka tebaali basanyufu.
“This should not be underestimated or (not) taken seriously because these are practicing Muslim youths who regularly meet at least five times a day for prayers	Kino tekisaanidde kubuusibwamu maaso oba okutwalibwa ng'ekikulu kubanga bano abavubuka Basiraamu abasaba entakera emirundi ettaano buli lunaku.
They were not released until four years later	Tebaateebwa okutuusa nga wayiseewo emyaka ena.
These betrayed promises increased disgruntlement	Ebisuubizo bino ebitaatuukirizibwa byayongera okuleeta obutali bumativu.
They knew of their internal structures, their operational plans, the names, home addresses and car number-plates of security operatives	Baali bamanyi enteekateeka zaabwe ez'omunda, enkola yaabwe, amannya, gye bava, ne nnamba z'emmottoka ez'ab'eby'okwerinda.
The challenge therefore was not lack of information but rather how to operationalise it.	N'olwekyo ekizibu tekyali nti bali tebamanyi kya kukola wabula engeri y'okukikolamu.
This theory is based on the discovery of two sliced heads of the suspected suicide bombers at both sites.	Bino byonna byesigamizibwa ku ebyo ebyazuulibwa ku mitwe ebiri egyabetentebwa ejja abasajja abasuubirwa okuba nga be baatulisa bbomu mu bifo ebyo byombi.
The identities of the suicide bombers have not yet been established.	Abantu abo ababiri abatulisa bbomu tebannamanyika.
These warlords began to control small pockets of the country from whom they could rip a small fortune.	Abalwanyi bano batandika okwezza ebitundu ebimu mu ggwanga gye baali bayinza okubaako kye bafuna.
quietly despising him for clinging to power and presiding over a corrupt system.	Ayisibwamu amaaso olw'okulemera mu buyinza ng'akulembera gavumenti embi.
They belonged to the Salaf and Tablique sects of Islam.	Baali ba mu kibiina ky'Abasiraamu ekya Salaf ne Tablique.
Working for security, resumption of bomb attacks against the public with interest in crowded places and to intensify recruitment with emphasis on educated citizens irrespective of religion	Nga bakolera ab'eby'okwerinda, okweyongera mu maaso n'obulumbaganyi bwabwe nga batulisa bbomu mu bantu era n'okweyongera okuyingizaamu abantu ng'essira okusingira ddala balissizza ku bantu abayigirize awatali kufaayo ku ddiini.
Under the belief they would receive amnesty, monetary compensation or getting jobs in the army and other security organisations.	Nga balowooza nti bandifunye okusonyiyibwa, okusasulwa ssente oba okufuna emirimu mu maggye ne mu bitongole ebirala eby'okwerinda.
The suicide jacket tends to destroy the middle body leaving only the head and limbs.	Bbomu ze beetulisizzaamu zitera kusanyaawo omubiri gwonna naye omutwe n'emikono ne bisigalawo.
Inside the Koran were telephone numbers which gave police important leads.	Mu Korani mwalimu ennamba z'essimu ezaayamba ennyo poliisi okumanya ebikulu.
The bomb had failed to explode the previous day.	Bbomu yali egaanye okubwattuka ku lunaku olwali luyise.
From these clues, security forces proceeded to follow up other simcards the phone had used on eleventh July.	Okusinziira ku bino, ab'eby'okwerinda baatandika okugoberera ennamba z'essimu endala ezaali zikubiddwako nga Jjulaayi 11 nga bakozesa essimu eyo.
What it shows , however is that security organisations have the right clues to track down terrorists.	Kino kiraga nti ab'eby'okwerinda balina ebituufu bye bamanyi ebisobola okubayamba okulondoola abatujju.
Nothing more was done.	Tewaliiwo kirala kyakolebwa.
Terrorists avoid the strong points and attack spots where you least expect them to.	Abatujju beewala ebifo awali obukuumi obw'amaanyi ne bagenda gye batusuubirwa.
Other intelligence sources explain that terrorists were successful because of corruption in security agencies which limited the gathering of intelligence information.	Ensonda endala zigamba nti abatujju baasobola okukola ekyo olw'obuli bw'enguzi obuli mu kitongole ky'eby'okwerinda ekyaviirako okulekera awo okukola okunoonyereza.
Operational funds are used by intelligence chiefs to enrich themselves leaving operatives without working capital.	Ssente eziteekebwa mu kitongole ky'eby'okwerinda zikozesebwa abakulu okweggagawaza kino ne kireetera abalina okukola omulimu okuba nga tebalina ssente za kukozesa.
National security has been compromised by personal enrichment.	Eby'okwerinda by'eggwanga byonooneddwa olw'okwagala okweggagawaza.
Operatives complain because they cannot justify their operations.	Abo abalina okukola emirimu beemulugunya olw'okuba tebasobola kutuukiriza mirimu gyabwe.
He introduced a system whereby every operation is clear with streamlined potential benefits.	Yassaawo enkola esobozesa buli aba akoze omulimu okufuna omuganyulo.
Most of its intelligence was technical and general in nature whereby terrorists had increased their activities.	Eby'obukeesi ebisinga obungi tebyali byangu era kino kyaleetera ebikolwa by'abatujju okweyongera obungi.
Security agencies infiltrated the communication infrastructure, flow of money and disrupted the terrorist groups.	Ebitongole ebikeesi byayingirira enteekateeka z'eby'empuliziganya, ensimbi ezikozesebwa era ne bitabulatabula ebibinja by'abatujju.
People were arrested, tortured and their release was based on money.	Abantu baakwatibwa, baatulugunyizibwa era okuteebwa kwabwe kwesigamizibwa ku ssente.
He was against detention of people without trial and against torture.	Yali avumirira nnyo eky'okusiba abantu nga tebamaze kuwozesebwa era n'eky'okubatulugunya.
He asserted that he will deal with anyone who tortured suspects.	Yakiggumizza nti ajja kukola ku muntu yenna atulugunya abalala.
People suspected of terroristic activities should be investigated efficiently and then handed over to the police.	Abo abateeberezebwa nti beenyigira mu bikolwa eby'ekitujju balina okunoonyerezebwako ekimala ate oluvannyuma bakwasibwe poliisi.
Therefore, operational funds were not increased.	N'olwekyo, ssente ezeetaagisibwa okukola omulimu tezaayongezebwako.
Most of the operations came to a standstill and old contacts were not reactivated.	Emirimu ming gyayimirira era n'egyali gikoleddwako emmabega tegyeyongera mu maaso.
Lack of funds has constrained security operations.	Ebitongole by'okwerinda biremeseddwa olw'okubulwa ssente.
Money appropriated for security operations was embezzled by the chiefs.	Ssente ezaali ziweereddwa ebitongole by'okwerinda zaabulankanyizibwa abakulu.
Rebels disguised themselves as hawkers, bodaboda riders and taxi drivers.	Bakyewaggula beefuula okuba abatunda ebintu nga babitambuza, ababodaboda, era ng'abavuzi ba takisi.
Football fans were cautioned not to engage in unsafe sexual and risky activities during the tournament.	Abazannyi b'omupiira baakubirizibwa okwewala ebikolwa by'okwegatta awamu n'ebikolwa ebirala ebitali birungi mu kiseera eky'okuzannya omupiira.
This was because of the inconsistence in the security agencies.`	Kino kyali kityo olw'obutali bulambulukufu obwali mu bitongole by'okwerinda.
The infiltrated rebel networks were replaced by new ones.	Ebibiina by'abayeekera ebyali bisanyiziddwawo byasikirwa ebirala.
The rebel group has also resorted to using women instead of men to calm suspicions.	Abayeekera kati basazeewo okukozesa abakazi mu kifo ky'okukozesa abasajja basobole okumalawo okwekengerwa.
There was elimination  of security personnel.	Ow'eby'okwerinda yaggyibwawo.
Resumption of bomb attacks against the public with interest in crowded places.	Okwongera okutulisa bbomu mu bantu nnaddala mu bifo omuli abantu abangi ennyo.
Intensify recruitment with emphasis on educated citizens irrespective of religion.	Mweyongere okuwandiisa abantu ng'essira mulissa ku abo abayigirize awatali kufaayo ku ddiini.
They however continue being false.	kyokka beeyongera okulimba.
These documents simplify their mobility and makes it difficult for the unsuspecting public to identify them as wrong elements.	Ebiwandiiko bino bibasobozesa okuva mu kifo ekimu okudda mu kirala, era kireetera abantu obutasobola kubeekengera okuba abantu ababi.
There has been a noted immigration lapse.	Okusengukasenguka kukendedde.
This is intended to make tracking by security difficult.	Kino kikoleddwa okulemesa ab'eby'okwerinda okukola okunoonyereza.
A cross-section of the public has always taken our operations as state inspired to press down on political or perceived enemies.	Abantu abamu balowooza nti gavumenti ekozesa omulimu gwaffe okunyigiriza bannabyabufuzi oba abo be balowooza nti balabe ba gavumenti.
The legal procedure borne by the telecommunication companies that demands court order to secure printouts on top of making some payments is inconveniencing and leads to unnecessary delays.	Enkola eyeesigamiziddwa ku mateeka eyatandikibwawo kampuni z'amasimu nga zaagala kkooti okufuna lisiiti okusobola okubaako bye basasula, si nnungi era eviirako okulwa.
They are difficult to monitor.	Bizibu okulabirira.
The threat is very imminent.	Obuzibu obwo bulina okubaawo
It calls for boldness and vigilance where each member of society should be security conscious of his or her own security.	Kiba kyetaagisa okuba omuvumu era omwegendereza nga buli muntu yeekuuma.
Since it transcends borders, then it calls for collective effort.	Okuva bwe kituuka n'ebunaayira, kiba kitegeeza nti balina okukolera awamu.
With the switch to ethanol-based fuel, there came a side effect that had not been anticipated. 	Bwe baatandika okukola amafuta aga ethanol, waliwo ebirala ebitali birungi ebyavaamu ate nga tebyasuubirwa.
The high-stakes game of real-life, monopoly is leading to a modern colonialism to which many poor countries submit out of necessity.	Okusinziira ku ebyo ebibaawo mu bulamu obwa bulijjo, okwefuga ebintu kiviiriddeko enkola ey'obufuzi bw'amatwale obw'ekiseera kino era nga ensi nnyingi enkuseere ziraga obuwulize olw'obwetaavu bwe zirina.
Militant Islamist groups are determined to spread their activities into every corner of the world from attacks.	Ebibiina by'abalwanyi Abasiraamu bimalirivu okubunyisa enkola yaabwe mu buli kanyomero k'ensi.
The third part will run in the next edition.	Ekitundu eky'okusatu kijja kufulumira mu kitundu ekiddako.
Responses to the article by Rwandans leave nothing to the imagination regarding what they think of him.	Ebyo ebyayogerwa ku kiwandiiko ky'Abanyarwanda bireetera abantu okuleekera awo okuteebereza ku ekyo ky'alowooza.
The furious reactions should not surprise.	Tebasaanidde kwewunya olw'enneeyisa eyo eyoleka obukambwe.
Those who know him well are aware of how clingy he holds on to his views, valid or not.	Abo abamumanyi bamanyi bulungi engeri gy'alemera ku ndowooza ye k'ebe ntuufu oba nkyamu.
Be that as it may, there are issues he raises that merit careful consideration.	Wadde nga kiri bwe kityo, waliwo ensonga z'ayogerako ezirina okulowoozebwako ennyo.
And in its abnormality lie the reasons why it should not be assessed on the basis of conventional criteria.	Wadde nga tekiri mu mbeera nnungi, kiyinza obuteetaagisa kwogerwako mu ngeri egudde olubege.
It had no civil service, no police, no health service and, perhaps more frightening, no source of income.	Teryalina bakozi, poliisi, malwaliro era oboolyawo n'ekisinga obubi ennyingiza mu by'ensimbi.
For years, donors, believing that the new government would not last, with held assistance.	Okumala emyaka, abagabirizi b'obuyambi babadde balowooza nti gavumenti empya tejja kuwangaala olw'okusalibwako obuyambi.
Their defected comrades are now working with security.	Bannaabwe abaawanduka mu lwokaano kati bakolera wamu n'ab'eby'okwerinda.
The rest of the public believe that it is a religious persecution.	Abantu abalala bonna balowooza nti bayigganyizibwa lwa ddiini.
There is low rainfall and sources of fresh ground water are drying up and arable farm land is becoming scarce.	Enkuba ntono era n'enzizzi zitandise okukalira era n'aw'okulimira tewakyamala.
Prices rose as farmers turned from growing maize for human and animal consumption to growing it for profitable car fuel market.	Emiwendo gyalinnya olw'okuba abalimi baalekera awo okulima kasooli ow'emmere n'ow'okuliisa ebisolo ne batandika okulima ow'okukolamu amafuta.
Millions of people in the developing world were in danger of slipping back into absolute poverty, spending up to 65 percent of their income on food.	Abantu bukadde na bukadde abali mu nsi ezikyakula baali mu kabi okukudda mu bunkuseere, era bano basaasaanya ssente ze bafuna ebitundu nkaaga mu bitaano ku buli kikumi mu kuguala eby'okulya.
This will lead to significantly increasing transportation costs and so raising the price of such critical commodities as oil.	Kino kijja kulinyisa nnyo emiwendo gy'eby'entambula kiviireko n'eby'amaguzi ng'amafuta okulinnya ebbeeyi.
suddenly every part of the world has become important in military and counter terrorism terms.	Mu bwangu ddala, buli kanyomero konna ak'ensi kalina okutwala eby'ekijaasi okuba ekintu ekikulu ennyo era n'okwerinda ebikolwa eby'ekitujju.
They used it to feed the very people who had executed the genocide.	Baabikozesa okuliisa abantu abo bennyini abeenyigira mu kittabantu.
If we don’t do something it will hurt all of us.	Bwe tutabaako kye tukolawo, ffenna tujja kukosebwa.
We also need to start thinking about new tools, including a malaria vaccine, which could complement existing interventions.	Era tulina okutandika okulowooza ku birala eby'okukozesa nga mw'otwalidde okugema omusujja gw'ensiri, era kino kiyinza okuyambako enkola eriwo mu kiseera kino.
Vaccines and immunization services have been critical to improving Africa’s health over the last several decades.	Okugema kuyambye nnyo mu kutereeza obulamu bw'abantu mu Afirica okumala emyaka mingi egiyise.
There are only few of us who have not directly been affected by the disease but anyone whose child has suffered from malaria can imagine what a malaria vaccine would mean.	Tuli batono nnyo abatannakwatibwa bulwadde obwo naye omuntu yenna alina omwana eyali akwatiddwa omusujja gw'ensiri amanyi nga bwe kiri ekikulu okufuna eddagala erigema omusujja gw'ensiri.
Several years ago, when I started working in pharmaceuticals, a malaria vaccine was only a distant dream.	Emyaka mingi egiyise we nnatandikira okukola ng'omusawo agaba eddagala, kyali tekirowoozeka nti eddagala erigema omusujja gw'ensiri lisobola okufunika.
The vaccine candidate is approaching the end of a long journey.	Tunaatera okufuna eddagala eryo.
Policymakers will need to design a policy structure and strengthen health systems.	Abo abakola amateeka kijja kubeetaagisa okussaawo enkola enneegobererwa era ennenyweza eby'obulamu.
This means everything from improving infrastructure and delivery systems to training healthcare workers to administer a new vaccine.	Kino kiba kizingiramu byonna okuviira ddala ku kutereeza enkola egobererwa, enkola ey'okubitambuza, n'okutendeka abasawo okusobola okugema.
These efforts can build upon work that is already underway for other new tools, such as rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccines.	Bino biyinza okwongerezebwa ku ebyo ebiriwo mu kiseera kino okusobola okufuna ebikozesebwa ebirala, gamba nga eddagala erigema eriyitibwa rotavirus ne pneumococcal.
Partners need to get involved.	N'abantu abalala balina okwenyigiramu.
The chemicals involved are mostly bought by the small companies in soft drink and alcohol business.	Ebiragalalagala ebikozesebwa bigulibwa okusingira ddala amakolero amatono agakola eby'okunywa.
The health danger to the consumer of such expired chemicals is that the active ingredients become inactive.	Kino kisobola okubeera eky'akabi eri obulamu bw'abo ababikozesa.
He warns that the most affected products on the list of expired consumer goods.	Awa okulabula ku bimu ku bintu ebyo bye balina ku lukalala ebiyinza okuba nga byayitako.
We need more money to be able to deepen awareness more effectively.	Twetaaga ssente ezimala okusobola okunyikizza okuyigiriza kwaffe eri abantu nga tubalabula.
We would want police to confiscate commodities which they suspect to be expired and then call us.	Twagala poliisi ebowe ebintu ebiteeberezebwa okuba nga byayitako era batuyite.
We want it to get to that point where people should not only get arrested for criminals because it is under the Police Act.	Twagala kituuke ku ssa eryo nga tekikoma bukomi ku kukwata bantu olw'okuzza emisango kubanga kiri mu mateeka agafuga Poliisi.
“Because of weak regulation, when they are arrested they pay the fine and return to business,” he said. 	"Yagamba nti olw'amateeka amanafu, abantu bwe bakwatibwa basasula ssente ne beddirayo okukola emirimu gyabwe."""
Stricter new laws could help.	Amateeka amakakali gayinza okuyambako.
Impacts of corruption are destructive for both private and public sectors.	Ebyo ebiva mu buli bw'enguzi bikosa bonna.
I think two of the major solutions to corruption are to strengthen moral value systems.	Nze ndowooza nti ebintu bibiri ku ebyo ebisinga obukulu ebiyinza okuyamba mu kulwanyisa obuli bw'enguzi kwe kuyamba abantu okuba n'empisa ennungi.
Most private sector entrepreneurs in Uganda lack information, how can this be overcome for them to go into public private partnerships?	Abasuubuzi bangi mu Uganda balina ekizibu eky'obutaba na kumanya, bayinza batya okuyambibwa?
We are developing an integrated communication system that will allow feedforward and feedback delivery of business information.	Tulina enkola ey'eby'empuliziganya gye tukola enneetusobozesa okumanya ebibafaako nabo okumanya ebitukwatako.
Our efforts will tap into unity of other private and public agencies engaged in brokerage of business information.	Okufuba kwaffe kujja kusobozesa abalala abakola busineesi okufuna okumanya okwetaagisa.
Skilled labour or human capital is key software for a country to develop and maintain development.	Abantu abakola obulungi emirimu bamugaso nnyo eri enkulaakulana y'ensi.
The issue of skilled labour is historical and has to be resolved through fair and complete change options.	Ensonga eno ekwata ku bakozi abalina obukugu si ya kakati era kino kirina okutereezebwa okuyitira mu nkola ennuŋŋamu.
This action will restore their confidence and allow their availability in the expansive labour market provided by the Common Market.	Enkola eno ejja kubaleetera okuba nga tebeetya era ejja kubasobozesa okwenyigira mu mirimu gyonna eginnabaawo.
This is happening at a time when the country is experiencing unsual population with a high fertility rate.	Kino kituukidde mu kiseera ng'eggwanga lyeyongeddemu abantu olw'okuba bazaala nnyo.
Where food production fails to match or exceed population growth you have terrible food insecurity as a result.	Emmere bw'eba nga ntono ku bantu abali mu ggwanga, awo ab'olina ekizibu kya maanyi.

Sebaggala denied he had crossed to National Resistance Movement  four years ago.	Sebaggala yagaana okukkiriza nti yasala eddiiro n'adda mu kibiina kya National Resistance Movement emyaka ena emabega
But in any case, what is wrong with cooperating with Museveni and the NRM? 	Naye kikyamu ki ekiri mu kukolagana ne Museveni n'ekibiina kya NRM?
Did they want me to be like Ssebaana who spent most of his time as mayor trading words with Museveni?	Baali baagala mbeerenga Ssebaana eyamala ebiseera bye byonna ng'awanyisaganya ebigambo ne Museveni?
Sebaggala stood for the Democratic Party  presidency during the party’s Delegates Conference in Mbale in February this year, but lost to Norbert Mao.	Sebaggala yeesimbawo okulondebwa nga pulezidenti w'Ekibiina kya DP mu ttabamiruka w'ekibiina e Mbale mu Febwali omwaka guno naye Norbert Mao n'amuwangula
Party members who attended the Mbale conference say the money Sebaggala was dishing out before and during the conference aroused suspicion about the source	Bannakibiina abaaliwo mu lukuŋŋana e Mbale bagamba nti sente Sebaggala ze yagaba ng'olukuŋŋaana terunatandika era nga lugenda mu maaso, zeewuunyisa nnyo abantu wa gye yazigya
They say that during private meetings with DP members, Sebaggala would often talk about striking  a power sharing deal with Museveni	Bagamba nti bwe yasisinkananga bamemba b'Ekibiina kya DP, Sebaggala yayogeranga ku ky'okugabana obuyinza ne Museveni
It was strange that he was talking about doing business with Museveni if he failed to get a fifty one percent majority in the coming elections	Kyewuunyisa okuba nti yali ayogera ku kukola bizineensi ne Museveni singa alemwa okufuna ebitundu ataano ku kikumi mu kulonda okujja
Sources say that Sebaggala provided some of the mattresses for the delegates	Abamu bangamba nti Sebaggala yawa abamu ku bagenyi emifaliso
They wondered how the UPDF could have released its mattresses to facilitate an opposition conference unless someone high in government was interested in Sebaggala taking the Democratic Party presidency	Beewuunya engeri UPDF gye yawaayo emifaliso gyayo okuvujjirira olukuŋŋaana lw'abo bali ku ludda oluvuganya okugyako nga waliwo omukungu okuva mu gavumenti awagira Sebaggala okufuuka pulezidenti w'Ekibiina kya DP
This has impelled observers to say Sebaggala had long planned to hand over DP to Museveni and the NRM, but his mission was thwarted by the defeat at the Mbale conference	Kino kyawaliriza abalaba ebigenda mu maaso okugamba nti Sebaggala amaze ekiseera ng'akola entegeka okuwaayo ekibiina kya DP eri Museveni ne NRM, naye ekigenderwa kye kyagwa butaka mu lukuŋŋaana olwali e Mbale
The NRM has celebrated Sebaggala’s arrival	NRM yasanyukira okujja kwa Sebaggala
NRM spokesperson, Mary Karooro Okurut wrote: “Sebaggala is one of those few people in Uganda who are a little more than just individuals.	"Omwogezi w'ekibiina kya NRM, Mary Karooro Okurut yawandiika nti: ""Sebaggala y'omu ku bantu abatono mu Uganda asukkulumako kato ku bantu kinnoomu"
Mabikke dismissed the assessment as an  overestimation of Sebaggala’s popularity.	Mabikke yasambajja ekya Sebaggala okuba omututumufu
It has already been killed by a weed,” Mabikke said.	Mabikke yagamba nti omuddo gumaze okukitta
Mabikke says that NRM falsely believes that Sebaggala is the weapon they will deploy to rout the opposition and recapture Kampala	Mabikke agamba nti ekibiina kya NRM kyerimbalimba nti Sebaggala ky'ekyokulwanyisa kye bajja okukozesa okusaanyaawo oludda oluvuganya n'okuddamu okuwamba Kampala
Opposition FDC candidate Dr Kizza Besigye received 245,004 votes, which translate into over 50% of the total votes cast	Eyesimbawo ku ludda oluvuganya ow'ekibiina kya FDC Dr Kizza Besigye yafuna obululu 245,004 nga bino bye bitundu ataano ku buli kikumu ku bululu bwonna obwakubibwa
Democratic Party candidate Ssebaana Kizito got 11,993 votes, Abed Bwanika 3,045 votes and Miria Obote 1,425	Eyesimbawo mu Kibiina kya DP Ssebaana Kizito yafuna obululu 11,993, Abed Bwanika 3,045 Miria Obote 1,425
Museveni scored 170,688 votes.	Museveni yafuna obululu 170,688
If the 2006 electoral statistics are anything to go by, Sebaggala cannot deliver Kampala to the NRM	Singa ebyava mu kulonda mu 2006 bye bikozesebwa, Sebaggala tayinza kuwaayo Kampala eri ekibiina kya NRM
How long did he stay with the Progressive Democratic Party?	Mu kibiina kya Progressive Democratic Party yamalamu bbanga ki?
"""How long did he stay with LDP before he ran to the NRM?” Kezaala wonders"	"Kezaala agamba nti, ""yamala bbanga ki mu kibiina kya LDP nga tannagenda mu NRM?"""
Mabikke says that all Kampala Division Chairpersons except Godfrey Nyakana and all MPs except Freddie Ruhindi, were key mobilisers and planners in Sebaggala’s 2006 campaigns, but have since fallen out with him.	Mabikke agamba nti Basentebe bonna mu Kampala okugyako Godfrey Nyakana era n'ababaka ba palimenti bonna okugyako Freddie Ruhindi, baali basaale mu kunoonyezza Sebaggala akalulu mu 2006, naye okuva olwo, tebakolagana naye
He supports the claim that Sebaggala cannot win an election on his own.	Akiriziganya n'ekigambibwa nti Sebaggala tayinza kuwangula okulonda ku lulwe yekka
Senior researcher at Makerere Institute of Social Research, Golooba Mutebi, also believes Sebaggala will not add any political value to the NRM.	Omukugu mu kunoonyereza okuva e Makerere Institute of Social Research, Golooba Mutebi, naye akkiriza nti Sebaggala talina kintu kyonna kya byabufunzi ekiyinza okuyamba NRM
“History will judge us,” Sebaggala said defiantly.	"Sebaggala yakyogera kaati nti ""Ebyafaayo bijja kutulamula"""
His first election as mayor in 1997 was based on his DP membership and his participation in 1996 presidential campaigns for the joint candidate of Inter Political Forces Cooperation.	Omulundu gwe ogwasooka okulondebwa ku bwa meeya mu 1997 kwesigama ku kuba nti yali wa kibiina kya DP n'okunoonya akalulu k'obwapulezidenti okw'oyo eyali yeggase ne banne eyali ow'ekibiina kya Plitico Force Cooeration
In 2001 Sebaggala supported Besigye who was standing under the Reform Agenda flagship.	Mu 2001 Sebaggala yawagira Besigye eyali owa Reform Agend
At that time the NRM ridiculed Besigye as unfit for a national leader for allying with a convicted fraudster yet he was purporting to fight corruption in government.	yali mukumpanya naye yali awagira okulwanyisa obuli bw'enguzi mu gavumenti
It’s now the same NRM that is applauding Sebaggala as a big political catch that will boost the party’s support in 2011.	Kati ekibiina kya NRM kye kimu ekitendereza Sebaggala nga munnabyabufuzi ajja okutuumbula obuwagizi bw'ekibiina mu 2011
The problem of double registration in Uganda in the voters’ register has been teasing the Electoral Commission for last three elections.	Ekizibu ky'okuwandiika abalonzi emirundi ebiri mu Uganda kubadde kusoomo kw'amaanyi eri Akakiiko k'Eby'okulanda mu kulonda kwa mirundi esatu emabega
Pontius Namugera you have so far identified 150,000 double registrations; does that mean you have cleared the voter register by 150,000?	Pontius Namugera ozudde amanya 150,000 agawandiikiddwa emirundi ebiri; kino kitegeeza nti osangudde amanya 150,000 mu nkalala z'abalonzi?
Kalisa’s latest project is to invite bids from fuel operators to manage the national fuel reserves at Jinja in spite of an earlier agreement with Tamoil to manage the same facility as part of the KenyaUganda petroleum products pipeline.	Kati omulimu gwa Kalisa kwe kunoonya abakozi b'amafuta okuddukanya amaterekero g'amafuta ag'e Jinja wadde nga waaliwo endagaano eyakolebwa ne kampuni ya Tamoil okukola mu kifo ekyo ng'ekitundu ky'omuddumu gw'amafuta ogwa Kenya ne Uganda
The reserves on Mutibwa Road in Jinja now stand dry and empty with no one to manage them.	Amaterekero agali ku oluguudo lwa Mulibwa e Jinja kati makalu era meerere tewali agalalabirira
The bid document indicates that the procurement method for the bid is Open International Bidding, however, in his usual opaque operations style, Kalisa is keeping a tight lid on any information despite a mandatory right to such information by the public.	Ekiwanddiko ekisabirwako buli omu ayagala ekintu kiraga nti enkola eno ya Nsi Yonna, naye mu nkola ye eya bulijjo, Kalisa takiriza kintu kyonna kumayika wadde ng'abantu baddembe okubaako kye bamanya
The Ministry of Energy decision on how to manage the oil reserves is supposed to be approved by parliament but MP Fred Bukeni Gyabi, who is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Natural Resources, says he is not aware of any such bidding and is hearing it from the press.	Okusalawo kwa Ministry of Energy ku ngeri y'okuddukanyamu amaterekero amafuta erina kulina kukolebwa palimenti naye omubaka wa palimenti, Fred Bukeni Gyabi, Ssentebe w'Akakiiko ka Palamenti ak'Eby'Obugagga ebyomu Butonde, agamba nti talina kyamanyi ku kusaba okwo era akuwulira mu mpapula z'amawulire
Kalisa’s latest venture is not the first time the ministry is reaching out for bidders to manage the facility.	ebizimbe
In 2008 President Museveni said the government’s maintenance of the fuel reserves would unnecessarily tie up public monies.	Mu 2008 pulezidenti Museveni yagamba nti gavumenti okuddukanya amaterekero g'amafuta kiyinza okusiba sente za gavumenti
MP Gyabi wonders how the ministry can award a contract to another bidder when they are already in contract with another company	Omubaka wa palamenti Gyabi yeewuunya engeri ekitongole gye kiyinza okuwa omulimu kampuni esaba ng'ate yamaladda okukolagana ne kampuni endala
Observers say that Kalisa’s ministry seems to be playing games as its offers are on and off.	Abantu bagamba nti ekitongole kya Kalisa kiri mu muzannyo buzannyo, tekisagasagana
However, like many other critics, Parliamentary Energy Committee Chairman Gyabi insists that “the reserves are so critical; they should be a preserve of government,” he says, “that responsibility can not be left to private oriented players.	"Kyokka, okufaananako abakolokosi abalala, Sentebe w'Akakiiko ka  Palamenti ak'Amasanyalaze Gyabi agamba nti ""amaterekero mabi nnyo; gavumenti ye yandibadde egakuuma,"" agamba nti, ""obuvunaanyizibwa tebuyinza kulekerwa balala."
Some experts disagree with Gyabi.	Abakugu abamu tebakkiriziganya na Gyabi
Critics say the failures of Kalisa’s ministry stem from its failure to be transparent, poor planning and poor negotiation skills of its officials.	Abakolokosi bagamba nti okugwa kw'ekitongole kya Kalisa kusibuka okukulemwe okuba omwerufu, entegeka embi n'entesaganya embi

Last week, during a closed session meeting in Entebbe with UN Security Council envoys, President Museveni reportedly said that Uganda is willing to pay any price, including jeopardising relations with Omar alBashir’s National Congress Party, to ensure the secession of the South if they vote for independence	Wiiki ewedde, mu lukungaana olwali Entebe ng'asisinkanye n'Olukiiko olw'eby'Okwerinda olw'ekibiikak ky'Amawanga Amagatte Pulezidenti Museveni yakiddingaana nti Uganda yali nnetegefu okuwaayo sente, nga mwotwalidde n'okugyawo enkolagana n'ekibiina kya Omar alBashir ekya National Congress, n'okukakasa nti Ekitudu ky'Obukiikaddyo kifuna obwetwaze bwe balonda eky'okufuna obwetwaze

Michael ezra: Uganda’s wanted man Police continue to hunt Mike Ezra over charges resulting from a false cheque worth $550,000 he had issued to Dr Charles Mushabe, a software engineer, and his brother Frank Katusiime, an IT consultant	Michael Ezra: Uganda gw'enoonya, Poliisi yeeyongera okunoonya Micheal Ezra, olw'emisango gyokuwa Dr Charles Mushabe ceeke ey'ebicupuli eya ddoola 550,000 enginiya wa kompyuta, ne muganda we Frank Katusiime, kakensa eyebuziibwako owa IT

Ezra reportedly issued the false cheque after he convinced the pair to loan him the money so he could set up a joint venture in the city centre	Ezera emirundi egyomuddingana bombi yabawa ceeke ez'ebicupuli oluvanyuma lw'okubamatiza okumuwola ssente okusobola okutandikawo bizineensi wakati mu kibuga
Ezra reportedly promised to refund the money after a week and provided the brothers with a postdated cheque as a guarantee he would return the money	Ezera yabasuubiza okubaddiza sente mu wiiki emu era ab'oluganda abo yabawa akakalu ka ceeke eyayitako ennaku
They allege Ezra had ordered the bank not to cash the cheque, which prompted them to report the incident to police	Ezera yalagira banka obutabawa sente, ekyabaviirako okuwaaba ku poliisi
Worrying that his image could be in jeopardy, Ezra called an impromptu press briefing at Emin Pasha Hotel in Kampala where he displayed what he says was $3 million worth of cash before journalists	Olw'okweraliikirira okuba mu kabi, Ezera yatuuza bannamawulira mu Pasha Hotel mu Kampala gye yabalagira ekyo kye yagamba nti zaali obukadde bwa ddoola 3
The stunt, however, stroked the ire of the authorities who were already seeking Ezra’s detainment over outstanding debts of Shs 1.21.6 billion to the Uganda Revenue Authority for unpaid income tax and Shs 400 million to the National Bank of Commerce over an outstanding loan	Kabi kano kanyiiza nnyo ab'obuyinza abaali banoony Ezera okumusiba olw'ebanja ly'Ekitongole kya Uganda Revenue Authority ly'obuwuumbi 1.21.6 obwa siringi olw'obutasasula musolo era n'ebbanja lya bukadde 400 obwa siringi erya National Bank of Commerce
On October 8, in a telephone interview with the Daily Monitor, Ezra claimed that his $500,000 cheque to Katusiime bounced because the URA froze transactions on all his accounts, not because he was insolvent	Nga 8 Okutoba nga boogerea ku ssimu n'abolupapula wa Daily Monitor, Ezera ceeke ye eya ddoola 500,000 gye yawa Katusiime teyayitamu kubanga URA yali yassa envubo ku akawunta ze, naye si lwakuba nti yali tayalina sente

Court stops besigye’s double trial The Forum for Democratic Change President Dr Kizza Besigye and ten others are now partially relieved after the Constitutional Court ruled that their trial on treason in different courts was unconstitutional	Kooti yagaana Pulezidenti w'Ekibiina kya The Forum for Democratic Change Dr Kizza Besigyeera n'abalala kkumi okuwozesebwa emirundi ebiri era kati bafunyeeko akalembereza oluvannyuma lwa Kooti ya Mateeka okusalawo nti okuwozesebwa kwabwe ku musango gw'okulya mu nsi olukwe oguli mu kooti ez'enjawulo tegukwatagana na semateeka
Besigye and his coaccused have been on trial for treason in the High Court and on a parallel trial on terrorism in the court martial since 2005 when he returned from exile	Besigye ne banne babadde mu Kooti ya Ssemateeka nga bawoza omusango ogw'okulya mu nsi olukwe mu kiseera kye kimu nga bawoza omusango gw'obuttujju mu kkooti y'amagye okuva lwe yakomawo mu buwanganguse 2005
The judges agreed with Besigye’s lawyer David Mpanga that by prosecuting the suspects in both the civil and military court the state had subjected the accused to double jeopardy and caused them psychological torture	Abalamuzi bakkiriziganya ne looya wa Besigye David Mpanga nti abawawabirwa okuwozesebwa mu kooti y'abantu babulijjo n'ey'amagye kibateeka mu kabi era kuba kubatulugunya
Besigye’s lawyer had submitted that the rearrest created doubt whether the accused would ever get a fair trial since the state had treated them as if they were guilty even before the court judgement	Balooya ba Besigye baagamba nti eky'okuddamu okumukwata kireetawo okubuusabuusa obanga omuwawabirwa aliramurwa mu bwenkanya okuva bwe kyali nti eggwanga lyali libatwala nti baaliko omusango nga ne kooti tenagubasalira

The cost, in men, material, and money, of the Somalia war has become an issue since President Yoweri Museveni announced in September that he is ready to deploy another 12,000 and 20,000 UPDF troops to Somalia to bolster the 7000strong contingent already there	Pulezidenti Yoweeri Museveni yalangirira mu Sebutemba nti yali mwetegefu okuyungula abalala 12,000

Uganda’s representative at the UN in New York, veteran politician Dr Ruhakana Rugunda moved quickly to put Somalia on the UN agenda	Omukiise wa Uganda mu kibiina ky'Amawana Amagatte mu New York, eyawummula amagye Dr Ruhakana Rugunda yayanguwa mangu okuteeka Somalia mu lukalala lwa UN olw'ebirina okuteesebwako
When on Oct 3, Rugunda led a United Nations Security Council delegation to a meeting with Museveni at State House in Entebbe, two issues were top on the agenda; a pledge from the UN for support to Uganda’s mission in Somalia and increased scrutiny of the upcoming referendum in Southern Sudan	Nga Okitoba 3, Rugunda yatwala abakungu b'Olukiiko lw'Eby'Okwerinda olw'Ekibiina ky'Amawanga Amagatte okusisinka Museveni mu Maka g'Obwapulezidenti Entebe, ebintu bibiri ebyasooka ku lukalala lw'ebigenda okuteesebwako; sente okuva mu Kibiina ky'Amawanga Amagate okuwangira Uganda mu lutalo lw'e Somalia n'okwongera kwetegereza kalulu k'ekikungo mu Southern Sudan

In the same week, Museveni hosted 27 members of the European Union’s top military organ to rally efforts against the resurgent Al Shabaab	Mu wiiki y'emu, Museveni ya kyaza abakungu okuva mu kibiina kya European Union nga bano basirikale abo ku ntikko okubakubiriza okussa amanyi mu kulwanyisa Al Shabaab
Museveni, who has been in power for 24 years, needs to reinvent himself	Museveni abadde mu buyinza okumala emyaka 24, yeetaaga okwezza obugya
As a reaction, Museveni has muzzled free expression in the media and other public spaces and clawed back the little democratic space his government previously let citizens enjoy	Ng'ayanukula, Museveni ayogedde kaati mu mawulire n'empuliziganya eddala n'ayogera ku demokulase gavumenti ye gwe yaaleetera abantu
When he attended the UN General Assembly late last month in New York, Museveni met with US President Barack Obama on the sidelines of the summit to discuss the Somalia situation and the pending referendum in Sudan under the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement that ended Sudan’s 22year old rebellion	Bwe yagenda mu Lukungaana lw'Ekibiina ky'Amawanga Amagate, ku nkomerero y'omwezi oguwedde, Pulezidenti w'Amerika Barack Obama yasisinkanamu ne Museveni okwoogera ku mbeera eri mu Somalia n'okulonda okw'ekikungo mu Sudan wa nsi wa 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement okwakomya obwewagguzi obwali mu Sudan emyaka 22 egiyise
Museveni’s biggest impediment to increasing the number of troops in Somalia is the funding and other logistical support for the additional troops	Ekiruubirirwa kya Museveni mu kwongera magye e Somalia kwe kufuna obuwangizi obulala n'amagye amalala
We have the human beings, we have the experience, we have the training, but we cannot provide the money,” Museveni told the press recently	"Tulina abantu, obumanyirivu, okutendekebwa, naye tetulna sente,"" bw'atyo Museveni bwe yagamba bannamawulire gyebuvuddeko awo"
Museveni asked the Security Council delegation to commit more money for his increased deployment but they were noncommittal	Museveni yasaba abakungu okuva mu Olukiiko Olukuuma Ddembe okwongera okubawa sente olw'abantu bakozesa naye tebaayanukula
Museveni is known to take unilateral positions if consensus seeking fails him	Museveni akola nnyo ebintu ku lulwe yekka singa ebiteeso by'abalala tebimuyamba
Museveni would have been more credible if in explaining the electoral chaos, he had continued his ‘hunter’ and ‘carcass’ analogy and told Ugandans that beasts like hyenas will always follow vultures all the way to some other predator’s kill or carcasses	Museveni yandibadde yeesigika singa bwe yali annyonnyola akavuyo akaali mu kulonda yakozesa eky'okulabirako kye eky'omuyizzi n'ensolo ettiddwa n'agamba ba Uganda nti ebisolo gamba ng'empisi egoberera ensega esobole okugituus awali 'ensolo effude'
If anything, the NRM primaries brought into the open what critics and commentators have often spoken out about but in abstract terms: the collapse of institutional governance and processes, systemic corruption and a culture of political impunity	Akalulu ak'okusunsulamu ak'ekibiina kya NRM kaleeseewo okukolokota era aboogezi bakoogerako mu ngeri embi: obutabaawo obukulembeze n'enkola egobererwa mu bitongole, obulyi bw'enguzi n'obutavunaanwa

Although Lubega remains defiant that the court injunction is inconsequential, the legal advisor to the Democratic Party of the Norbert Mao leadership, Mukasa Mbidde, says it is enforceable	Wadde nga Lubega agaana nti ekiragiro kya kooti si kikulu, omuwi w'amagezi ew'Ekibiina ya Ddemokulase ekiri wansi w'obukulembeze bwa Norbert Mao, Mukasa Mbidde, yagamba nti kirina okugobererwa
Mbidde says the court order issued on October 8 will result in the arrest and prosecution of Lubega and his group if they continue “masquerading” as leaders of DP	" Mbidde agamba nti ekiragira kya kooti nga Okkutoba 8 kijja kuviirako okukwatibwa n'okugulwako omusango ku Lubega ne banne singa baneeyongera ""okwefuula nga"" abakulembeze b'Ekibiina kya Demokulase"
He says the ruling was delivered by judge Lawrence Giddudu the same person who presided over the petition the Lubega faction had taken to court challenging the legitimacy of the DP leadership under Mao	Yagamba nti omulamuzi Lawrence Giddudu ya yasala omusango nga ye muntu y'omu eyakola ku musango gwa Lubega gwe yatwala mu kooti ng'awakanya nti Ekibiina kya Demokulase tekiri mu mateeka
Giddudu dismissed the petition in May	Giddudu omusango yagugoba mu Maayi
Lubega had sought court to nullify the February party delegates conference in Mbale which elected Mao’s DP leadership	Lubega yasaba kooti okugyawo olukungaana olwaliwo mu Febwari mu Mbale olw'abakungu abaalonda Mao ng'omukulembeze w'Ekibiina kya Demokulase
Lubega had contended that the delegates conference had been held unconstitutionally and was therefore a nullity	Lubega yagamba nti olukungaana lw'abakkungu telwali mu mateeka era lwagaanibwa
But the judge dismissed the petition on a technical ground that in the petition, the Lubega group had presented themselves as DP leaders yet the national Electoral Commission only recognises the Mao DP leadership	Naye omulamuzi yagoba omusango, Lubega ne banne mwe baali beetwala okuba abakulembeze b'Ekibiina kya Demokulase
Mbidde told The Independent that he had forwarded the court order to the Electoral Commission and the police to arrest Lubega and his group if they continued to present themselves in public as DP leaders	Mbidde yagamba oyo eyesimbawo awatali kibiina nti ekiwandiiko kya kooti akitute eri Akakiiko k'Eby'Okulonda era nti poliisi ekwate Lubega ne banne singa beeyongera okwelaga mu lujjudde bakulembeze b'ekibiina kya DP
Lubega denied knowledge of the court order and said his lawyer had not received it either	Lubega yagamba nti talabangako kiwandiiko kuva mu kooti era nti ne balooyabe tebakifunangako
He speculated that Mbidde was lying	Yagamba nti Mbidde yali alimba
He argued that Mbidde could not have gotten the court order on the basis of a ruling that had been appealed	Yagamba nti Mbidde yali teyeerabidde kiragiro kya kooti ekigamba nti yali ajjulira
Lubega said he had, on October 7,  appealed against the dismissal of his petition and the case was still pending hearing	Lubega yagamba nti nga Okutoba 7, yajulira eky'okugoba omusango gwe era nti omusango gwali gulinda kuwulirwa
He claimed even when the court dismissed his petition, it did not pronounce itself on whether Mao’s leadership was the legitimate representatives of DP	Yabyogera wadde nga kooti yali egobye omusango gwe, teyalangirira obanga obukulembeze bwa Mao mu Kibiina kya Demokulase bwali bukkirizibwa mu mateeka
Mbidde said they did not secure the injunction on the basis of Lubega’s appeal	Mbidde yagamba nti tebaafuna kiragiro kya kooti kyonna ekikwata ku kujulira kwa Lubega
He said the injunction was based on its own merits and the Lubega’s appeal would have no bearing on it	Yagamba nti okusalawo okwo kwaganyula bo era okujulira kwa Lubega kwalina akakwate nakwo
“The appeal will probably be heard two years from now,” Mbidde said	"Mbidde yagamba nti ""okujulira kujja kuwulirwa emyaka ebiri okuva kati"""
However, while Mbidde says he forwarded the court  injunction to the police and the Electoral Commission, the police spokesperson for Kampala Metropolitan Idi Senkumba said he had not heard of it	Kyokka Mbidde agamba nti ekiragiro kya kooti yakitwala ku poliisi n'eri Kakiiko k'Eby'Okulonda, naye omwogezi wa poliisi mu Bendobendo lya Kampala Idi Senkumba yagamba nti yali takirabangako
The head of the Political Parties Desk at the Electoral Commission Patrick Byakagaba also denied knowledge about the injunction, saying he had not seen it or heard of it by October 7 when he left office	Akulira Ebibiina by'Obufuzi ku Kakiiko k'Eby'Okulonda Patrick Byakagaba era yagaana nti tafunangako kiragiro, yagamba nti takirabangako oba okukiwulirako okuva Okutobba 7 lwe yava mu yafeesi
The Electoral Commission recognises the Mao leaders as the official DP establishment and this has sucked the national electoral body into the fray	Akakiiko k'Eby'Okulonda katwala abakulembeze ba Mao ng'abakungu b'ekibiina kya DP era kino kireetedde abalonzesa okusatulukuka
The court appeal by the Lubega faction shows that the Electoral Commission has been sued together with the Mao leadership, former DP president Ssebaana Kizito and Mathias Nsubuga who acted as the party Secretary General during the delegates conference in Mbale	Okujulira kwa Lubega mu kooti kulaga nti Akakiiko k'Eby'Okulonda kali bumu ne n'obukulembeze bwa Mao, eyaliko omukulembeze w'Ekibiina kya Demokulase Ssebaana Kizito ne Mathias Nsubuga eyakolanga Omuwandiisi mu lukungaana lwa bakungu e Mbale
Lubega accuses the Electoral Commission of legitimising Mao’s leadership by recognising them as the rightful leaders of DP when the process through which they were elected is still in dispute in court	Lubega avunaana Akakiiko k'Eby'Okulonda okukkiriza Mao ng'omukulembeza w'Ekibiina kya Demokulase omutuufu, ate ng'enkola eyayitibwamu okumukonda ekyawakanyizibwa mu kooti
Dismissing the Lubega petition, court held that it’s Mao leadership which was recognised by the Electoral Commission	Ng'egoba omusango gwa kooti, kooti yagamba nti obukulembeze bwa Mao bukkirizibwa Akakiiko k'Eby'Okulanda

He dismisses the claim that Kabanyoro having been out of active politics for while is a big undoing on her political clout in the area	Awakanya ekigambiwa nti ekyokuba nti Kabanyoro tabadde mu byabufuzi okumala ekiseera kinafuyiza obuyinza bw'alina mu by'obufuzi mu kitundu

But Mbaju’s chances of winning maybe affected by Constantine Siwako who has indicated he will stand as an independent after his candidature in FDC primaries for  the same seat was cancelled on academic grounds	Naye omukisa gwa Mbaju okuwangula guyinza okulemesebwa Constantine Siwako alaze nti ajja kwesimbawo ku bwa nnamunigina oluvanyuma lw'okwesimbawo kwe mu kalaulu k'okusunsulamu mu FDC mu kifo kye kimu okusazibwamu olw'ensonga z'obuyigirize bwe
In Busingora North FDC has fronted William Nzoghu, who has worked with a number of NGOs in the region, to contest against incumbent NRM legislator Elijah Kyetunda	Mu bukiikakono wa Busingora FDC etaddewo Williama Nzoghu, abadde akakola mu bitongole eby'enjawulo ebitali bya gavumenti okuvuganya n'omukungu okuva mu NRM Elijah Kyetunda
He lost to Kyetunda in 2006 by a margin of 751 votes	Kyetunda yamusinga obululu 751 mu 2006
In the newly created Kasese Municipality constituency FDC has deployed Musa Bwambale, a son to former Kasese District Woman MP Loyce Biira Bwambale	Mu Munisupaali empya mu konsituwense ya Kasese, FDC etaddewo Musa Bwambale mutabani wa Loyce Biira Bwambale eyali Omubaka w'Abakyala mu Palimenti owa Disitulikitu ya Kasese
He will compete for the seat with NRM’s James Mbahimba	Ajja kuvuganya ku kifo ekyo ne James Mbahimba owa NRM
This was even in defiance of the advice by then de facto cultural leader of the people of Rwenzururu, Charles Wesley Iremangoma, to his subjects to vote UPC	Kino kyali okunyoma amagezi g'omukulembeze w'ebyobuwangwa owa Rwenzururu, Charles Wesley Iremangoma, eri abawagizibe okulonda ekibiina kya UPC
In the 2006 multiparty elections, Kasese again showed their stubbornness by voting the FDC’s Besigye to defeat President Museveni	Mu kulonda kw'ebibiina mu 2006, era Kasese yalaga nti eronda Besigye owa FDC awangule Pulezidenti Museveni
It was widely interpreted that Kasese had voted the opposition as a protest vote because President Museveni had refused or failed to recognise their kingdom, Obusinga bwa Rwenzururu	Kigambibwa nti Kasese yalonda oludda oluvuganya kubanga Pulezidenti Museveni yagaana oba yalemererwa okukkiriza obwakabaka bwa Rwenzururu
There is a general feeling among the populace that the recognition of the kingdom came too late and was because of their pressure rather than the NRM and Museveni’s magnanimity	Kigambibwa nti okukkiririza obwa Kabaka kyajja kikeerezi era kyava ku kupikirizibwa so si kusiima kwa NRM ne Museveni
According to Dr Aaron Mukwaya of Makerere University’s Department of Political Science, the index, “fails to analyse the underlying factors and forces involved in Africa’s struggling political and economic spheres	Okusinziira ku Dr. Aaron Mukwaya ow'ekitongole ky'eby'o bufuzi ekya Yunivasite y'e Makerere, ebiwandiiko biremererwa okulaga ensonga n'amaanyi ebiteekebwa mu by'obufuzi n'ebyenfuna bya Afirika.
” Dr Mukwaya says the index is based on a consultant’s model and an “outside outlook”	"Dr.Mukwaya agamba nti ebiwandiiko byesigamye kunkola y'abakugu n'abantu ab'ebweru"""
Fredrick Golooba Mutebi of Makerere University’s Institute for Social Research agrees with this sentiment	Fredrick Golooba Mutebi ow'ekitongole kya Social Research e Makarere Yunivasite akkiriziganya n'endowooza eyo
According to Golooba Mutebi the danger with such indexes is how they create perceptions about Africa which are not necessarily accurate, even if they do give a broad picture of what people already know	Okusiinziira ku Golooba Mutebi, akabi akali mu biwandiiko ngebyo y'engeri gye bireetawo endowooza ku Afirika etali ntuufu wadde nga biwa ekifaananyi kinene ku ekyo abantu kye bamanyi
“There is a tendency to see African countries as static and these indexes recycle this picture,” Golooba Mutebi says	Golooba Mutebi agamba nti, batera okukitwala nti ensi z'Afirika tezikulaakulana era endowooza ezo zikomyawo ekifaananyi ekyo
Mutebi notes that drawing conclusions from data which does not represent current underpinnings of African country performance, as it is seen on the ground, stands to discredit the index	Mutebi agamba nti,okukkiriza ebintu ebitawa kifaananyi kituufu ku ngeri ensi z'Afirika gye zikolamu, kyeyoleka kaati, era kikontana n'endowooza ezo
Mutebi sees utility for the prize committee to refuse giving out the award until its criteria are met as to not reduce the award to a mere “ritual”	Mutebi akiraba nti akakiiko okugaana okugaba ekirabo okutuusa ng'emitendera gigobereddwa, kiyamba okukendeeza ku kufuula ekirabo obutaba ky'amakulu.
Mutebi notes that “Presidents are not driven by their desire for recognition rather than for their narrow interests	Mutebi agamba nti abakulembeze b'amawanga tebatwalirizibwa kwegomba kwabwe okw'okumanyika wabua ebyo bye baagala
Margaret Asiimwe, 14, a Primary Six pupil of Kivumbi Primary School in Kampala cannot read or answer questions in English	ddamu ebibuuzo mu Lungereza
However, her teacher, Arthur Bwiire, says Asiimwe is one of the brightest pupils at the school	Kyokka omusomesa we Arthur Bwiire agamba nti Asiimwe y'omu ku baana abasinga obugezi mu ssomero
Despite being the health prefect for her school, Asiimwe is incapable of addressing her fellow pupils in English	Wadde nga ye muyizi akulira eby'obulamu ku ssomero, Asiimwe tasobola kwogera eri bayizi banne mu Lungereza
Bwiire, who is not well conversant in English himself, blames a lack of textbooks and opportunities to practise on the pupils’ failure to speak English	Bwiire ateekakasa Lungereza, yeekwasa eky'obutaba na bitabo n'eky'baana obuteemanyiiza kwogera Lungereza
As a result of increased enrollment, says Fortunate Ahimbisibwe of the Ministry of Education, there is now a critical shortage Uganda amongst worst places to be in school Pupils and teachers can’t speak English Pupils at a primary school Rwemiyaga, Sembabule district study under a tree	Olw'omuwendo gw'abaana ogeyongedde, Fortunate Ahimbisibwe ow'ekitongole ky'ebyenjigiriza agamba nti waliwo ebbula ly'ebifo mu masomero; abaana n'abasomesa tebasobola kwogera Lungereza ate era abaana b'essomero e Remiyaga Ssembabule basomera wansi wa muti

President Museveni has often argued that it is the parents’ responsibility, not the government’s, to provide lunch for their children	Emirundi mingi Pulezidenti Museveni agamba nti buvunaanyizibwa bw'abazadde okuwa abaana babwe eky'emisana so si gavumenti
Wafula Oguttu, the spokesperson for Forum for Democratic Change, says that the report’s findings are important	Wafula Oguttu omwogezi w'ekibiina kya FDC agamba nti abizuuliddwa mu alipoota bikulu nnyo
Wafula says that the majority of government schools lack teaching facilities and teachers, yet the government does not want to recruit more teaching staff	Wafula agamba nti amasomero ga gavumenti agasinga teggalina bikozesebwa era tegalina basomesa atenga gavumenti teyagala  kwongera ku muwendo gw'abasomesa
Those who are there are paid poorly and as a result end up dodging classes,” Wafula says	"Wafula agamba nti, ""abo abaliyo basasulwa obusente butono n'ekivaamu tebasomesa"
For example in the districts of Butaleja, Mbale, Arua, Maracha, Oyam, Pader and Abim, the ratio is 1:120, alarmingly higher than the recommended 1:50	Ng'ekyokulabirako, disitulikiti za Butaleja, Mbale, Arua, Maracha, Oyam, Pader ne Abim, omuwendo guli 1:120 nga guno munene nnyo okusinga 1:50 ogusuubirwa
Wafula adds that for as long as enrolment keeps rising with fixed school facilities, education standards in Uganda will keep deteriorating	Wafula agamba nti singa okuwandiisa abaana mu masomero kweyongera nga tewali bikosesebwa mutindo gw'ebyenjigiriza mu Uganda gujja kweyongera okuddirira
The only exception has been MTN which continues to charge Shs 6 per second	MTN yokka ye kyasasuza Sillingi 6 buli katikitiki
“There are no plans for tariff changes in the pipeline at the moment,” says MTN Chief Marketing Officer Isaac Nsereko, “Our customers get value for money since most of the subscribers are on MTN	"Tewaliwo ntegeka mukiseera kino bwatyo omukungu Isaac Nsereko akolanga Marketing Officer mu MTN bwa gamba, ""Bakasitoma baffe baganyulwa mu sente okuva bwe kiri nti abeewandiisa bangi bali ku MTN"
”MTN’s reaction is unusual for a market leader	MTN byekola tebisuubirwa mu oyo akulira akatale
This is the second time a Warid tariff cut is shaking up the market	Guno gwe mulunndi ogw'okubiri ng'okusalibwa kw'emiwendo gya Warid kugataanya emiwendo
When Warid Telecom cut its call tariff to other networks to Shs 299 or Shs 5 per second (Peak) and Shs 249 (off Peak) in February 2008, it sparked off a similar price war as the competition scrambled to match its offer	Warid Telecom bwe yasala ku miwendo egy'okukuba ku mikutu emirala ne giba  Siringi 299 oba Siringi 5 ku bulii katikitki (ng'abakuba amasimu bangi) nesiringi 249 (ng'abakuba amasimu bakendedde) mu Febwali wa 2008, kyaleetawo okuvuganya n'akakyankalano mu miwendo
Back then market leaders, MTN, launched its MTN Zone which offered up to 99 percent discounts to customers depending on availability of capacity and Zain introduced its 12hour free innetwork calling	Mu kiseera ekyo abaali bakulembera mu katale k'amasimu aba MTN bateekawo enkola ya MTN zone eyasalako emiwendo okutuuka ku bitundu 99 ku 100 okusinziira ku busobozi ne kampuni ya Zain yateekawo essaawa 12 ez'okukubira ku bwereere
MTN could also be counting on ‘customer confusion’ which renders customers unable to switch to the competition, according to Charles Omagor, a marketing expert who is also the dean of the Faculty of Commerce at Makerere University Business School	Okusinziira ku Charles Omagor omukugu mu bwa kitunzi era nga y'akulira amasomo g'e by'obusuubuzi ku ttendekero ly'eby'obusuubuzi e Nakawa, MTN nayo yandibadde erowooza ku kutabulatabula ba kasitoma ekiviirako ba kasitoma okulemererwa okwetaba mu kuvuganya
He says MTN offers packages like yellowmax, paygo standard, MTN zone and per second and a subscriber who is already confused on which package on the MTN network to choose is likely to get even more confused if tempted to switch to another network, where there are also several packages to select from	Agamba nti MTN etaddewo enkola za kitunzi gamba nga; yellowmax, paygo standard, MTN zone, ne per second era kasitoma yenna asobeddwa okulondako enkola ku mpuliziganya ya MTN ajja kweyongera okusoberwa singa agenda ku mpuliziganya endala nazo ezirina enkola zaazo ez'enjawulo
“Fearing that there could be even worse confusion elsewhere, the subscriber will most likely choose to stay where he is,” argues Omagor	"""Olw'okutya nti ajja kweyongera okusoberwa, kirabika nti omuntu ajja kusalawo okusigala ku mukutu kwali,"" bw'atyo Omagor bwagamba"
But Omagor says the natural reaction from a marketer’s perspective is to pause and watch the competitors	Naye Omagor agamba nti ba kitunzi batera okuyimirizaamu ne batunuuliraa abavuganya
Commenting on its reaction, MTN’s Nsereko told The Independent: “We are studying the situation and we can only respond when we think it is necessary	Ng'ayogera ku ekyo kye kyakola, Nsereko owa yagamba olupapula lw'amawulire olwa The Independent nti 'Tukyetegeza embeera era tujja kubaako kye tukola bwe kiba kyetaagisa'

Bank of Baroda Uganda started in 1953 as a subsidiary of Baroda but was incorporated as a separate entity in 1969	Banka of Baroda Uganda yatandikibwawo mu 1953 ng'etabi lya Baroda naye yetongola mu 1969
Like so many overly ambitious and simplistic Africans, Isabirye, the play’s central character goes to great length to “buy” a visa to fly abroad for greener pastures	"Okufaananako Abafirika bangi abaagala okugaggawala n'okuba mu bulamu obweyagaza, Isabirye akola kyonna ky'asobola ""okugula"" viza agende ebweru awali obulamu obulungi"

The background from which 23year old Moses Kipsiro, the 2007 5,000 meter bronze medallist as well as 2008 world cross country runnerup, came to prominence is both disjointed and bewildering, but strikingly similar to AkiiBua’s	Ebikwata ku Moses Kipsiro ow'emyaka 23, eyadduka n'awangula omudaali gw'ekikomo mu 2007, mu misinde egya mita 5,000 era omuddusi eyakwata ekifo eky'okubiri mu misinde mubuna byalo mu 2008, afaananako Akiibua

The Kipsiros have grown up amongst this lot	Kipsiros akulaakulanye mu bino
”The country’s few successful athletes in recent times like Kipsiro himself, Boniface Kiprop (former world junior 10k record holder) and Dorcus Inzikuru (2005 steeple world champ) are all school drop outs who sought the track as a shortcut to earning a living	Bannansi abatono abatuuse ku buwanguzi mu kudduka gyebuvuddeko awo ngamba nga Kipsiro, Boniface, Kiprop  (eyaliko omwana w'ensi yonna eyawangula omutwalo) ne Dorcus Inzikuru (owo ku ntiko mu nsi yonna mu 2005) bonna baava mu masomero ne banoonya engeri y'okweyimirizaawo
Moses is highly regarded	Moses afiibwako nnyo
The country had hinged all its hope on (Boniface) Kiprop but his failed promise put added pressure on Kipsiro	Ensi yali etadde obwesige mu (Boniface ) Kiprop naye bw'atawangula kya teeka Kipsiros ku bunkenke
Kiprop had not done too badly but he remains in the shadow of the Ethiopians and Kenyans	Kiprop yali takoze bubi naye yasigala wansi wa Ab'Esiyopiya ne Bannakenya
“I always wanted to be an athlete,” Moses Kipsiro says quietly	"""Nalinga njagala kubeera muddusi,"" bw'atyo Moses Kipsiro bwe yagamba"
”Kipsiro showed some early promise but nothing striking	"""Kipsiro yalagirawo essuubi naye tewali kyavaamu"
Kipsiro at HomeKipsiro is mentally resilient, and pragmatic as is evident from a recent journey from Limerick, Ireland back home to Uganda	Kipsiro yasiriikirira ng'ali waka, era okuba nti yagoonjola ekizibu kyalabikira mu kukomawo okuva mu Limerick, Ireland okudda mu Uganda
Moses Kipsiro of Uganda is the favourite	Moses Kipsiro  muganzi nnyo

Kipsiro is a quiet unassuming man and an intensely religious man	Kipsiro teyeewaana era munaddiini nnyo
Kipsiro’s trainingHis training in Uganda is determined necessarily by the terrain, the environment and the time of year	Okutendekebwa kwa Kipsiro mu Uganda kwesigama ku nkula y'ekitundu, embeera ekiseera ky'omwaka
In keeping with the African approach, Kipsiro doesn’t count mileage	Ng'agoberera enkola y'Ababafirika, Kipsiro tatunuulira bbuzibu obunaabaawo
Kipsiro will run for an hour or ninety minutes each day	Kipsiro yaddukanga essaawo emu oba eddakiika kyenda buli lunaku
Kipsiro trains alone, at altitude, without the presence of his coach and agent Ricky Simms, who is better known for being Usain Bolt’s agent as well	Kipsiro yetendeka yekka, ku kasozi, ng'omutendesi we taliiwo era n'omuwambi we Ricky Simms, amanyidda ng'omukozi wa Usain Bolt
But the coach is keenly aware of what Kipsiro is doing each day and is satisfied that he will not over train	Naye omutendesi we amanyi Kipsiro ky'akola buli lunaku era akimanyi nti teyeetendeka kisukkiridde
When it’s compatible with his own training, Kipsiro trains with the elite staple of Kenyans under Simm’s tutelage	Bwe kiba nga kikwatagana n'okwetendeka kwe, Kipsiro yetendeka ne Bannakenya abagagga n'omusomesa wa Simm
These sessions allowed Kipsiro to mingle with the Kenyan athletes whom he admired, namely Daniel Komen and the great Moses Kiptanui	Kino kisobozesa Kipsiro okwegatta Bannakenya abaddusi be yeegomba nga ye Daniel Komen ne Moses Kiptanui nantameggwa
”Simms’s task is to fine tune and maximise Kipsiro’s exciting potential	Omulimu gwa Simm kwe kugyayo obusobozi bwa Kipsiro

Kipsiro is the first runner after 70 years to win a double	Kipsiro ye muddusi eyasooka okuwangula emirundi ebiri oluvannyuma lw'emyaka 70
“My favourite distance is the 5000m and I hope to get my time down to 12:45,” says Kipsiro who in addition to his bronze in 2007 was 4th at the 2008 Games and 2009 world champs in the 5k	"""Njagala nnyo okudduka embiro za mita 5000 era nsuubira okukendeeza ku saawa zenziddukira zituuke ku 12:45 bw'atyo Kipsiro bw'agamba era yangula omuddaali gw'ekikomo mu 2007 era yali wakuna mu mizannyo egyaliwo mu 2008 ne bannantemegwa b'ensi mu 2009 mu nkumi etaano"

The new law which seems designed to catch Kabaka Mutebi who through former Buganda Premier, Mulwanyamuli Semwogerere, and the likes of former Mengo Minister Medadi Sseggona, is associated with the pressure group Suubi 2011, bars cultural leaders from engaging in partisan politics or joining any political party	Etteeka epya kirabika lyateekebwawo okukwasa Kabaka Mutebi eyayitira mu eyali Katikkiro wa Buganda Mulwanyamuli Semwogerere n'eyali minisita w'e Mengo Medadi Sseggona, yapikirizibwa akabinja akayitibwa Ssuubi 2011 akagaana omukulu w'ebyo buwangwa yenna okwetaba mu by'obufuzi oba okuyingira ekibiina kye by'obufuzi kyonna
Mutebi does not get the Shs5 million monthly token from the government and does not have a government house or car	Mutebi tafuna bukadde 5 obwa buli mwezi okuva mu govumenti era talina nnyumba ya gavumenti oba emmotoka

You might have been wondering how much each of Moses Kipsiro’s gold medals from the just concluded Commonwealth Games in New Delhi is worth	Oyinza okuba nga weebuuza nti buli gumu ku midaali gya zaabu egya Moses Kipsiro gye yawangula mu mizannyo gya Common Wealth mu New Delhi gibalirilwamu ssente mmeka
Well, President Yoweri Museveni has eventually given you a clue	Pulezidenti Yoweri Museveni abawadde oluwenda
On top of the cash, Museveni promised to construct a residential house for the marathoner who raced himself into Uganda’s and the Commonwealth Games’ record books with the country’s first double gold at a major international event	Okugatta ku ssente enkalu, Museveni yasuubiza okuzimbira omuddusi ennyumba eyawangulira Uganda emiddaali ebiri era eyawandiikibwa mu byafaayo by'emizanyo gya CommonWealth egy'ensi yonna
Museveni also promised to upgrade a training field in Kipsiro’s home district of Bukwo into a fourlane training field to provide athletes there with high altitude training facilities	Era Museveni yasuubiza okuzibwa ekisaawe ekitekerwamu abaddusi mu disitulikiti ya Kipsiro ey'e Bukwo nga kyakubeera n'enkuubo nnya eziddukirwamu kisobozese abaddusi okutendekebwa obulungi
I like President Museveni’s style	Njagala enkola ya Pulezidenti Museveni
Voter register not readyThe Electoral Commission once again has the opposition really worried	Enkalala z'Abalonzi bwe zitaba ntegeke Akakiiko k'Eby'Okulonda kaba keraliikiriza ab'oludda oluvugannya
The EC displayed the national voters register between August 11 and September 13 to allow village tribunals to clear it of dead, underage or other ineligible voters	Akakiiko k'eby'okulonda kaalaga enkalala z'abalonzi wakati wa Agusito 11 ne sebutemba 13 kisobozese obukiiko bw'ebyalo okunsunsulamu abaafa, abataweza myaka n'abo abalala abatakkirizibwa kulonda
In early August the EC kicked off a storm when it announced that it had registered 15,002,720 voters, a figure that the opposition challenges on grounds that it is practically impossible for half of the country’s population to be eligible voters	Ku ntandikwa ya Agusito, akakiiko k'eby'okulonda kaaleetawo akakyankalano bwe kalangira nti kawandiisizza abalonzi obukadde 15,002,720, abo bali ku ludda oluvvuganya kye bawakanya nti tekisoboka abalonzi okuba ekitundu kimu kya kubiri  ekya bantu bonna abali mu Uganda
Now with EC Boss Kiggundu saying that the final number of voters is yet to be tallied and the final register yet to be finalised, the question of how many people qualify to vote remains a major contention, at least the coming weeks Minister of Works and Transport John Nasasira (R) talks to the the African Union official Paulus Geraedts at the opening of the SubSaharan African Transport Policy meeting at Speke Resort Munyonyo on October 18	Omukulu w'akakiiko k'eby'okulonda Kiggundu agamba nti omuwendo gw'abalonzi gukyaina okukakasibwa era n'okumaliriza enkalala z'abalonzi. Akatuubagiro kakyali ku bantu bameka abagwanidde okulonda. Naye mu wiiki ezijja Minisita webyentambula John Nasasira ajja kwogera n'omukungu wa African Union Paulus Geraedts ku lukungana lw'amawanga aga SubSaharan African Transport Policy ku Speke Resort Munyonyo nga Okitoba 18

But look: The second most influential man in Uganda after President Yoweri Museveni is Amama Mbabazi from Kanungu district	Omuntu omututumufu mu Uganda addirira Puleezidenti Yoweri Museveni ye Amama Mbabazi okuva mu Disitulikiti ya Kanungu
Mbabazi and a few elites are not “the people of Kanungu	"Mbabazi n'abagagga abawerako si ""bantu be Kanungu"
” Yet Mbabazi is not an oddity; his is the story of Africa’s democratic experiment	Mbambazi si muntu wa njawulo; muwagizi wa demokulase w'Afirika
If Museveni wants to win the Bairu vote in Ankole, he does little to address their concerns over healthcare, education and transportation	Museveni bwaba ng'ayagala okufuna obuwagizi bwa Abairu mu Ankole, aba alina okukola ku nsonga zaabwe ezikwata ku by'obulamu, eby'enjigiriza n'eby'entambula
He appoints Amanya Mushega, Kahinda Otafiire and Ephraim Kamuntu into his cabinet	Alonda Amanya Mushega, Kahinda Otafiire and Ephraim Kamuntu mu kakiiko ke aka ba minisita
His opponent, Kizza Besigye, in trying to win over the Baganda does not address their concerns over land and agricultural policy	Oyo amuvuganya Kiiza Besigye mu kugezaako okufuna obuwagizi mu Baganda tagezaako kuyingirira bya ttaka na byabulimi
He strikes a deal with two former Katikkiros – Ssemwogerere Mulwanyamuli and Daniel Muliika	Ateeseganya n'abaaliko bakattikiro babiri - Ssemwogerere Mulwanyamuli ne Daniel Muliika
When Museveni openly gives envelops stuffed with cash to ordinary people, as has become his norm these days, he is addressing a vital existential need to gain political advantage	Museveni bw'awa abantu babulijjo ebbaasa ezijjudde sente nga bw'akola ebiseera bino, aba akola ku kyetaago ekikuku asobole okufuna obuwagizi mu by'oufuzi
While appearing before parliament on October 13, the Minister of Internal Affairs, Kirunda Kivejinja, claimed the book is a national security threat	Bwe yali mu Palamenti nga Okitoba 13, Minisita w'Ensonga ez'omunda Kirunda Kivejinja, yagamba nti ekitabo kyabulabe eri eby'okwerinda kw'egwanga
Dr Kobusingye, the author, is a sister of the leader of the opposition Forum for Democratic (FDC) party, retired Col. Dr. Kizza Besigye	Dr. Kobusingye omuwandiisi w'ekitabo ekyo mwannyina wa  Col. Dr. Kizza Besigye eyawummula, omukulu w'ekibiina kya FDC
It’s a chronology and examination of how Museveni has made 360degree turn from his passionate promises and ideals of 1986 to the political evils of the past regimes he had contemptuously condemned	Kyewuunyisa engeri Museveni gyakubye enkyukira okuva ku bisuubizo ebisikiriza era ebirungi ebyomu 1986 okudda mu muvuyo gw'ebyobufuzi ogw'emabega gwe yali avumirira
It chronicles the early signs in the 1990s of what the author calls Museveni’s derailment from the Movement’s original ideals, the failed internal struggles to reform the Movement and the emergency of Besigye on the political arena	Kiraga obubonero obusooka mu 1990 omuwandiisi ky'ayita okuva kwa Museveni ku biruubirirwa by'ekibiina kya Muvumenti, olutalo olwomunda olwalemwa okuzaawo ekibiina kya Muvumenti n''okugya kwa Besigye mu nsiike ye by'obufuzi
It shows how, prior to announcing his candidature, Besigye warned his family of the dangers his action would expose them to during his pursuit of democratic change in Uganda	Kiraga ebyayogerwa nga tanneesimbawo, Besigya yalabula ab'omu maka ge ku kabi akandivuddemu bwe yandiruubiridde okukola enkyukakyuka ez'okuzzaawo demokulase mu Uganda
“Besigye repeated his warning that we might be targeted for harassment, and I recall Margaret [Besigye’s sister now in exile] saying she was not going into the second exile,” the author writes	"Omuwandiisi agamba nti "" Besigye yaddamu okulabula ng'agamba nti bayinza okutulugunyizibwa era ajjukira Margaret [Mwanyina wa Byesigye kati ali mu buwanganguse] agamba nti tagenda kudda mu buwanguse"
Margaret Kifefe was first forced into exile by Amin’s military regime	Margaret Kifefe ye yasooka okuwangangusibwa mu biseera bya Amin eby'ekinamagye
The author catalogues the extrajudicial killings especially of political opponents under Museveni’s regime, the collapse of the rule of law and the role of the state in the death of Besigye’s brother Joseph Musasizi Kifefe to whom the book is dedicated	Omuwandiisi yateekamu okutta okutalkkirizibwa mu mateeka naddala okw'abo abali ku ludda oluvuganya okuli mu bufuzi bwa Museveni, obutagoberera mateeka n'egwanga kye lyakola mu kufa kwa muganda wa Byesigye Joseph Musasizi Kifefe
In fact in its preface, the book begins with a reminiscence of the state kidnappings and killings during Obote’s regime before it quickly brings you back to a similar state of affairs under Museveni today	Mu ntandikwa yakyo, ekitabo kyogera ku kuwata abakazi n'okutta okwaliwo mu mulembe gwa Obote amangu ddala nga tekinakuzaayo mu mbeera y'emu eriwo kati mu bufuzi bwa Museveni
“One afternoon in 1981 when I had been at Makerere University for only a couple of weeks, my niece Annette burst into my room at Africa Hall wailing	Olweggulo olumu mu 1981, muwala wange Annette yayingira mu kisenge kyange mu Africa Hall ng'atema emiranga
Her mother Beatrice Kemigisha had been taken away by Obote’s security operatives	Maamawe Beatrice Kemigisha yali atwaliddwa abasirkale ba Obote
This reminiscence brings an instant juxtaposition of the character of Museveni’s regime and the regimes he overthrew, which shows that they are not much different today	Ekitabo kino kigata wamu enkola y'omulembe gwa Museveni n'emirembe emirala ggye yaggyawo, ekiraga nti si bya njawulo leero
She uses Museveni’s own book and other writings on the political evils like state inspired violence, political persecution of opponents and arbitrary arrests he contemptuously condemned in the past	Akozesa ekitabo kya Museveni n'ebiwandiiko ebiralala eby'ogerwa ku bikolobero by'obufuzi nga ebikolwa eby'ettemu, bannabyafubuzi okutulugunya ababavuganya n'okusiba abantu awatali musango ekintu kye yavumirira emabega
The author brings out how Museveni has since become a vicious perpetrator of the same evils	Omuwandiisi alaga engeri Museveni gy'akoze ebikolebero bye bimu
For example in The Price of Bad Leadership; What is Africa’s Problem? Museveni condemned Milton Obote’s government for attacking the Kabaka’s palace in 1966	Ng'ekyokulabirako, ebikwata ku ffuga bbi; ekizibu kya Afrika kye kiriwa? Museveni yavumirira gavumenti ya Milton Obote olw'okulumba olubiri lwa Kabaka mu 1966
He stated: “During the 1966 when Obote was quarrelling with Mutesa, Obote’s army massacred many people	"Yagamba nti, "" Mu mwaka gwa 1966 Obote bwe yali ayomba ne Mutesa, amagye gatirimbula abantu bangi"""
If Mutesa is having a political quarrel with Obote, what does the population have to do with it and why kill them? I do not agree with the proverb that when two elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers	Bwe kiba nga Mutesa alina enkaayana z'ebyobufuzi ne Obote, abantu ba bulijjo kibakwatirako wa era lwaki battibwa? sik mu lwaki obatta? Sikkiriziganya n'enjogera egamba nti enjovu we zirwanira, omuddogwe guboonaabona
The incidents were a test on Museveni’s sincerity	Ebyaliwo byagezesa obwesimbu bwa Museveni
Museveni disagreed with Kabaka Muwenda Mutebi (Buganda’s king) who wanted to visit Kayunga, a part of his kingdom	Museveni teyakkiriziganya na Kabaka Muwenda Mutebi (Kabaka wa Buganda) eyali ayagala okukyala e Kayunga, ekitundu ky'obwakabaka bwe
The disagreement was sparked by a much smaller issue than the one between Obote and Mutesa in 1966	Obutakkaanya bwava ku kantu akatono ennyo akatenkana n'obwo obwaliwo wakati wa Obote ne Muteesa mu 1966
Museveni stopped the Kabaka on account that a local community in Kayunga was opposed to the king’s visit	Museveni yamiriza okukyala kwa kabaka olwokuba banna Kayunga baawakanya okukyala kwa kabaka
So what had happened to the government’s capacity to arrest rioters without killing them? Had Museveni lied in his book? Dr Kobusingye’s book shows that Museveni has so changed that he is no longer his former self	Kati kiki ekyatuuka ku busobozi bwa gavumenti okukwata abeekalakaasi nga tebabase? Museveni yalimba mu kitabo kye? Ekitabo kya dokita Kobusingye kiraga nti Museveni akyuse
Museveni had said nominations for all political posts would be done on individual merit under the Movement	Museveni yali agambye nti okusemba abantu ku bifo by'obufuzi kyandibadde kisinzira ku busobola bwa buli muntu wansi w'ekibiina  kya Muvumenti
But when Dr Besigye announced his candidature, Museveni declared him a deserter from the Movement	Naye Besigye bwe yalangirira eky'okwesimbawo kwe, Museveni yagamba nti yali yadduka mu kibiina kya Muvumenti
Museveni rallied the cabinet and the Caucus to announce him as the Movement’s preferred candidate for the 2001 elections	Museveni yakunga ba minisita be n'akabinja k'ekibiina okumulangirira ng'ekibiina kya Muvumenti gwe kisembye okwesimbawo mu kulonda kwa 2001
” The resolution was formally signed by Movement Caucus chairman Prof. Gilbert Bukenya on December 9, 2000	Ekyasalibwawo kyatekebwako omukono eyali Ssentabbe w'ekibiina kya Muvumenti Prof. Gilbert Bukenya nga Ddesemba 9,2000
By this, the author says, no other candidate was eligible to stand on the Movement ticket except Museveni yet the election was supposed to be on “individualmerit” basis	Mu kukola bwatyo, omuwandiisi agamba nti tewali eyesimbawo yenna eyali agwanira okutwala tiketi y'ekibiina kya muvumenti okugyako Museveni ng'ate okulonda kwali kwesigama ku busobozi bwa buli muntu sekinoomu
This amounts to blatant manipulation of the political system which Museveni had castigated shortly after capturing power	Kino kiringa okukyusakyusa enkola y'eby'obufuzi Museveni kya yali agyewo amangu ddala nga yakatwala obuyinza
So when Museveni was seeking to be endorsed as the only candidate for the Movement, wasn’t he in essence manipulating the political system against public interest? 	Museveni bwabanga ye yekka ye yali ayagala okwesimbawo okuva mu kibiina kya Muvumenti, yali tatyobodde nkola ya bya bufuzi abantu kye batayagala?
According to Museveni’s earlier writing, such cannot be called freedom	Okusinziira ku Museveni bye yasooka okuwandiika, ekyo tekiyitibwa ddembe
Kobusingye doubts Museveni’s sincerity in his earlier writings and suggests he was just covering up his political dishonesty	Kobusingye abusabuusa obwesimbu bwa Museveni mu ebyo bye yasooka okuwandiika, era agamba nti yali abikkiriria ku bulyake bwe mu by'obufuzi
“Since the NRM is not officially a political party despite having the characteristics of a ruling political party in a single party state, it has sought to create an illusion that Uganda is a noparty state	Okuva ekibiina kya NRM bwe kitali kya bya bufuzi mu butongole, wadde nga kikolanga ekibiina ky'eby'obufuzi ekikola, kireeseewo endowooza egamba nti Uganda terimui kibiina kya byabufuzi
Such semantics obscure the basic reality of the NRM’s partisan dominance of the political process in Uganda,” the report reads in part	"Mu bufunze, alipoota egamba ebintu ng'ebyo bikweka amazima agalaga nti ekibiina kya NRM kyefuze enkola z'eby'obufuzi mu Uganda,"""
” However when Besigye announced his candidature in 2000, Museveni declared him a deserter, meaning he was no longer a member of the Movement	Naye Besigye bwe yagamba nti agenda kwesimbawo mu mwaka gwa 2000, Museveni yagamba nti yali yadduka mu Muvumenti
So where did Museveni want him to go?	Kati olwo Museveni yali ayagala agende wa?
But after the elections, NRM officials announced that the Movement had won	Naye oluvannyuma lw'okulonda, abakungu ba NRM baalangirira nti Ekibiina kya Muvumenti kye kisinze
The Constituent Assembly elections in 1994 were conducted on individual merit under the allinclusive Movement	Okulonda kwa Constituent Assembly okwaliwo mu 1994 kwesigama ku busobozi bwa buli muntu nga mwotwalidde Ekibiina kya Muvumenti
The book says some EC top officials were representatives or agents of companies which were doing business with the Commission	Ekitabo kigambo nti abakungu b'Akakiiko k'Eby'Okulonda baali bakikiridde kampuni ezikola bizineensi n'Akakiiko ako
One example was Lithotec, a South African company, which was contracted to print ballot papers for the EC in 2001	Ekyokulabirako kye kya kampuni ya Lithotec eya South Africa eyaweebwa omulimu gw'okukuba obukonge mu mwaka gwa 2001
One of the EC top officials, whom the book names, was the company’s business representative and indeed it won the contract	Omu ku bakungu b'ekitongole ky'eby'Okulonda  ekitabo gwe kyayatuukiriza amannya yali akiikirira kampuni eyo era omulimu gwa giweebwa
The parliamentary committee which investigated the 2001 election violence in 2002 discovered that more than half of the EC senior staff were not qualified	Akakiiko ka Palamenti akaanoonyereza ku muvuyo ogwali mu kulonda kwa 2001, mu mwaka gwa 2002 kaakizuula nti okusukka mu kimu kya kubiri eky'abakungu b'ekitongole ky'Eby'Okulonda tebaalina bisaanyizo
The book cites several cases of fraud in procurement deals which were carried out even after the government contracted SWIPCO, a Swiss procurement company, had advised A military squad called Black Mamba lays siege on the High Court after the judge had released treason suspects on bail on November 16, 2005	Ekitabo ky'ogera ku bulyake obwaliwo nga ne gavumenti emaze okuwa kampuni ya SWIPCO omulimu, ng'eno ye kampuni ya Swiss enfunira gavumenti eby'amaguzi, yawa amagezi ekibinja ky'amagye ekya Black Mamba okugumba ku kooti enkulu ng'omulamuzi amaze okuta ku kakalu abateeberezebwa okulya mu gavumenti olukwe  nga Novemba 16,  2005
The indictment on the EC incompetence is reinforced by the findings of the Supreme Court in 2001 and 2006  which showed the Electoral Commission could not be trusted to deliver free and fair elections	Ebyayogerwa ku bunafu bw'akakiiko k'Eby'Okulonda bisibwako essira mu ebyo ebyazuulibwa kooti ensukkulumu mu 2001 ne 2006 ekyalaga nti Akakiiko k'Eby'okulonda kaali tekayinza kussibwamu bwesige kutegeka kulonda okw'amazima n'obw'enkanya
In his Mustard Seed, Museveni says that lack of trust is a big impediment to the democratisation process	Mu kitabo kye ekya Mustard Seed, Museveni agamba nti obutali bwesigwa kizibu ky'amaanyi mu kuba n'enkola ya demokulase
“Not to be trusted is the greatest strategic handicap for any political group,” Museveni writes	"Museveni awandiika nti ""obutali bwesigwa kye kintu ekikyasinzeyo okulemesa ebibiina by'obufuzi"
Yet he has rejected the opposition and civil society organisations’ demands to dissolve the EC well knowing that the public has lost faith in it	Kyokka ayagaanye okuwuliriza okusaba kwa ab'oludda oluvuganya n'abantu ababulijjo okugyawo Akakiiko k'Okulonda ng'amanyi nti abantu tebakyakakkiririzaamu
Our country has gone through a traumatic experience for the last twenty or so years, mainly because Obote and Amin had no respect for the rule of law	Ensi yaffe eyise mu katuubagiro akamanyi emyaka abiri oba n'okusingawo olwo'kuba Obote Amin tebaagoberera mateeka
Nobody has the right to take away a person’s life, freedom or property except within the due process of the law,” Museveni said passionately at the seminar	Tewali alina buyinza kutta muntu, okutyoboola eddembe ly'obuntu oba okwonoona ebintu by'abalala ng'amateeka bwe galagira, bw'atyo Museveni bwe yayogera mu lukungaana
However this contrasts sharply with the Museveni who ordered the rearrest of Besigye and his 21 coaccused who had been duly released on bail by the High Court in Kampala on November 16, 2005	Kyokka kino kikontana ne Museveni eyalagira baddemu basibe Besigye ne banne 21 abaali baateebwa ku kakalu ka Kooti Enkulu mu Kampala nga Novemba 16, 2005
His soldiers, like Obote’s and Amin’s armies, deprived the suspects of their liberty contrary to his promise at the law seminar in 1987	Okufaananako abasirikale ba Obote ne Amini, abasirikale be bagyako abawawabirwa eddembe lyabwe nga kino kitontana ne kye yasuubiza mu lukungaana lw'amateeka olwaliwo mu 1987
In February 2002 two opposition supporters Peter Oloya Yumbe and Steven Olanya were arrested on charges of murdering Alfred Bongomin, the Movement chairman for Pabbo in Gulu	Mu Febwali wa 2002 abali ku ludda oluvuganya ababiri Peter Oloya Yumbe ne Steven Olanya baasibwa olw'okutemula Alfred Bongomin, sentebe w'Ekibiina kya Muvumenti mu Pabbo Gulu
In his “Ours is a Fundamental Change” Museveni had stated: “No regime has a right to kill or beat any citizen of this country	"Okuyitira mu ""Ours is a Fundamental Change” Museveni yali agambye nti: ""Tewali mulembe gukkirizibwa kukuba omutuuze yenna ow'omu nsi eno"
” However, for Yumbe’s murder by Museveni’s soldiers, the government did not even investigate the case	Kyokka amagye ba Museveni bwe gatta Yumbe, gavumenti teyafaayo ku kunoonyereza ku musango ogwo
Olanya and Penytoo were released but later rearrested on March 9, 2005	Olanya ne Penytoo baateebwa ate oluvannyuma ne bakatibwa nga Maaki 9, 2005
When the police were about to release them, the UPDF grabbed them again and took them to the military barracks where they were joined by another opposition supporter Ochan Laryang	Poliisi bwe yali eneetera okubata, abasirikale ba UPDF baabasikambula ne babatwala mu nkambi y'amagye gye beegatirwako Ochan omuwangizi w'oludda oluvuganya
The suspects were transferred to Kampala and charged with murder of Ochaya, Kitgum RDC, who police said was killed in 2002	Abawawabirwa baatwalibwa e Kampala ne bateekebwako omusango gw'okutta Ochaya, omukulembeze wa Disitulikiti e Kitigumu, poliisi gwe yagamba nti yattibwa mu 2002
One month later the police said the suspects had killed Alfred Bongomin in Gulu, not Ochaya	Oluvannyuma lw'omwezi gumu poliisi yagamba nti abawawabirwa batta Alfred Bongomin mu Gulu so si Ochaya
Then the state arrested MPs Michael Ocula and Reagan Okumu and charged them with killing Bongomin	Ate abasirikale baakwata Omubaka awa palimenti Micheal Ocula ne Reagan Okumu ne babateekako omusango gw'okutta Bongomin
One day a man came to her home and told her that the state had heard that she was planning to report to the Uganda Human Rights Commission (UHRC)	Lumu omusajja yajja awakawe n'amugamba gavumenti yali ewulidde nti ategeka okubawawabira mu Kitongole ky'Eddembe ry'Omuntu mu Uganda
He warned that the day she would report to UHRC was the day she would die	Yamulabula nti olunaku lwaliwaaba mu Kitongole ky'Eddembe ry'Omuntu mu Uganda lwalifiirako
She has never reported to UHRC	Nokutuusa leero, tawaabanga mu Kitongole ky'Eddembe ry'Omuntu mu Uganda
Frank Atukunda was arrested for subversion and taken to a garage at Arua Presidential Lodge	Franka Atukunda yakwatibwa n'atwalibwa ku garagi mu Arua Presidetial Lodge olw'okusekeeterera gavumenti
A military intelligence officer called Drani led the beatings and told the suspects they did not deserve to live	Omukungu w'amagye ayitibwa Drani yakulemberamu okukuba era n'agamba abawawabirwa nti baagwana kufa
He would tell them Museveni is “a good parent and whoever opposes him deserves to die	"Yabagambanga nti Museveni ""muzadde mulungi era nti amuwakanya asaana kufa"
” Drani is still in CMI, The Independent has established	Drani akyali mu CMI,  bwe lutyo olupapula lw'amawule The Independent bwe lugamba
Another intelligence officer Arnold Kajjo, a relative of Security Minister Amama Mbabazi, would use big sticks to hit the suspects	Omukungu w'Amagye omulala Arnold Kajjo, alina oluganda ku Minisita w'Eby'Okwerinda Amama Mbabaz yakozesa omuggo omunnene okukuba abawawabirwa
Patrick Mamenero was arrested from Kabale for alleged subversion	Patrick Mamenero yakwatibwa e Kabale olw'okusekeeterera gavumenti
He died in CMI detention on July 23, 2002	Yafiira mu kadduukulu ka CMI nga Jjulaayi 23, 2002
Noble Mayombo told the press that Mamenero had died of malaria	Noble Mayombo yagamba abamawulire nti Mamenero yali afudde omusujja gw'ensiri
Mamenero had been detained with his father	Mamenero yali sibiddwa ne kitaawe
From Museveni’s early days of the struggle, he was resolute that sorting out the A death certificate of Patrick Mamenero from Kabale district who was arrested by soldiers for alleged subversion and killed at CMI in 2002	Okuviira ddala ku ntandikwa y'olutalo lwa Museveni, yali amaliridde okunoonya ekiwandiiko ekiraga enfa ya Patrick Mamenero okuva mu disitulikiti y'e Kabale yakwatibwa abasirikale ng'ateeberezebwa okusekeeterera gavumenti era yatibbwa mu CMI mu mwaka gwa 2002
In his Selected Articles on the Uganda Resistance War  1985, Museveni said: “There is quite a lot of misconception not only on the question of Uganda but also on many African issues	Mu biwandiiko bye ebimu eby'ogerwa ku Uganda Resistance War olwa 1985, Museveni yagamba nti waliwo endowooza enkyamu si ku Uganda yokka naye era ne ku nsonga z'Afirika nnyingi
”However in 2005 after the constitution had been controversially amended amidst accusations that he had bribed parliament to pass the amendment removing presidential term limits, Museveni changed his previous statement and told the press: “You wasted a lot of time and power discussing kisanja (presidential tenure)	"Kyokka mu 2005 oluvunnyuma lw'ebbago lya Ssemateeka okukyusibwamu wakati w'oluvuuvumo nti alidde olukwe mu Palamenti esobole okukyusa ebisanja by'obwa pulezidenti bibeeko ekkomo, Museveni yakuysa ebigambo bye ebyasooka n'agamba bannamawulire nti; ""Mwonoonye ebiseera bingi n'amaanyi nga mwogera ku kisanja (okukyusa pulesidenti)"
From then onwards Museveni started saying that Uganda’s fundamental problem was in fact economic development and serious people should talk about things like poverty alleviation and industrialisation	Okuva olwo n'okweyongerayo, Museveni yatandika okugamba nti ekizibu kya Uganda ekikulu kyali nkulankulana mu by'enfuna era abantu ab'amagezi bandyogedde ku bintu ng'ogyawo obwavu n'okutandikawo amakolero

Ministers Bidandi Ssali, Eriya Kategaya, Miria Matembe, Amanya Mushega and Sarah Nakiyingi who opposed the change of the constitution were dropped from Cabinet	Ba minisita; Bidandi Ssali, Eriya Kategaya, Miria Matembe, Amanya Mushega and Sarah Nakiyingi abaawakanya eby'okukyusa Ssemateeka bagibwako ku kabindo ka ba minisita
Then Museveni’s cheerleaders started choruses calling for him to rule for life	Olwo abawagizi ba Museveni baatandika okugamba nti ajja kufuga obulamu bwe bwonna
At a rally in Sembabule in January 2004, four cabinet ministers and 20 MPs danced for the third term for Museveni	Mu lukungana e Ssembabule mu Janwali wa 2004, ba minisita bana n'ababaka ba Palamenti 20 baazina olw'ekisaanja kya Museveni ekyokusatu

Khiddu Makubuya changes goal postsKizza Besigye’s arrest on treason and rape charges on November 14, 2005 threw his presidential candidature into balance	Kiddhu Makubuya akyusa ekigendererwa n'alaga nti Kizza Besigye bwe yakwatibwa ku misango gy'okulya mu nsi olukwe n'okukwata omukazi egyaliwo nga Noveemba 14, 2005 gyateeka okwesimbawo kwe ku bwa pulezidenti mu lusuubo
The Electoral Commission sought the opinion of the Attorney General, Khiddu Makubuya	Akakiiko k'Ebyokulonda kaasemba ekirowoozo ky'Omuwoleleza wa gavumenti Kiddu Makubuya
Makubuya was a member of the commission set up by Museveni in 1987 to investigate human rights abuses from 1962 to 1986	makubuya yali mmemba w'akakiiko akatekebwawo Museveni mu 1987 okunoonyereza ku ddembe ly'obuntu eryalinnyirirwa okuva mu 1962 okutuuka mu 1986
Makubuya, then an associate professor of law at Makerere University, disagreed with his fellow commissioners on some issues and wrote a minority report	Makubuya eyali omukugu w'amateeka ku Yunivasite e makerere teyakkiriziganya na bakugu banne  ku nsonga ezimu era n'awandiika alipoota ye
However, on Besigye’s case, he turned his statement on its head and said that the FDC leader’s candidature should be blocked because the treason charge had placed his level of innocence below that of other candidates	Wadde nga ku nsonga ya Besigye yakyusa bye yayogera nti eyala yeesimbyewo okuva mu kibiina kya FDC asaana okuyimirizibwa kubanga omusango gw'okulya mu nsi olukwe gwakkakanya nnyo ekifo kye bw'ogerageranya n'abo abaali beesimbyewo okuva mu bibiina ebirala
The book also captures the various episodes in Besigye’s trial both in the High Court and military court and the protracted struggle by Besigye’s lawyers to stop the arbitrary prosecution by the state	Ekitabo era ky'ogera ku bintu ebirala ebyaliwo mu musango gwa Besigye mu kooti enkulu ne mu kooti y'amagye era n'olutalo lwa balooya ba Besigye okukomya efugabbi
The book then delves into how the state blocked Besigye’s brother Musasizi Kifefe from getting proper treatment and in time, leading to his eventual death	Ekitabo era kyogera ku ngeri muganda wa Besigye Musasizi Kifefe gye yaziyizibwamu okufuna obujjajjabi obutuufu mu kiseera ekituufu, ekyamuviirako okufa
It places Kifefe’s death at the hands of the state	kino kiranga nti okufa kwa Kifefe kyava ku gavumenti
The author borrows from Museveni’s explanation in 2003 when he was justifying why he had lent his presidential jet to fly his daughter abroad to give birth instead of taking her to local public hospitals	Omuwandiisi yeyazika ebyannyonnyolwa Museveni mu mwaka gwa 2003 nga yeewozaako lwaki yakkiriza ennyonnyi y'obwa pulezidenti okutwala muwala we ebweru okuzaala mu kifo ky'okumutwala mu malwaliro ga gavumenti
According to Museveni, the book suggests, the possibility of poisoning a vulnerable prisoner like Musasizi in prison is real in Uganda	Okusinziira ku Museveni, ekitabo kigamba nti okuwa obutwa omusibe atalina buyambi nga Musasizi mukkomera mu Uganda kisoboka
The author narrates the various attempts by the family to get a medical report for Musasizi’s bail application in court and how doctors and administrators of Mulago Hospital refused to release it citing fear for their lives	Omuwandiisi attottola emirundi ab'omu nju gye baagezaako okufuna alipoota y'obujjanjabi okusaba kooti okuta Musaasizi ku kakalu era n'engeri abasawo n'abakulu b'eddwaliro ly'e Mulago gye baagaana okugibawa olw'okutya okussa obulamu bwabwe mu matigga
According to Museveni, the book suggests, the possibility of poisoning a vulnerable prisoner like Musasizi in prison is real in Uganda	 Okusinziira ku Museveni, ekitabo kigamba nti okuwa obutwa omusibe atalina buyambi nga Musasizi mukkomera mu Uganda kisoboka
It bears a picture of Museveni in military uniform with an assault rifle, an image of militarism in Uganda’s politics	Kiraga ekifaananyi kya Museveni ng'ali mu byambalo by'amagye n'emundu, ekifaananyi ekiraga amagye okuyingizibwa mu by'obufuzi bya Uganda
It holds Museveni against his every promise in Sowing the Mustard Seed and concludes that his political accountability has fallen flat	"Museveni tanyweredde ku bisuubizo bye nga bwe kirambikiddwa mu ""Mustard seed"" ne kifundikirwa nti eby'obufuzi bwe biremereddwa"
Critics have pointed at the confiscation of the book as another sign of the growing intolerance of dissenting views by the Museveni regime	Abanonooza bogedde ku kuwambibwa kw'ekitabo ng'akamu ku bubonero obulaga obuzibu mu kuwa endowooza mu mulembe gwa Museveni
With less than five months to the general elections next year in which Museveni and Besigye are likely to be candidates, human rights advocates are worried about the erosion of basic freedoms of speech, association, and the right to information	Ng'ebula emyezi egitasukka mu etaano okulonda kwa bonna kutuuke omwaka ogugya omuli Musevwni ne Besigye ng'abavuganya, Aba Besigye kirabika bajja kwesimbawo, abalwanirizi b'eddembe ly'obuntu beeraliikirivu olw'okulinyirirwa lw'eddembe ly'okwogera, ely'okukolagana n'eddembe ly'okumanya
Legislators including Kitgum Women’s Member of Parliament Beatrice Atim Anywar objected to the introduction of the bill before the tabling of the more comprehensive law to govern the industry, the Petroleum Act	Bannamateeka nga mw'otwalidde n'omubaka omukyala akiikirira ab'e Kitgum mu Palamenti Beatrice Atim Anywar  baawakanya eky'okuyisa ekiteeso nga tebanaba kuteekawo teeka erifuga ekitongole, etteeka ly'amafuta
By delaying the introduction of the Petroleum Act, the government is “overlooking the foundations of a solid and accountable system,” said Atim	"Olw'okulwawo okuleeta ebbago ly'amafuta, gavumenti ""ebuusizza amaaso enkola enywevu era eyesigika"" Atim bw'agamba"

Just a few days later officials including the Minister of Investment Aston Kajara contradicted him, saying that a final decision had not yet been made on whether the government had rejected Tullow’s preemption of the sale	Ngawakayita ennaku ntono oluvanyuma lw'abakungu nga mw'otwalidde Minisita w'eby'okusiga ensimbi Aston Kajara bamuwakanya, nga bagamba nti okusalawo okusembayo tekunnaba kkolebwa oba gavumenti egaana ekiteeso kya kampuni ya Tullow ku by'okutunda
According to some reports, the company had received a letter from the Permanent Secretary of Energy, Kabagambe Kaliisa, giving it permission to go ahead with its plan of paying Heritage and depositing the tax claimed by the government in an escrow account in London	Okusinziira ku alipoota ezimu, kampuni yali efunye ebbaluwa okuva ew'omuwandiisi ow'enkalakkalira mu kitongole ky'amasanyalaze n'obuggagga obw'ensibo, Kabagambe Kaliisa ng'abawa olukkusa okugenda mu maaso n'enteekateeka zaakyo e'zokusasula Heritage n'omusolo ogubanjibwa gavumenti mu akawunti e London
The current chaos in the management of the industry points to a problem at the top, according to Dickens Kamugisha, of the Africa Institute for Energy Governance	Obukuubagano obulimu bakulembeze b'ekkolero busonga ku kizibu ekyamaanyi okusinziira ku Dickens Kamugisha, ava mu kitongole kya Africa Institute for Energy Governance
“All this confusion we are seeing is the result of one man trying to manage everything,” said Kamugisha	Okubuzaabuzibwa kuno kwonna kwe tulaba kuvudde ku muntu omu okugezaako okuddukanya buli kimu, bwatyo Kamugisha bw'agamba
He clamped down on officials jumping his signal with a letter to Minister Onek declaring that no oil deals were to be signed without written presidential consent	Yagaana abakungu abaasambajja okulabula okwali mu bbaluwa okugamba nti tewali kiwandiiko ky'amafuta ekijja okussibwako omukono nga pulezidenti takkiriza
As Kamugisha says, “From the start, Museveni is creating the impression that he is so powerful, that ‘You companies can’t survive without my say	Nga Kamugisha bw'agamba, okuva ku ntandikwa Museveni ateekawo embeera eraga nti w'amaanyi nnyo; 'kampuni tezisobola kubaawa awatali kigambo kyange
It’s clear that the government, especially President Yoweri Museveni, blames Tullow for letting Heritage get away without paying the US$404 million the government claims in tax	Kyeyoleka kaati nti gavumenti okusingira ddala pulezidenti Yoweri Museveni anenya Tullow olw'okuleka Heritage okusaanawo nga obukadde 404 obwa ddoola tebusasuddwa ng'omusolo gwa gavumenti

Musumba has been Buzaaya County MP since 1996	Musumba abadde mubaka wa palimenti owa Buzaaya okuva mu 1996
It was therefore a shock that he lost to little known LCV councillor Martin Muzaale	N'olwekyo kyantiisa okufiirwa Martin Muzaale omukulembeze wa Disitulikiti
Musumba and Menhya were reluctant to discuss their defeat, but Kiyingi, who rose to prominence in 2006 after handing FDC’s Eastern Region Vice Chairperson Salaamu Musumba a shock defeat, is not taking the loss lightly	Musumba ne Menhya tebeefirayo kukubaganya birowoozo ku kulemererwa kwabwe naye Kiyingi eyatutumuka mu 2006 oluvannyuma lw'okuwaayo Salaamu Omumyuka wa Ssentebe w'ekibiina kya FDC mu Kiitundu eky'Ebuvanjuba
But if his 2006 election feat surprised Busoga, the NRM Returning Officer Sanubi Namusisi’s announcement on September 7 that Kiyingi had lost to former Makerere University guild president, Henry Maurice Kibalya, left Busoga shell shocked	Naye singa okulondebwa kwe okwa 2006 kwewuunyisa Busoga, omukungu wa NRM Sanubi Namusisibwe yalangirira mu  Ssebutemba 7 nti Kiyingi awanguddwa ng'ono yeyali omukulu w'abayizi e Makerere, Henry Maurice Kibalya kyewuunyisa Busoga
Kibalya got 17,171 votes and Kiyingi, 16,974	 Kibalya yafuna obululu 17,171 ate Kiyinga 16,974
The returning officer was under strict instructions to fix the results in favour of my opponent,” Kiyingi claims	Kiyingi agamba nti,omukungu alangirira ebivudde mu kulonda yagambibwa okuwagira amuvuganya
Who issued the instructions to have the results fixed?  He claims it’s Kadaga	Ani yawa ekiragiro okufulumya ebivuddemu? Yagamba nti yali Kadaga
He says Kadaga should not have supported Moses Kizige against Menhya in Bugabula North, Kibalya against him in Bugabula South and Martin Muzaale against Isaac Musumba in Buzaaya	Agamba Kadaga teyandiwagidde Moses Kizige avuvuganya ne Menhya e Bugabula w'e Bukiika kkono, yavuganya Kibalya mu Bukiika ddyo wa Bugabula ne Martin Muzaale n'avuganya Isaac
All those who allegedly had Kadaga’s backing won the primaries	Abo bonna abaawagirwa Kadaga baawangula akalulu ak'okususula
Government and NRM Chief Whip, Daudi Migereko, doubts the allegations against Kadaga	Gavumenti n'omukungu w'ekibiina kya NRM, Daudi Migereko babuusabuusa emisango gye baateeka ku Kadaga
He says it is normal for new entrants to approach an established leader, like Kadaga, about their intentions	Agamba nti kya bulijjo abapya okutuukirira abakulembeze abateekebwawo nga Kadaga ku bikwata ku biruubirwa byabwe
Former Iganga LCV Chairman George Patrick Bageya, says that protracted fights have always existed among Busoga’s leaders since 1986	Eyali Ssentebbe wa Disitulikiti ya Iganga Patrick Bageya agamba nti obukuubagano bubaddengawo mu bufuzi bwa Busoga okuva mu mu 1986
He says former Vice President Speciosa Kazibwe ganged up with Kadaga to fight Kirunda Kivejinja who was viewed as Busoga’s undisputed political leader	Agamba nti Specioza kazibwe eyali omumyuka w'omukulembeze yeekoobaana ne kadaga okulwanyisa Kirunda Kivejinja eyali atwalibwa nga omukulembeze w'ebyobufuzi ow'e Busonga owa nnamaddala
The friction between Kadaga and Kivejinja remained even after Kazibwe quit cabinet	Akakuubangano wakati wa Kadaga ne Kivejinja kaasigala wadde nga Kazibwe yava mu lukiiko lwa baminisita
Bageya says the infighting led to the emergence of strong opposition politicians like Abdul Katuntu	Bageya agamba nti obukuubagano bwaleetawo bannabyabufuzi abavuganya nga Abdul Katuntu
Bageya says Katuntu was introduced by Kadaga and supported by Kazibwe to defeat Kivejinja	Bageya agamba nti Katuntu yaletebwa Kadaga era n'alagirwa Kazibwe okuwangula Kivejinja
How can three men claim that they were defeated because of one woman?	Abasajja basatu basobola batya okuganga nti omukazi omu yabalemesa?
She argues Kiyingi was defeated because of refusing to support Prince William Gabula’s claim to the Kyabazinga’s throne	Agamba Kiyingi yawangulwa olw'okuba yagaana okuwagira omulangira William Gabula eyasaba entebe ya Kyabazinga
"""I would side with Kadaga if at all she fought him,” Musumba said."	"Musumba yagamba nti ""Ajja kuwagira Kadaga singa amulwanyisa"""
Kiyingi’s case is one of the several cases that are to be reviewed by a joint team the NRM formed to review and resolve electoral disputes, but the committee has not held a single meeting yet	Omusango gwa Kiyingi gwe gumu ku misango egigenda okutunulwamu akakiiko akaawamu akatondebwawo ekibiina kya NRM  okwekenneenya n'okuganjoola enkayana z'eby'okulonda, naye akakiiko kaali tekannatuuza lukiiko lwonna
Even if the committee eventually visited Kamuli, can it indict Kadaga, a member of the party’s Central Executive Committee and  Deputy Speaker of parliament? 	Wadde ng'akakiiko kaagenda e Kamuli, kaali kasobola okuemesa Kadaga memba w'akakiiko Akafuzi ak'ekibiina era  Omumyuka w'Omwogezi wa palamenti?
In 2008 the two politicians also disagreed over how Kiyingi handled the petition Kadaga lodged before the parliament’s committee on rules, privileges and discipline, accusing Kibuku MP  Saleh Kamba of defamation	Mu mwaka gwa 2008, bannabya bufuzi era tebakkiriziganya ku ngeri Kiyingi gye yakwatamu omusango gwa Kadaga gwe yawaaba mu kakiiko ka palamenti ogukwata ku mateeka, enkizo n'empisa, nga bavunaana omubaka wa palamenti ow'e Kibuku Saleh Kamba okwonoona erinnya ly'abala
During an NRM parliamentary caucus  meeting, Kamba had accused Kadaga of having facilitated Katuntu to defeat Kivejinja in the November 2007 byelections for Bugweri parliamentary seat	Mu lukungana lw'akabondo k'ababaka ba NRM, Kamba yanenya Kadaga olw'okuwagira katuntu n'awangula Kiveijinja mu kulonda okwaddibwamu mu Novemba 2007 okw'ekifo ky'omubaka wa palamenti e Bugwere
Parliamentary sources say Kiyingi advised Kadaga to get a different person to present the petition rather herself	Ebiva mu palamenti bigamba nti Kiyingi awa Kadaga amagezii okufuna abantu ab'enjawulo okuwaaba mu kifo kye ye okuwaaba
This was to save Kadaga from  appearing as a complainant, prosecutor and judge since she is Deputy Speaker of parliament	Kino kyali kya kutangira kadaga okuba omuwaabi, looya era omulamuzi okuva bwe yali  omumyuka w'Omwogezi wa palimenti
Salaamu Musumba is preparing to stand again in Kamuli.	Salaamu Musumba ateekateeka okuddamu okwesimbawo mu Kamuli

Moses Kisolo Wojega has given way for his rival Mutwalibi Zandya Mafabi to carry the party’s flag in next year’s elections	Moses Kisoro Wojega alekedde amuvuganya Mutwalibi Zandya Mafabi bbendera y'ekibiina mu kulonda okunabaawo mu mwaka ogujja
The votes Zandya received from the two divisions exceeded the number of registered voters	Obululu Zandya bwe yafuna businga omuwendo gw'abalonzi abeewawandiisa
According FDC officials the party investigated and found the allegations were correct.	Okusinziira ku bakungu b'ekibiina kya FDC okunoonyereza n'emisango egyazuulibwa bituufu
Kisolo won the fresh elections  held on Oct 10 but Zandya refused to concede defeat.	Kisolo yawangula okulonda okwaddibwamu nga Okutobba 10 naye Zandya yagaana okukkiriza obuwanguzi obwo
However Richard Kudeeba, the FDC district electoral commissioner, said Zandya had been duly informed	Naye Richard Kudeeba owa FDC akulira eby'okulonda mu Disitulikiti yagamba nti Zandya yali yagambibwa dda
They convened a meeting and tasked Budadiri East MP Nandala Mafabi to mediate and persuade Kisolo to step down for Zandya	Baakola olukiiko ne bagamba omubaka w'e Budaadiri ey'e buvanjuba Nandala Mafabi okusendasenda Kisoro okulekera Zandya ekifo
Kisolo was Nandala’s driver.	Kisolo yali dereeva wa Nandala.
Kisolo says he yielded because people were complaining that the Bagisu from Budadiri were taking over all the positions in Mbale	Kisoro agamba nti yafunamu kubanga abantu baali beemulugunya nti Abagisu okuva e Budaadiri baali bawangula ab'oludda oluvuganya mu Mbale
Some of the prominent politicians from Budadiri include Nathan Nandala Mafabi and Jack Wamai Wamanga, the incumbent Mbale Municipality MP	Budaadiri yalimu Nathan Nandala Mafabi ne Jack Wamai Wamanga, omubaka wa palamenti owa Mbale Munisipaali
Kisolo says that his stay in the race would give credence the claims and polarise the party faithful	Kisolo agamba nti okusigala mu lw'okaano kyandiraze nti mutuufu era ne kisanyalaza obwesigwa bw'ekibiina
Party supporters, he says, of Zandya’s camp were likely not to vote Wamai in the parliamentary elections	Agamba ab'ekibiina kya Zandya baali bayinza obutalonda Wamai mu kulonda kwa palamenti
Wamai had lived abroad for over 30 years and was not well known in local politics	Wamai yali abeera bweru okumala emyaka 30 era yali tamanyiddwa mu by'obufuzi bwa wano
Kisolo played a big role in marketing his candidature to win the municipality’s parliamentary seat in the byelections earlier this year	Kisolo yakola kyamaanyi okumanyisa ekifo kye okuwangula ebifo bya palamenti mu kulonda okwaddibwamu ku ntandikwa y'omwaka guno
Kisolo has now turned his eyes on the seat for chairman of Industrial Division in the municipality.	Kisolo kati atunuulira kifo ky'obwa Ssentebbe w'eby'amakolero mu bendobendo lya munisupaali
The meeting will determine whether a rerun should be held or the party upholds the disputed results that would make Nagudi the official flag bearer	Olukungana lugya kusalawo oba nga okulonda kuddibwamu oba ekibiina kisazaamu enkaayana ezatuusa Nagudi okuba nga y'akwata bendera y'ekibiina
Mugarura confirmed that the party had investigated the alleged malpractices in the recently concluded primaries for Mbale Woman MP and discovered that in some places the votes exceeded the number of registered voters	Mugarura yakakasa nti ekibiina kinoonyereza kwebyo ebyali byogerwa ku kukuba akalulu ak'okusunsulamu akaali kakagwa ak'omubaka wa palamenti ow'abakyala e Mbale era kyazuulibwa nti mu bifo ebimu obululu bwassuka omuwendo gw'abalonzi abeewandiisa
Last week, Kudeeba told The Independent  that the party had  decided to uphold the initial election results that made Nagudi the winner	Wiiki ewedde, Kudeeba yagamba ab'olupapula lwa Independent nti ekibiina kyali kisazeewo okugenda mu maaso n'ebyava mu  kulonda ebyasooka ebyawanguza Nagudi
However, Mugarura insisted the party had not yet named the flag bearer for the Woman MP seat by October 19	Naye Mugalura yalemerako nti ekibiina kyali tekinnalonda muntu mu kifo ky'omubaka wa palamenti nga Okutoba 19
Francis Mwijukye, a committee member on the party’s Information and Publicity Department, said 80 voters were held at the FDC district chairman’s home on the day of the voting.

Tayebwa said he would petition the party.	Tayebwa yangamba nti ajja kuwabira ekibiina
Mwijukye says Tayebwa is a member of the party’s National Executive Committee and one of the founding members	Mwijukye agamba nti Tayebwa y'omu ku ba mmemba b'ekibiina abali ku kakiiko akakulu era y'omu ku bakitandikawo
He said Tayebwa is a huge political asset to the FDC and the party would exhaust all avenues to ensure his grievances are addressed appropriately	Yagamba nti Tayebwa munnabyabufuzi owomugaso ennyo mu FDC eraekibiina kisobola okutema empenda eziyitwamu okukakasa nti okwemulugunya kwe kukolwako bulungi
However Mugisha told The Independent that she had met with Besigye over the election irregularities in Nakawa Division where she is standing for FDC flag bearer for the parliamentary seat	Naye Mugisha yagamba ab'olupapula lwa The Independent nti yali asisinkanye Besigye ku bikwata ku mivuyo egiri mu kulonda mu ggombolola y'e Nakawa gye yeesimbiddewo ng'omukwasi wa bendera y'ekibiina kya FDC
She is locked in a wrangle with Michael Kabaziguruka, another party stalwart in Nakawa	Ali mu katuubagano ne Michael Kabaziguruka, eyali omuwagizi lukulwe ow'ekibiia kirala mu Nakawa
The party Secretary General Alice Alaso had said the election in Nakawa was being handled at the highest level	Ssabawandiisi w'ekibiina Alice Alaso yali agambye nti okulonda mu Nakawa kugenda bukwakku
Mugisha says Besigye rarely involves himself in party wrangles over who is elected where or gets what, a style different from President Museveni’s system	Mugisha agamba nti Besigye tatera kwenyigira mu bukuubagano bw'abo abalondebwa oba kye bafuna, enkola eyawukana ku ya Pulezidenti Museveni
Museveni would meet disgruntled supporters and try to persuade them to give up by promising them compensation in terms of jobs or business	Museveni yandisisikanye abatuuze abaali beemulugunya era n'agezaako okubawooyawooya ng'abasuubiza okubawa emirimu oba bizineensi
In 2006 Dr Besigye received his first test when opposition members of parliament disagreed on who would become their leader of opposition between Sam Njuba and Prof. Ogenga Latigo	Mu mwaka gwa 2006 Dr. Besigye yafuna okusoomooza abaali ku ludda oluvuganya gavumenti mu palamenti bwe batakkaanya ku ani eyandibadde omukulembeze wabwe ow'oludda oluvuganya wakati wa Sam Njuba ne pulofeesa Ogenga Latigo

An important feature of the recently concluded NRM election primaries was the violence and fraud that characterised the process across almost the entire country	Okulonda kw'ekibiina kya NRM kubaddemu obukambwe n'obulimba obufuuse obw'olulango kumpi mu nsi yonna
This produced a large number of aggrieved NRM politicians who have declared they want to run as independents	Kino kyavaamu bannabyabufuzi ba NRM  bangi okunyiikaala era ne bagamba nti baagala kwesimbawo ku bwannamunigina
President Yoweri Museveni had previously sought to treat them as rebels and threatened to expel them from the NRM	Pulesidenti Musevini yali asazeewo okubatwala nga bakyewaggula era n'atiisatiisa okubagoba mu kibiina kya NRM.
However, after meeting the party’s parliamentary caucus, many of whose members lost in the primaries, Museveni altered his stance and allowed them to run as independents	Naye oluvannyuma lw'okusisinkana bamemba b'ekibiina ab'akabondo ka palamenti, yakyusa endowooza ye n'asalawo abaleke beesimbewo bwannamunigina nga tebalina kibiina mwebajjidde.
Given the multitude of losers in the NRM primary, this was a smart move by the party president	Olw'okuba baali bangi nnyo abaali batayiseemu ku kusunsulibwa kw'ekibiina kya NRM, pulezidenti kye yakola kyali kya magezi nnyo.
Museveni may have been afraid that if he refused them to run as independents, many would have toed with the idea of joining the opposition	Museveni ayinza okuba nga yatya nti singa abagaana okwesimbawo ku lwabwe, bayinza okusala eddiiro ne badda ku ludda oluvuganya gavumenti.
Consequently, we are likely to have an independent candidate in almost every constituency in Uganda	N'olwekyo, kirabika tujja kuba n'abo abeesimbyewo ku lwabwe kumpi mu buli disitulikiti.
It is also possible that most independents will be from the NRM	Era kisoboka okuba nti abannesimbawo ku lwabwe abasinga obungi bajja kuba ba mu kibiina kya NRM.
This means that NRM will most probably have two candidates in every constituency	Kino kiba kitegeeza nti NRM eyinza okuba n'abeesimbyewo mu konsituwensi abawera ababiri.
Given that the opposition seems unable to field candidates in all constituencies, the real race in most of Uganda will be NRM running against NRM	Olw'okuba oludda oluvuganya gavumenti terusobola kusimbawo babaka mu konsituwensi zonna, kirabika aba NRM bajja kuba bavuganya na ba NRM bannaabwe.
This means that even if NRM had not opened up to multiparty politics, its internal power struggles would have created an inevitable multiparty situation	Kino kiba kitegeeza nti NRM ne bwetandikkiriza byabufuzi eby'ebibiina ebingi, obukuubagano obuli munda mu kyo mwenyini  bwenditaddewo embeera eringa ey'ebibiina ebingi.
The inability of the opposition parties to attract disgruntled NRM politicians is not because of lack of ideological support	Eky'ab'oludda oluvuganya gavumenti okulemererwa okusikiriza aba NRM abatali bamativu tekyesigamye ku kuba nti tebalina birowoozo birungi.
We know that most NRM politicians share the sentiments of opposition parties regarding endemic corruption, incompetence and mismanagement of this nation	Tukimanyi bulungi nti abasinga obungi ku abo abali mu NRM nabo balina endowoozo ng'eya abo abali ku ludda oluvuganya gavumenti ku bikwata ku buli bw'enguzi, ku butaba na bumanyirivu ne ku ngeri etali nnungi eggwanga lino gye likulembeddwamu.
Therefore, the challenge for us intellectually is how to explain NRM’s ability to retain a large number of followers among the leadership of this country even in the face of widespread discontent among them	Naye ekitulemye okutegeera ye ngeri NRM gy'erina abawagizi abangi
Museveni has ensured that NRM is able to exhibit and project some form of democratic character	Museveni akoze kyonna ekisoboka okukakasa nti wabaawo enkola eyeefanaanyiriza enfuga ya demokulasiya.
By allowing regular internal elections, he has created opportunities for many people seeking to climb the ladders of power inside NRM to do so	olw'okuba akkirizza okulonda okubaawo mu kibiina entakera, bangi abawadde akakisa okulinya amadaala g'obukulembeze mu kibiina kya NRM.
More critically, Museveni understands that an election is a time to test a politician’s popular standing	Museveni akimanyi bulungi nnyo nti okulonda kiba kiseera kya kugezesa obuganzi munnabyabufuzi bw'aba alina mu bantu.
But he also needs NRM to have a big win in every election in order to sustain the myth of his personal and his political party’s invincibility	Naye era ayagala NRM ewangulire waggulu esobole okuba ng'esukuluma ku bibiina ebirala.
This is important to discourage potential defectors in NRM from joining other opposition parties	Kino kikulu nnyo okulemesa abali mu kibiina okukivaamu ne bayingira mu bibiina ebiri ku ludda oluvuganya gavumenti.
For example, NRM has demonstrated that in western Uganda, it cannot be beaten	Ng'ekyokulabirako, NRM ekiraze nti teyinza kuwangulibwa mu Buggwanjuba bwa Uganda.
Therefore, even the most ardent critics of the NRM in Western Uganda do not join any opposition party	N'olwekyo, oli ne bw'abanga ng'avumirira nnyo NRM eyo ku ludda olw'Ebuggwanjuba, tayinza kudda ku ludda oluvuganya gavumenti.
Take the example of Alex Ruhunda who was recently elected as NRM flag bearer for Fort Portal Municipality	Ng'ekyokulabirako, lowooza ku Alex Ruhunda eyalondebwa gyebuvuddeko awo okukwatira NRM bendera mu Fort Portal.
I argued that NRM should be credited for promoting liberal economic reforms that have sustained robust growth for two decades	Nnagamba nti NRM esaanidde okusiimibwa olw'okutumbula n'okuleetawo enkyukakyuka mu by'enfuna mu myaka kkumi egiyise.
Ruhunda was angry with me for saying something positive about NRM	Ruhunda yannyigira nnyo olw'okubaako ekintu ekirungi kye njogera ku NRM.
He accused me of having been probably compromised by Museveni	Yagamba nti Museveni yangulirira.
Ruhunda’s decision had little to do with his personal character, morality and integrity as most Ugandans would argue	Abantu bangi bayinza okugamba nti ekyo Ruhunda kye yakola tekirina we kikwataganira n'engeri ye ng'omuntu, n'empisa ze era n'obwesigwa bwe.
However, if he were to have any chance of going to parliament, he could only do so as an NRM candidate and possibly hope to join some progressive faction inside the party to promote reform	Naye bw'aba ow'okugenda mu palamenti, ateekeddwa okubeera mu kibiina kya NRM era awo ab'ajja kubeera mu kabondo akakola obulungi munda mu kibiina okusobola okuleetawo enkyukakyuka.
The myth of invincibility that Museveni and NRM have cultivated over the years is the major reason disgruntled NRM politicians find it more profitable to run as independents	Endowooza y'obutawangulwa Museven n'ekibiina kya NRM ebadde egobererwa okumala emyaka mingi, y'eviiriddeko bannabyabufuzi bangi okwesimbawo ku lwabwe
It is also the reason why people who are very critical of NRM join it nonetheless	Era eyo ye nsonga lwaki abo aboogerera ennyo NRM basalawo ne bayingira ekibiina ekyo.
Museveni has been keen to reward everyone when they accept his leadership even when he knows that at heart they disagree with his politics	Museveni awa empeera oyo yenna akkiriza obukulembeze bwe wadde ng'akimanyidde ddala nti tebakkiriziganya na byabufuzi bwe.
Museveni recognises that cooptation of elites is cheaper than fighting	Museveni akimanyi nti okulondamu abagezi kyangu okusinga okubalwanyisa.
He has employed repression of course, but only selectively on those who have sought to challenge him – like Kizza Besigye	Oluusi kino akikozesa okusobola okunyigiriza abo ababa basazeewo okumusoomooza nga bwe kiri ku Besigye
By demonstrating the rewards of loyalty and increasing the costs of opposition on the individuals who try, the president has scared many potential NRM defectors and opponents from attempting resistance to his rule	Ng'ayitira mu kuwa empeera abo abeesigwa gyali, era n'akaluubiriza nnyo abo abali ku ludda oluvuganya gavumenti, pulezidenti atiisizza nnyo abo abandyagadde okuva mu NRM era n'abo abandyagadde okulwanyisa obufuzi bwe.
Museveni’s willingness to embrace potentially hostile politicians has led to what economists call “preference falsification” – people pretending to support NRM even when they actually don’t	"Eky'okuba nti Museveni mwetegefu okwaniriza bannabyabufuzi ababadde bamuwakanya, kituukaganye n'abamu kye bayita ""okusalawo okw'obulimba.""  Abantu beefuula okuba abawagira NRM wadde nga ekituufu kiri nti tebagiwagira."
Politicians in Uganda therefore face a choice of staying loyal to Museveni and hence continue to enjoy power and the privileges that go with it; or to openly challenge him and invite the wrath of the state like Besigye	Bannabyabufuzi mu Uganda boolekaganye n'okusalawo okweyongera okuba abawulize eri Museveni ne beeyongera okuba n'obuyinza era n'enkizo oba okumuwakanya ne bafuna ebizibu nga Besigye.
Why NRM losers don’t join FDCthe Last WordMore critically, Museveni understands that an election is a time to test a politician’s popular standing	Ebigambo ebisembayo bikulu nnyo era biraga ensonga lwaki abo ababa tebayiseemu tabayinza kwesoga mu FDC, Museveni akimanyi nti ekiseera eky'okulonda kigezesa obuganzi munnabyabufuzi bw'aba alina mu bantu.
20 President Yoweri Museveni met about 3,000 supporters of his party, the National Resistance Movement (NRM), from Mawokota North constituency in Mpigi district	Pulesidenti Museveni yasisinkana abawagizi b'ekibiina kye abawera nga enkumi satu abaava e Mawokota North constituency, mu disitulikiti y'e Mpigi.
The meeting was organised by the newly elected queen of the area, Amelia Kyambadde, who is the immediate past principal private secretary to the President	Omumbejja w'ekitundu ekyo Amelia Kyambadde ate nga yaliko omuwandiisi ow'ekyama owa pulezidenti, ye yategeka olukuŋŋaana olwo
The meeting was intended to get the area MP, Peter Claver Mutuluuza, not to contest against Amelia in next year’s general elections	Ekigendererwa ky'olukuŋŋaana olwo kwali okumatiza omubaka wa palamenti ow'ekitundu ekyo Claver Mutuluuza obuteesimba ku Amelia Kyambadde mu kulonda okuddako.
The calm and softspoken Mutuluuza is no stranger to battles with big shots in his party and, he says, defeating Kyambadde in the 2011 parliamentary elections will be easy  even if she has Museveni’s backing	Kyambadde ajja kuba mwangu mu kulonda kw'ababaka ba palaminti mu 2011 ne bw'anaaba ng'awagiddwa Museveni.
According to a statement from State House, Mutuluuza told the President that he deliberately chose to contest as an independent candidate “because of the democracy and right guaranteed under the constitution”	"Okusinziira ku bigambo ebyava mu State House, Mutuluuza yagamba pulezidenti nti yakigenderera okwesimbawo ku lulwe ""olwa demokulasiya n'ebbettu erimuweebwa mu ssemateeka."""
I will have a picture of Mutuluuza and that of the President because I am his supporter	Njakuba n'ekifaananyi kya Mutuluuza era n'ekya pulezidenti kubanga ndi muwagizi we.
I have no problem with Museveni	Museveni simulinako kizibu kyonna.
I want to thank Amelia for the development she has done in Mawokota North	Njagala kwebaza Amelia olw'enkulaakulana gy'aleese e Mawokota North
If I had also been given money I would have done the same,” he said in a veiled swipe at State House sponsorship of Museveni’s blueeyed girl, Amelia	Singa nnaweebwa ssente nnange nnandikoze ekintu kye kimu
“Abantu abamu mu muvumenti basiwuka,” he said in Luganda, meaning: “some people lack manners”	"Yagamba nti ""abantu abamu mu Muvumenti baasiiwuka empisa."""
“They are Movement only in words but not in their actions,” Museveni said in a veiled reference to Mutuluuza	"Ba Muvumenti mu bigambo mwokka naye si mu bikolwa,"" bw'atyo Museveni bwe yayogera ng'ajuliriza ku bigambo bya Mutuluuza."
Museveni reportedly dangled a ministerial appointment for him if he dropped his 2011 bid	Museveni yamusuubiza okumuwa obwa minisita singa teyeesimbawo mu 2011.
That was unusual and appears to have shocked Museveni	Ekyo tekyali kya bulijjo era kirabika kyakanga nnyo Museveni.
The Amelia, Mutuluuza rift is not the only fallout from the recently concluded countrywide NRM primaries and NRM party leadership elections	Enjawukana ebaddewo wakati wa Mutuluuza ne Amelia si ye yokka ebaddewo mu kibiina kya NRM mu kulonda okw'okusunsulibwamu okubadde kwakabaawo mu ggwanga lyonna.
Up to 600 election petitions have been filed with the NRM Electoral Commission and losers have been spewing threats to catch President Museveni’s eye	Emisango egisukka mu lukaaga egyekuusa ku bubbi bw'obululu gyawaabirwa eri akakiiko ka NRM ak'eby'okulonda era abo abaagwa batiitiisa okunaabira pulezidenti Museven mu maaso
Museveni knows that very few of them would reject a ministerial job or any other in the government	Museven akimanyi nti batono nnyo ku abo abandigaanye okulondebwa okuba baminisita oba okuweebwa omulimu omulala gwonna mu gavumenti.
Take Agaba Abbas, the former leader of the NRM youth league, who was beaten to the party’s flagbearer status in Kitagwenda constituency, Kamwenge district	Take Agaba Abbas eyaliko omukulembeze w'abavubuka mu NRM eyawangulibwa mu kalulu k'abo abanaakwatira ekibiina bbendera mu Kitagwenda, mu disitulikiti y'e Kamwenge
He petitioned against the results claiming the incumbent MP and NRM flagbearer, Nulu Byamukama, used massive intimidation and violence in which some of his supporters were even cut with machetes	Yawaaba omusango ogwekuusa ku by'okulonda ng'agamba nti omubaka wa NRM aliko era nga y'akwatidde NRM bbendera, Nulu Byamukama yatiisatiisa nnyo abalonzi era yakozesa ebikolwa eby'obukambwe bingi ekyaviirako abamu ku bawagizi be okufumitibwa ebiso.
He says, however, that he will not stand as an independent because he is sure Museveni will give him a job	Kyokka yagamba nti tajja kwesimbawo ku lulwe kubanga mukakafu nti Museveni ajja kumuwa omulimu
He says Museveni persuaded him to drop out of the race for NRM vice chairperson for Western Uganda.	Yagamba nti Museveni yamukubiriza okuva mu lwokaano alekere omummyuka wa ssentebe wa NRM mu Buggwanjuba bwa Uganda.
Matayo Kyaligonza on assurances that he was to be “deployed elsewhere within the state”	Matayo Kyaligonza yali mukakafu nti ajja kuweebwa omulimu mu kifo kyonna mu ggwanga.
Museveni, whose urgent concern is to hold his supporters together after the acrimonious primaries and hardly five months to the general election, looks increasingly determined to use his prerogative to promise NRM losers to public office jobs	Museveni ng'ekisinga okumubobbya omutwe mu kiseera kino kwe kugatta awamu abawagizi be oluvannyuma lw'okulonda kuno okw'okusunsulamu okutaagenda bulungi ate ng'ebulayo emyezi egitasukka mu ettaano okulonda kwa bonna kubeewo, alabika nga mumalirivu nnyo okukozesa enkola ye ey'okusuubiza abo abaagwa emirimu emirala mu kibiina kya NRM.
NRM cadres that have already been identified should not have to think that the electoral offices are the only offices of service.	Aba NRM abamaze okunokolwayo tebalina kulowooza nti emirimu egy'okulondebwa abalonzi gye gyokka egiriwo.
”Promises for jobs have raised concern during Museveni's campaign.	"""Okusuubiza abantu emirimu kireeseewo obunkenke mu kampeyini za Museveni."
Dr Yasin Olum of Makerere University Political Science department says Uganda’s politics has become transactional, is no longer a service and Museveni will use it to maximum advantage	Dr. Yasin Olum ow'omu Yunivasite y'e Makerere mu kitongole ekisomesa eby'obufuzi agamba nti eby'obufuzi bwa Uganda bifuuse bya busuubuzi, kuno tekukyali kuweereza bantu era kino Museveni ajja kukikozesa nnyo kiganyula ye.
President Museveni will definitely achieve his immediate objective, which is keeping himself in power	Pulezidenti Museveni ajja kutuukiriza ekyo ky'ayagala, nga kino kwe kwenywereza mu buyinza.
”Olum, who is an expert on the democratisation process in Uganda, says the negative effects of the commercialisation of our politics will be borne by future generations	Olumu ate nga ye mukugu ku nsonga ezikwata ku demokulasiya mu Uganda, naye akabi akali mu kufuula eby'obufuzi okuba busineesi abanaabaawo mu biseera eby'omu maaso be bajja okwolekagana nabyo.
The Uganda constitution limits the number of ministers and their deputies to 42 but, in a bid to appease numerous political interests, Museveni has appointed 69 ministers and their deputies, hundreds of RDCs, Presidential Advisors, and other state agents	Ssemateeka wa Uganda akirambika nti baminisita mu Uganda awamu n'abammyuka baabwe balina kubeera 42, naye olw'okuba Museveni ayagala okubaako b'asanyusa mu by'obufuzi, alonze 69 awamu n'abammyuka baabwe, ne ba RDC bangi ddala, abawabuzi ba pulezidenti awamu n'abalala bangi.
For now, because it could jolt the gravy train ahead of the impending elections, Museveni cannot announce many new appointments but the job promises spewing out of State House suggest the legions of statesponsored leaches will increase in 2011	Museveni kino tayinza kukirangirira mu kiseera kino kubanga kiyinza okutabangula embeera naye eby'okusuubiza emirimu ebiva mu State House biraga nti omuwendo gwa baminisita gujja kulinnya nnyo mu 2011.
Critics say this places a huge burden on the national purse but Museveni maintains that it is the price of peace and proponents of the jobsforpeace in the NRM are equally adamant	Abeekenenya  bagamba nti kino kijja kuba muggugu gwa maanyi eri eby'enfuna by'eggwanga, naye ye Museveni agamba nti kino kyetaagisa okusobola okubaawo emirembe era ng'eno ye nkola ya NRM.
NRM Vice Chairman for Eastern Region, Mike Mukula says the strategy will work	Omummyuka wa ssentebe w'ekibiina kya NRM mu buvanjuba bwa Uganda Mike Mukula agamba nti enkola eno ejja kukola bulungi.
A party supporter who spoke out on condition of remaining anonymous says he was rigged out in the NRM elections in 2005 for MP in Mayuge district	Omuwagizi wa NRM atayagadde kwatuukirizibwa mannya agamba nti yabbibwa akalulu mu 2005 nga yeesimbyewo okulondebwa ng'omubaka wa palamenti mu disitulikiti y'e Mayuge.
He says Museveni and Hajji Moses Kigongo, at a meeting at the party headquarters on  Kyaddondo Road in Kampala, convinced him and others not to stand as independents on the understanding that they would work on the regional Museveni Task Force and later get jobs.	Agamba nti bwe baali ku lukuŋŋaana ku kitebbe ekikulu eky'ekibiina e Kyaddondo Road mu Kampala, Museveni ne Hajji Moses Kigongo baamumatiza nti ye n'abalala obuteesimbawo ku lwabwe kubanga baali bagenda kubeera mu abo abanaakulemberamu okunoonya akalulu n'oluvannyuma balifuna emirimu.
He says they held several meetings chaired by Sembabule District Chairperson Herman Sentongo as they toed with the idea of going independent	Agamba nti baabanga n'enkuŋŋaana nnyingi nga zikubirizibwa ssentebe wa disitulikiti y'e Sembabule Herman Sentongo era mu kiseera ekyo baali bamalirivu okwesimbawo ku bwabwe.
Rujumbura County MP and Chairman of NRM Veterans, Jim Muhwezi, says Museveni will deploy some of the losers within the party or the state and “facilitate others to carry out private business”	Omubaka wa palamenti ow'e Rujumbura era nga y'akola nga ssentebe w'abaazirwanako mu NRM, Jim Muhwezi, agamba nti Museveni ajja kuwa emirimu abamu ku abo abaawangulwa, mu kibiina mwenyini oba mu gavumenti, ate abalala abayambe okwekolera busineesi.
”Others, like Mutuluuza, are unlikely to pay attention to Muhwezi’s counsel	Abalala gamba nga Mutuluuza tebayinza kuwuliriza ebyo Muhwezi by'agamba.
Until his party, the NRM, endorsed Amelia, Mutuluuza’s seat was secure	Mutuluuza yali akkalidde mu kifo kye okutuusa ekibiina kye ekya NRM lwe kyaleeta Amelia.
The resident of Kammengo Township along KampalaMasaka highway remains very popular among his ethnic Banyarwanda who are a sizeable voting block in the constituency and has courted the other big voting blocks in his constituency, the Catholics and the Baganda establishment at Mengo	Omutuuze w'e Kammengo ekiri ku luguudo lw'e Masaka alina obuganzi bungi eri Banyarwanda banne abasinga obungi mu kitundu ekyo era ataddewo enkolagana n'abalonzi abalala era nga nabo bangi nnyo mu kitundu ekyo era bano be Bakatoliki n'abaganda abalina enkolagana ey'oku lusegere ne Mengo.
When in 2008-2009 Museveni’s government fought with the Mengo establishment over the acrimonious Land Amendment Bill 2007, Mutuluuza voted with Buganda and ganged up with Buganda legislators to force an emergency recall of parliament from recess to discuss the arrest of three Buganda Kingdom officials who had spoken out against the proposed land amendments	Mu 2008-2009 gavumenti ya Museveni bwe yalwanagana ne gavumenti y'e Mengo ku bikwata ku tteeka ly'ettaka erya 2007, Mutuluuza yali ku ludda lwa Buganda era ye ne bannabyabufuzi okuva mu Buganda bayita palamenti eyali egenze mu luwummula basobole okwogera ku ky'okukwata abakungu abasatu ab'omu Bwakabaka bwa Buganda abaali bavumiridde eky'okukola enoongosereza mu tteeka ly'ettaka.
Kyambadde tried to court ethnic Baganda by promising to engineer the return to air of the closed Buganda Kingdom radio station, CBS	Kyambadde yagezaako okusikiriza Abaganda ng'abasuubiza okuzaako laddiyo y'obwakabaka CBS eyali eggaliddwawo.
She used to move with some of the former workers of CBS, assuring supporters that she is working hard to switch the radio back on air and she is taking care of the interests of the former workers	Yatambulanga n'abamu ku abo abaali abakozi ba CBS ng'akakasa abawagizi be nti akola butaweera okuzzaako laddiyo era afaayo nnyo ku abo abaali abakozi ba laddiyo eyo.
Despite that, President Museveni appears to have anointed Amelia	Wadde nga kyali bwe kityo, kirabika ye Museveni yali yamala dda okulonda Amelia.
Sensing this, Mutuluuza opted to step outside the NRM, not participate in its primaries but run as an independent in 2011	Mutuluuza bwe yategeera ekyo, yasalawo okudda ebbali wa NRM, era teyeenyigira mu kammyufu k'ekibiina naye yeesimbawo ku lulwe mu 2011.
Museveni and Amelia know Mutuluuza could defeat them	Museveni ne Amelia bakimanyi nti Mutuluuza asobola okubawangula.
The Mawokota North MP is no stranger to battles with party big shots	Omubaka wa palamenti ow'e Mawokota atera okuba mu ntalo n'abanene abali mu kibiina.
He wrestled the constituency from an NRM strongman, the late former minister Zimula Mugwanya	Yalwanagana n'omunene omu mu kitundu ekyo, eyali minisita omugenzi Zimula Mugwanya.
In the heat of the acrimonious 2001 campaigns in which Mutuluuza accused Mugwanya of violently attacking his supporters, Mutuluuza is thought to have sponsored a court case in which Mugwanya was eventually thrown out of parliament for lack of academic qualifications	Mu kampeyini eyali enzibu ennyo eya 2001 Mutuluuza alyoke avunaane Mugwanya olw'okulumba abawagizi be mu ngeri ey'obukambwe, kigambibwa nti Mutuluuza yawangula omusango era Mugwanya n'aggyibwa mu palamenti olw'obutaba na buyigirize bumala.
Mugwanya was one of the financiers of the NRM bush war and his entourage on the campaign trail always had military escorts	Mugwanya yali omu ku abo abaawagira ennyo NRM mu by'ensimbi mu lutalo lw'omu nsiko era mu kampyeni ze kwabangako ab'amaggye.
Museveni’s hands tiedAs he weighs his next move, Museveni has been meeting with delegations from different areas where primary elections were chaotic and threatened his support	Emikono gya Museveni gisibiddwa emmabega era alowooza ku kiddako. Museveni abadde asisinkana abantu okuva mu bitundu eby'enjawulo okulonda gye kutagenda bulungi ne kiviirako abawagizi be okutya.
Museveni appears to merely seek opportunities to cajole, caution, and threaten	Kirabika nga Museveni ayagala okufuna akakisa okubalimba, okubakomako, n'okubatiisatiisa.
One such delegation came from Nakaseke district	Abamu ku bantu abo baava Nakaseke.
In Nakaseke, an NRM stronghold, antiriot police are still on patrol, and Finance Minister Syda Bbumba’s home is one of the highly guarded spots	Mu Nakaseke ate nga kye kimu ku bitundu NRM gy'erina obuwagizi obw'amaanyi, poliisi ekkakanya obujagalalo ekyalawuna, era n'amaka ga minisita w'eby'ensimbi Syda Bbumba ge gamu ku ago agasinze okukuumibwa.
The district was gripped in tension when one Nsamba Bukenya was declared winner of the NRM flagbearer contest for the district chair	Disitulikiti yalimu obunkenke bungi Nsamba Bukenya bwe yalangirirwa nga bwe yali omuwanguzi anaakwatira NRM bbendeera mu kifo kya ssentebe wa disitulikiti.
Incumbent chairperson, Ignatius Koomu, is believed to have won the election but the results were allegedly interchanged with those of Bukenya	Kigambibwa nti ssentebe aliko Koomu ye yawangula naye mbu ebyava mu kulonda byawanyisibwamu ne balangirira Bukenya
NRM delegates boo the party General Secretary Amama Mbabazi during the National Conference at Namboole on June 26	Abakiise mu ttabamiruka wa NRM eyali e Namboole mu Jjuuni nga 26 baalonda ssabawandiisi w'ekibiina kya NRM Amama Mbabazi.
Both Vice President Prof. Gilbert Bukenya and Trade Minister Maj. Gen. Kahinda Otafiire, who lost the secretary general post to Security Minister Mbabazi, have shown limited interest in party activities since the acrimonious showdown at Namboole	Bombi omummyuka wa pulezidenti Pro. Gilbert Bukenya ne minisita w'eby'obusuubuzi Maj. Gen. Kahinda Otafiire, abaawangulwa mu kifo kya ssabawandiisi, beesuliddeyo ogwannagamba mu ebyo ebikolebwa mu kibiina okuva okulonda lwe kwagwa e Namboole.
Opponents accuse her of orchestrating a voterigging scheme that turned the results of the primary elections upside down	Abalabe be bamuvunaana nti yenyigira mu kubba obululu era kino ne kiviirako ebyali mu kulonda okwo obutaba bituufu.
The moment Bukenya was declared winner, spontaneous demonstrations broke out in the district	Kasita Bukenya yalangirirwa ku buwanguzi, waaliwo okwekalakasa mu disitulikiti.
Some 1,500 party cards were returned to the party offices in Semuto subcounty by angry supporters who felt their candidate had been robbed of victory	Kaada z'ekibiina eziwera nga 1500 zaakomezebwawo ku ofiisi y'ekibiina e Semuto ng'abawagizi bagamba nti oyo gwe babadde bawagira yabbibwa.
The demonstrators took to digging up the new tarmac road that is being built from Matugga to Butalangwa, the seat of the district administration	Abeekalakaasi baagenda ne batandika okusimmula ekkubo lya kolaasi eppya erizimbibwa okuva e Matugga okudda e Butalangwa awali ekitebe kya disitulikiti.
With the situation out of hand, Museveni invited a team from Nakaseke to explain to him what had happened	Olw'okuba embeera yali eyonoonese nnyo, Museveni alina be yayita okuva e Nakaseke bamubuulire ekyaliwo.
A source that attended the meeting says that Bbumba tilted the composition of the team to include many of her supporters who would misinform the president about the situation on the ground in Nakaseke	Abamu ku abo abaali mu lukuŋŋaana olwo bagamba nti Bumba yakyusa abo abaalina okugenda eri pulezidenti n'assaamu abawagizi be abandigambye Museveni ebitali bituufu ku mbeera eyali e Nakaseke.
“I felt uncomfortable throughout the meeting with the president because what was being fed to him was false but I was afraid to say the truth until Mubeezi, a resident of Ngoma subcounty, spoke out and informed the president that whatever he was being told was wrong,” the source told The Independent	"Mu lukungaana olwo lwonna nnawulira nga siteredde olw'eby'obulimba ebyali bigambibwa pulezidenti naye nnali ntya okwogera amazima okutuusa Mubeezi, omu ku batuuze b'e ggombolola y'e Ngoma lwe yayogera n'agamba pulezidenti nti buli kye baali bamugamba si ge gaali amazima,"" waliwo ensonda ezaagamba The Independenti."
After Mubeezi spoke out, the source added, he got support from a few members of the delegation and the president was put in a dilemma	Ensonda zigamba nti, Mubeezi bwe yamala okwogera, yafuna abamuwagira okuva mu abo abaali bagenze okusisinkana pulezidenti era kino kyasobera nnyo pulezidenti.
“He (Museveni) promised to send a factfinding team to establish the truth of what was going on in Nakaseke,” continued the source	Era ensonga zigattako nti, Museven alina be yasindika e Nakaseke okusobola okuzuula amazima gennyini ku ebyo ebyaliwo.
The factfinding team established that most people in Nakaseke favour Koomu and on the basis of this information, radio announcements were made to the effect that Koomu is the NRM flagbearer for Nakaseke district	Abo be baatuma baakizuula nti abantu b'e Nakaseke baali baagala Koomu era nti okusinziira ku kino, ku ladiyo baalangirira nti Koomu gwe balonze okukwatira NRM bbendera mu disitulikiti y'e Nakaseke.

The results that were entered in the forms and eventually declared at Namboole, Nsereko reportedly informed Museveni, were false	Kigambibwa nti Nsereko yagamba Museveni nti ebyo ebyali ku foomu era oluvannyuma ebyalangirirwa e Namboole, tebyali bituufu.
Namayanja lost the deputy secretary general post to incumbent Dorothy Hyuha while Masinde lost to Katongole Singh in the race for deputy treasurer	Namayanja yawangulwa Dorothy Hyuha mu kifo ky'omummyuka wa ssabawandiisi, ate Masinde n'awangulwa Katongole Singh mu kifo ky'omuwanika.

Nsereko had fought Babu on three different fronts in just a couple of months	Mu myezi ebiri gyokka, Nsereko yali alwanye ne Babu entalo ssatu ez'enjawulo.
Namayanja confirmed that the meeting took place but declined to divulge what was discussed	Namayanja yagamba nti olukungaana lwaliwo naye yagaana okwogera ebyalulimu.
She was referring to the chaos and rigging that marred the Butaleja district primary elections in which Hyuha lost the flag for district woman MP despite being accused of participating in rigging	Yali ayogera ku kavuyo n'okubba obululu ebyali mu kulonda kw'e Butaleja Hyuha amale awangulwe wadde nga yavunaanibwa ogw'okubba obululu.
Her only hope, she said, was in the new entrants on the executive team, especially Amelia Kyambadde (party treasurer), Abdul Nadduli (Vice Chairperson for Buganda region) and Sam Engola (vice chairperson for Northern region), to bring a new dimension	Yagamba nti esuubi lyokka lye yali asigazizza lyali mu bappya abaali bayingiddewo okusingira ddala Amelia Kyambadde (omuwanika w'ekibiina) Abdul Nadduli (omummyuka wa ssentebe mu Buganda) ne Sam Engola (omummyuka wa ssentebe mu Mambuka) nti bano bayinza okuleetawo enkola empya.

If Otafiire and other disgruntled party members choose to keep off party activities and leave it to Mbabazi’s group, as Otafiire’s comment suggests, Museveni would find himself in a complicated position on the campaign trail next year	Bwe kiba nga Otafiire n'abalala bonna abaali abanyiivu baasalawo emirimu okugirekera Mbabazi ne banne nga Otafiire bwe yagamba, Museven yandyesanze mu kiseera ekizibu ennyo mu kampeyini ze omwaka ogujja.

Karango says that her husband’s body was brought home for burial	Karagaro agamba nti omulambo gwa bba gwakomezebwawo ne guziikibwa.
Since 2004, Karango is supposed to have received her late husband’s pension from the government but has failed despite repeated efforts	Karango agamba nti okuva mu 2004 abadde alina okuba ng'afuna ssente za bba eza pensoni okuva mu gavumenti naye wadde ng'afubye nnyo, tazifunanga.
Karango says that her inlaws were against the idea of her pursuing the pension and consequently hid the documents that were required for one to claim the pension	Karango agamba nti ab'engaanda ze baali tebaagala alondoole ssente ezo era ne basalawo bakweke ebiwandiiko ebyali byetaagisibwa omuntu okusobola okufuna ssente ezo.

” However, Felix Kulayigye, the UPDF spokesman recently announced that the Ministry of Defence has already secured the money to clear the pension arrears	"""Kyokka, Felix Kulayigye omwogezi wa UPDF gyebuvuddeko awo yagamba nti Minisitule y'eby'Okwerinda emmaze okufuna ssente ez'okusasula abantu abo."
The audit titled “Pension Processing by the department of Compensation: ministry of Public Service” noted that “the general delays led to failure by retired officers to provide for themselves and their families leading to increased dependency burden, distress and frustration	"Ekiwandiiko ekyaliko omutwe nti, ""Minisitule y'abakozi ekola ku kusasula ssente za pensoni"" kyagamba nti okulwa okwo kuleetedde abajaasi abaawummula okulemererwa okwetuusaako era n'okutuusa ku b'omu maka gaabwe ebyetaago byabwe era kino ne kibaviirako okwesigama ku balala era n'okwenyamira."
Kulaigye says that in total over 140,000 exservice men were registered in the process and that these would benefit from the Shs 34billion that the government earmarked for the exsoldiers	Kulayigye agamba nti abajaasi abasukka mu 140,000 be baawandiisibwa era nga bano bajja kuganyulwa mu ssente obuwumbi 34 gavumenti ze yassaawo okusasula abajaasi bano.

The exercise will also see exsoldiers who served in Amin and Obote II regimes officially discharged from the army	Era mu mbeera y'emu abo abaaliko abajaasi mu kiseera kya Amini ne Obote nabo mu butongole bajja kusiibulwa okuva mu maggye
In March 2009, there were reports that there was a racket in the Directorate of Records, Manpower Audit Section, in which billions meant for the departed soldiers were stolen	Mu mwezi gwa Maaki 2009 kyagambibwa nti waliwo abaali babbye obuwumbi bwa ssente ezo ezaali aza abajaasi.
Emilio Mondo, chief of the Uganda Veterans Board who personally participated in the registration process says that although he cannot say that the ghosts were totally eliminated, he was sure that they were limited and reduced	Emilio Mondo akulira Akakiiko akakola ku abo abaazirwanako era nga ye kennyini yenyigira mu kuwandiika abantu abo agamba nti, wadde nga tayinza kugamba nti abo abaali batalina kufuna ssente ezo baamalibwamu bonna, mukakafu nti bakendezebwa.

But, Byaruhanga told the President, although the government had paid Kemigisa Shs 4.5 billion for land she sold to the government, her lawyer, Bob Kasango, had walked away with all the money	Naye Byaruhanga yagamba pulezidenti nti, wadde nga gavumenti yali esasudde Kemigisa essente obuwumbi buna n'ekitundu ku ttaka lye yaguza gavumenti, munnamateeka we Bob Kasango ssente zonna yali azitute.

When The Independent contacted Kayihura, he confirmed that the President never instructed him to arrest Kasango	Independenti bwe yabuuza Kayihura, yakikakasa nti pulezidenti tamulagirangako kukwata Kasango
Instead, said he had received a call from the queen mother claiming that the President had instructed him to arrest him	Kyokka agamba nti yafuna essimu okuva eri Kwiini ng'agamba nti Pulezidenti amulagidde akwatibwe
According to Kayihura, he directed the arrest of Kasango after both the queen mother and her lawyers told him the President had ordered the arrest	Okusinziira ku Kayihura, ye yalagira Kasango akwatibwe oluvannyuma nga Kwiini awamu ne bannamateeka be bamugambye nti Pulezidenti alagidde nti Kasango akwatibwe

“We believed the queen mother,” Kasirye says, “and if it is true that Kasango paid her, then she lied to us and that was wrong and unfair of her to us and to Kasango	"Tukkiriza nti Kwiini by'atugamba bituufu,"" bw'atyo Kasirye bw'agamba, ""era bwe kiba nti Kasango yamusasula, awo aba atulimbye era aba akoze ekintu ekikyamu gye tuli n'eri Kasango"

Andrew Mwenda nga y'akulira olupapula lwa Independenti, era nga alina oluganda ku Kemigisa era nga ne Kasango akolagana naye mu bizineesi, bwe yakyalira Kemigisa, Kwiini yamugamba nti Kasango yamuwaako ku ssente eziwera obukadde nga bina zokka ku ssente ezaasooka.
To that Kasango said, “Yes it is true some mutual friends have attempted to mediate in the matter and said to me that William is ready to apologize if the queen mother lied to them	"Awo Kasango n'agamba nti, ""Kituufu abamu ku mikwano gyange bagezezaako okuyingira mu nsonga eno era ne bagamba nti William mwetegefu okwetonda bwe kiba nti Kwiini yalimba."
Kasango, who spoke very emotionally, said: Byaruhanga said of me, words laced with acid and bitter lies, nothing he does can take that back	Kasango eyayogera nga munnakuwavu yagamba nti: Byaruhanga yanjogerera ebigambo ebiruma ennyo era tewali ky'ayinza kukola ekiyinza okubiggyawo

Kizza Besigye and other opposition politicians oppose the proposed Public Order Bill.	Kizza Besigye awamu ne bannabyabufuzi abalala abali ku ludda oluvuganya gavumenti bawakanya ebbaggo ly'etteeka erikugira abantu okukungaana
Observers speculate that the Bill could be targeting to control Kabaka’s gatherings which usually carry political overtones whenever he tours the kingdom	Abeekennenya ebigenda mu maaso bagamba nti ekigendererwa ky'etteeka lino kulemesa enkungaana za Kabaka ezitera okubaamu eby'obufuzi
He cited the closure of CBS, denying him access to some territories under his kingdom, arrest of his ministers in 2007 and dividing Buganda into chiefdoms	Yajuliza okuggalwawo kwa CBS, okumulemesa okugenda mu bitundu ebimu eby'obwakabaka, okusiba abamu ku baminisita be mu 2007, n'okwawulayawulamu Buganda
The Kabaka’s remarks were interpreted to be a reference to September riots when he was blocked from going to Kayunga, a district in his kingdom	Ebyo Kabaka bye yayogera byatwalibwa okuba nti yali ayogera ku kwekalakasa okwaliwo mu Ssebutemba bwe yagaanibwa okugenda e Kayunga
He said Buganda will not waver on demanding what rightly belongs to it	Yagamba nti Buganda tejja kulekera awo kusaba ebyayo
Secondly, Buganda has been divided, and many of its properties haven’t been returned	Ekyokubiri, Buganda ekuttuddwakuttuddwamu era nga tennaba kuddizibwa bintu byayo
Thirdly, it is very disappointing that there are places in Buganda where it is said the Kabaka of Buganda must seek permission before visiting his people there,” the Kabaka said in his speech	Ekyokusatu, waliwo ebifo ebimu mu Buganda gye kigambibwa nti Kabaka alina okusooka okufuna olukusa okusobola okugendayo okukyalira abantu be, bw'atyo Kabaka bwe yagamba mu kwogera kwe

According to NMS public relations officer Hamis Kaheru, the drug stock outs occur because cancer medicines are not easy to acquire because the supplier starts the manufacturing process only after the customer has ordered them	Okusinziira ku mwogezi w'ekibiina kino NMS Hamis Kaheru, agamba nti ebbula ly'eddagala libaawo kubanga eddagala erijjanjaba kookolo si lyangu kufuna kubanga abo abalituguza batandika okulikola nga tulisabye

Among other tasks, he was assigned by Jamil Mukulu to distribute tapes laden with jihad ideology and he got 42 tapes from Kampala but due to security clampdown on him, he was not able to distribute them but passed them on to one Hatwib Jowali to distribute as he went on flight to the Buvuma Islands	Ku mirimu Jamil Mukulu gye yamuwa okukola mwe mwali okubunyisa obutambi obuliko ebikwata ku butujju era yaweebwa obutambi 42 okuva e Kampala naye olw'okuba ab'eby'okwerinda baali bamulinya kagere, teyasobola kubugaba naye n'abuwa Hatwib

Other senior members of government have also said publicly that Uganda is looking to Tullow to help collect tax from Heritage	Abakungu abalala nabo bagamba anti gavumenti eyagala Tullow okugiyamba okusoloza omusolo okuva ku kampuni ya Heritage
The company made a mistake in buying from Heritage while the tax issue remained unresolved, according Tullow has operations across three exploration blocks in southwestern Uganda	Kampuni yakola ensobi okugula ku Heritage ng'ensonga y'emisolo tennaba kugonjolebwa, Tullow erina by'ekola ku nzizza za mirundi esatu eziri mu bukiikakkono bwa Uganda

Perhaps his analysis of the PSAs has revealed another factor that weakens Uganda’s argument	Oboolyawo engeri gy'annyonnyolamu PSA etuyamba okutegeera ensonga endala ennafuya Uganda gy'erina

Over and again, the UPDF is accused of potential war crimes not solely during the Second Congo War, but during the First Congo War between July 1996 and July 1998, and the transition period of January 2001 to June 2003	Emirundi n'emirundi UPDF evunaaniddwa okuzza emisango egyekuusa ku ntalo mu kiseera ky'olutalo lw'e Congo olwasooka ne mu lw'okubiri ezaaliwo mu 1996 ne 1998 era n'eggyo gye yazza mu Jjanwali 2001 okutuuka mu Jjuuni 2003
He writes that the report accuses the UPDF of crimes in areas where it had not even been deployed	Yawandiika nti alipoota erumika UPDF okuzza emisango mu bitundu gy'etaali
Although UPDF crimes are far more pronounced in the report, the report is hardly “silent” on these other guilty groups	Wadde ng'emisango gya UPDF gino girabika nga gya maanyi nnyo, naye alipoota eyogera ne ku bibiina ebirala
