Iced fish was once seen as a poor food	A na-ahụbu azụ friji dịka nri ndị ogbenye
More than thirty years ago, iced fish were used to cook in poor homes, schools or when there was no money, while beef or chicken were for the rich.

At that time, iced fish were labeled with bad names such as 'Dead Fish'. People stopped buying and eating it.

murder	Igbu mmadụ
Anyone that commits murder will bear the consequences	Onye ọbụla gburu mmadụ ga-eji isi ya buru njọ a
The land forbids human blood	Ala na-asọ ọbara mmadụ.
Nnabuihe explained that the Igbos believed that land is a life giver	Nnabuihe kọwara n'Igbo nwere nkwenye na Ala bụ nne na-enye ndụ.
That is why it becomes law that nobody kills another, for the person will not be able to give life	Ya mere ka ọ bụrụ iwu na ọ nweghi onye ga-egbu mmadụ makana onye ahụ agaghị enwe ike inye ndụ.
The punishment for anybody who commits murder is to banish the person from the land or send the person to the evil forest where he/she will die	Ntaramahụhụ onye ọbụla gburu mmadụ bụ ịchụpụ onye ahụ n'ala ahụ maọbụ ịkpọrọ onyeahụ gawa ajọ ọhịa ebe ọ ga-anwụ.

Before they take the person's corpse to the evil forest, the native doctors will offer many sacrifices to wipe out any disaster which it could bring to the people	Tupu ha buru ozu onye ahụ gawa n'ime ajọ ọhịa, ndị dibia ga-achụ aja di icheiche iji sachapụ ajọ ihe ụdị ihe a nwere ike ibute n'ala ahụ.
it is after this ceremony that the youths will carry the person's corpse to the evil forest	Ọ bụ mgbe e mechara emume a ka ndị ntorobịa ga-eburu ozu onye ahụ gawa ajọ ọhịa.
sleeping with a member of your family	Idina onye si ezinaụlọ gị
this is what the land forbids and also an abomination in Igbo land	Ihe a bụkwa ihe Ala na-ajụ bụrụkwa nnukwu arụ n'ala Igbo.
If a child is born through this act, the villagers will carry him to the evil forest and banish the family of the child from the land	Ọ bụrụ na nwa pụta na mmekọ a, ndị obodo ahụ ga-eburu ya gawa n'ime ajọ ọhịa ma chụpụkwa ezinaụlọ nwa ahụ n'ala ahụ.
Igbo believes that land has cursed that family	Igbo nwere nkwenye na Ala abụọla ezinaụlọ ahụ ọnụ.
sleeping with animals	Idina anụmanụ
This animal contacts disease	Arụ a na-ebute ọrịa

But whenever it happens, Igbo believes that the land will transmit disease to the person	Mana mgbe ọbụla o mere, Igbo nwere nkwenye na Ala ga-ebunye onye ahụ ọrịa.
This disease could be madness, leprosy, stomach upset or dropsy and other things	Ọrịa a nwere ike ịbụ ara, ekpenta (Leprosy), afọ ọsịsa maọbụ nzịza (Dropsy) na ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ.
The people will hurriedly take the person to the evil forest where he will die	Obodo ahụ ga-eji ngwa ngwa buru onye ahụ gawa ajọ ọhịa ebe ọ ga-anwụ.
giving birth to twins	Ịmụ ejima
Christianity has made Igbos stopped many of these laws	Ụka Krist emeela ka Igbo kwụsị ọtụtụ iwu a
This is heartbreaking but the cause is not known	Nke a na-agbawa obi mana ọ bụ amaghị ihe butere ya.
Igbo believes in the olden days that the land is a life giving spirit, also gives child, gives a couple only one baby at a time	Igbo nwere nkwenye n'oge gboo na Ala bụ mmụọ na-enye ndụ na-enyekwa nwa na-enye di na nwunye sọọsọ otu nwa n'otu ugboro.
The believe that any woman who give birth to twins, has a sexual affair with another man who is not her husband	Ha nwere nkwenye na nwaanyị ọbụla mụrụ ejima nwere mmekọrịta n'aka nwoke nke abụghị di ya.

How does your New Partner Programme works?.	Kedụ ka atụmatụ ịrụkọ ọrụ ọnụ ọhụrụ gị si arụ ọrụ? 
It is very simple, normally if I refer you to a broker, there is what we call spread, which is the difference between buying and selling price.	Ọ dị ezigbo mfe, ka o si kwesi ọ bụrụ na m zigara gị ọre ahịa, onwere ihe anyị na-akpọ 'spread', nke bụ ndị iche dị n' etiti ọnụ igo ahịa na ọnụ ire ahịa.
That is where brokers make their money.	Ebe ahụ ka ndị ọre ahịa si enweta ego ha.
They share about 50 per cent of that trading initially and we call them partners.	Ha na-eke ihe dị ka pe senti 50 nke mbido ịzụ ahịa ma anyị na-akpọ ha ndị nrụkọọrụọnụ.
What if I refer you and you now become a partner and you refer somebody else and that person becomes a partner, who also referred someone?	Kedụ maka ọ bụrụ na m ziga gị, I wee bụrụ onye nrụkọọrụọnụ, I ziga onye ọzọ, onye ahụ bụrụ onye nrụkọọrụọnụ, onye zigakwara onye ọzọ?
Shouldn't you be making money in referring somebody?	Ọ bụ n' ị gaghị na-enweta ego maka iziga mmadụ?
That is the new system that we have created, like higher level of stream of income for a partner, making it a multi-layer, instead of just a single layer system.	Nke ahụ bụ usoro ọhụrụ anyị meputarala, dị ka ogo dị elu nke ego si abatara onye nrụkọọrụọnụ, na-eme ya imerime okpukpu, kama nanị usoro otu okpukpu.
How reliable is the technology behind this business plan?.	Kedụ ụdị ntụkwasị obi teknọlọjị atụmatụ azụmahịa gbadoro ụkwụ dị?
Technology is not new.	Teknọlọjị abụghị ihe ọhụrụ.
At least, I have been in the business between seven and eight years and it has been around that same time.	Ọ pekata mpe, anọla m n' azụmahịa a agbata afọ asaa na asatọ mana ọ nọrọla ya oge ahụ.
I don't think there has ever been any day that the whole market is down and nothing is working.	Echeghi m na enwela ụbọchị ahịa niile mechiri ma onweghi ihe na-arụ ọrụ.
That has never happened.	Nke ahụ emenubeghi.
For example, about 60 per cent of the whole American economy is in New York Stock Exchange, which is why companies like Ali Baba in China can leave the country to raise money in America because there's no other place you can get that kind of money.	Ọmụma atụ, ihe dị ka pe senti 60 akụnụba Amerịka niile dị na 'New York Stock Exchange', nke mere n' ụlọ ọrụ dị ka Ali Baba na China nwere ike ịhapụ obodo ahụ ịnakọ ego n' Amerịka makana e nweghị ebe ọzọ I nwere ike inweta ụdị ego ahụ.

If it is not reliable, they won't put all their lives in it.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ dịghị ntụkwasị obi, ha agaghị etinye ndụ ha niile na ya
When people tell me that the likes of 'Wonder Banks' and MMM had gone under, wondering if the forex market will not go like them, I only tell them that they are looking at it locally.

Forex market is not a Nigerian thing, it's not an American thing, it is not a Japanese thing, it is the whole world and driven by a level of fundamentals.	Forex market abụghị ihe Naijiria, ọ bụghị ihe Amerịka, ọ bụghị Japan, ọ bụ ụwa niile ma nwe ogo ntọala na-achị ya.
So, it can go down unless human beings are all going down.	Ya bụ, ọ ga-ada beeresọ ma mmadụ niile a na-ada ada.
What competitive advantage is Rally Trade coming with?.	Kedụ uru asọmpi 'Rally Trade' ji abịa?
To be frank, all brokers offer the same thing.	N' ikwu eziokwu, ọre ahịa niile na-enye otu ụdị ihe.
It's like all Nigerian stockbrokers offer the same thing.	Ọ di ka ndị ọre ahịa Naijiria niile na-enye otu ụdị ihe. 
You want to buy First Bank or GTBank shares, they are all offering the same thing.	Ị chọrọ igote òkè First Bank ma ọ bụ GTBank, ha niile na-enye otu ụdị ihe.
But the things that can make you different are in-depth customer service, things that sometimes, as a stockbroker, you take more time to research on.	Mana ihe ndị ga-eme gị ka ị dị iche bụ ọrụ onye ahịa miri emi, ihe ndị bụ mgbe ụfọdụ, dị ka ọre ahịa, i wepụta oge ịchọcha maka ya. 
Of course, you can advise your clients on how to buy shares.	N' ezie, i nwere ike inye onye ahịa ndụmọdụ ka ọ ga-esi gote òkè.
But if people can see that your clients are making more money, it becomes extra advantage.	Mana ọ bụrụ na ndị mmadụ ahụ na ndị ahịa gị na-enweta ego karịa, ọ na-abụ uru.
In Rally Trade for instance, we have unusual customer support.	Na Rally Trade iji maa atụ, anyị nwere nkwado onye ahịa dị ukwuu.
Our staff call clients every day to know if there is any problem or challenge.	Ndị ọrụ anyị na-akpọ ndị ahịa kwa ụbọchị ịma ma enwere nsogbu ọ bụla ma ọ bụ ihe akamgba.
Every client has a dedicated staff that takes care of his or her business.	Onye ahịa ọ bụla nwere onye ọrụ wepụtara onwe ya maka ileta azụmahịa ya.
Then we have the best education system here.	Nke ọzọ anyị nwere usoro agụmakwụkwọ kasị mma ebe a.
There is no company that is educating Nigerians like Rally academy does.	Enweghi ụlọ ọrụ na-akụziri ndị Naịjirịa ka 'Rally academy' si eme. 
In terms of our conferences, expos, seminars and the trainings we do in our office frequently.	Gbasara ọgbakọ, ngosi, nzukọ ọmụmụ na ọmụmụ anyị na-enwe n' ụlọ ọrụ anyị ugboro ugboro.
So, those are some of the two major advantages that we have- essential customer service and quality education system.	Ya bụ, ha bụ isi uru abụọ nke anyị nwere-----enyemaka onye ahịa dị oké mkpa na usoro agụmakwụkwọ dị mma.
There is this fear about Fintech, especially that of trust.	Enwere egwu dị banyere Fintech, ọ kasị nke ntụkwasị obi.
What is your take?.	Kedụ uche gị?
All a company can do is to make sure that it is dealing with a regulated institution, the same way we are sure that banks are regulated by Central Bank of Nigeria.	Ihe ụlọ ọrụ nwere ike ime bụ ihụ na ya na ewumewu nwere usoro na-emekọ, dị ka ọ si doo anyị anya na 'Central Bank of Nigeria' nyere ụlọ akụ usoro.
We are regulated in Europe by financial commission.	'Financial Commission' nyere anyị usoro na Europe.
At the same time, when I talk to people about online business, if you decide to run away and hide yourself in the sand, saying you don't trust it, your money might disappear, you will never do anything.	N' otu aka ahụ, mgbe m na- agwa ndị mmadụ okwu banyere azụmahịa 'online', ọ bụrụ n' ịchọ ịgbapụ ma zoo onwe gị n' àjà, na-asị na ịtụkwasịghi ya obi, ego gị nwere ike ifu, ị gaghị eme ihe ọbụla.
You won't believe that some people don't use ATM till today, you know why, saying if they are being caught up in a corner, all their money will be collected.	Ị gaghị ekwe na ụfọdụ mmadụ ejighi ATM eme ihe taa, ị mara ihe kpatara ya, na-ekwu na ọ bụrụ n' e jide ha n' akụkụ, a ga-ewere ego ha niile.
Some people don't use Internet banking but that doesn't help you at all.	Ụfọdụ mmadụ enweghị 'Internet banking' mana nke ahụ anaghị enyere gị aka ma ncha.
You are losing more than you are gaining.	I na-etufu karịa ka ị na-erita.
That is the way it is.	Otu ahụ ka ọ dị.
With the current technology comes challenges and hacking of funds, but yet, there is nothing you can do about it other than find how to use them safely and make sure you do enough research.	Ihe iche aka mgba na mbanye anataghị ikike so teknọlọjị ugbua bịa, mana, enweghị ihe I ga-eme banyere ya karịa ịchọ ụzọ ị ga-eji were ha mee ihe n' enweghi nsogbu ma hụ na i mere nchọcha zuru okè.
Wherever you are putting your money, do extensive research.	Ebe ọbụla ị na-etinye ego gị, mee nchọcha miri emi.
For instance, in the last 10 years, Nigerians have gone through several scams.	Ọmụma atụ, n' ime afọ iri gara aga, ndị Naijiria agaferela ọtụtụ ojoro.
We had MMM, Wonder Banks, among others, but I have never lost one kobo to any of them because I learnt about 10 years ago that there are no free money and I had been a victim online, when I lost like $200 and had to withdraw.	Anyị nwere MMM, Wonder Banks, na ndị ọzọ, mana etufubeghi m otu kobo nyere nke ọbụla makana a mụtara ihe dị ka afọ iri gara aga na enweghi ego efu nakwa na abụrụla m onye o metụtara n' 'online', mgbe m tụfuru ihe dị ka $200 nke mere m jiri laa azụ.
So, when Wonder Bank and MMM came, I knew that it was just scam.	Ya bụ, mgbe Wonder Bank na MMM bịara, amara m na ọ bụ nanị ojoro.
People need to be educated, do research, then you really have very little issues when it comes to doing financial business online.	Ndị mmadụ kwesiri ịmụta ihe, mee nchọcha, n' ezie I ga-enwe obere nsogbu ebe ọ gbasara azụmahịa ego n' 'online'
What is the MT4 Platform all about?.	Kedụ ihe MT4 bụ maka ya?
Let me try to describe the MT4 in a simple way.	Ka gbalịa ịkọwa MT4 n' ụzọ dị mfe.
Let's use car, which is the best way.	Ka anyị were ụgbọ ala, nke bu ụzọ kasị mma.
A Toyota and a Honda, what is the difference? Nothing! They both are cars.	Otu Toyota na otu Honda, gịnị bụ ndị iche? Onweghi! Ha abụọ bụ ụgbọala.
But in Nigeria, we have more Toyota than Honda, why? People just love Toyota! Or maybe Toyota is easier to maintain or it has more second hand value or it is cheaper to buy.	Mana na Naijiria, anyị nwere Toyota karịa Honda, maka gịnị? Naanị na ndị mmadụ hụrụ Toyota n' anya! Ma ọ bụ onwere ike o bụrụ na Toyota ka mfe ilekwa anya ma ọbụ n' ọ ka nwee uru na ngokpo ma ọ bụ n' ọ dị ọnụ ala igote.
The same way we have different trading platforms.	Otu ahụ kwa ka anyị si nwe ụzọ izu ahịa dị iche iche.
For instance, there is a company called Tesla, which makes car in the U.S.	Ọmụma atụ, ọnwere ụlọ ọrụ a na-akpọ Tesla, nke na-arụpụta ụgbọ ala n' U. S.
He added that immense opportunities abound in the sector that had remained largely untapped. 'This is why most advanced economies of the world have highly developed their maritime industries'.	Ọ gbakwunyere na nnukwu ohere jupụtara na ngalaba a kpabeghi aka. 'Nke a mere mba ụwa akụnụba ha mepere emepe ji enwe ụlọ ọrụ mmiri mepere emepe nke ukwuu.'
They didn't exist before now.	Ha adịghị na mbụ.
The same way companies create trading platforms for themselves.	Otu ahụ ka ụlọ ọrụ si echeputara onwe ha ụzọ ịzụ ahịa.
So, I can start a brokerage company and decide that like the software banks use, I don't want to use a certain platform, but a fresh one people can trade on that can be better, but that doesn't mean people are going to love it.	Ya bụ, enwere m ike ibido ụlọ ọrụ ire ahịa ma kpebie na di ka 'software banks', agaghị m achọ iji ụfọdụ ụzọ, kama ụzọ ọhụrụ ndị mmadụ nwere ike ịzụ ahịa na ya ka mma, mana ọ pụtaghị na ọ ga-amasị ndị mmadụ.
Tesla is in America now but doesn't mean it is selling more than Toyota that has been selling for a while.	Tesla dị n' Amerịka ugbua mana ọ pụtaghị na ọ na-ere ahịa karịa Toyota no na-ere ahịa nwa oge.
MT4 is just a platform people trade on, just to buy and sell, that is what it is but it is the oldest, it has the highest adoption, it is what people love the most, so every broker has it.	MT4 bụ naanị ụzọ ndị mmadụ si ere ahịa, naanị ịzụ na ire, ya bụ ihe ọ bu mana ọ bụ ụzọ kasị ochie, ọ nwere nhọrọ kasị ukwuu, ọ bụ ihe masịrị ndị mmadụ, ya mere na ọre ahịa ọ bụla nwere ya.

This Chief Danfo driver owns no vehicle.	Onyeisi ọkwọ ụgbọala Danfo a enweghị ụgbọala.

He knows that he is poor.	Ọ mara na ọ bụ ogbenye.

But at least for now, he is contented in the knowledge that he does not have it all.	Mana ugbua, ọ nwere afọ ojuju n' ọmụma na ya enwghi ha ncha.

However, despite these provisions and blessings, the woman is not happy.	Otu ọ dị, n' agbanyeghi ndokwa na ngọzi niile a, obi anaghị atọ nwaanyị ụtọ.
She cries every night because she has not been blessed with the fruit of the womb.	Ọ na-ebe ákwá abalị ọbụla makana e jibeghi mkpụrụ nke afọ wee gọzie ya.

As fate would have it, he is a classmate to one of the children of the 'big men' in town.	Dị ka akara aka si dee ya, ọ bụ nwa klas otu nwa n' ime ụmụ ndị ọgaranya n' obodo.
While the child of the poor driver comes to school barefooted and in completely worn out school uniform, his classmate is brought to school every morning by a chauffeur-driven car.

The boy's food basket is usually the most sought after one during the break time.	Nkata nri nwata nwoke a ka a kasị achọ oge ezumike.
The irony however is this- each time the school closes for the session, the son of the poor driver always takes the first position while his classmate, the child of the rich man, takes the last position.

There's a lot of talk about toilets lately.	E nwere ọtụtụ okwu banyere ụlọ mposi n' ikpeazụ a.
After the Obama administration told US schools to let transgender pupils use toilets matching their gender identity, everyone has an opinion about who should use which toilet.

Meanwhile in the interest of public service, I'd also like to encourage a debate about 'how' toilets are used.	Ugbua n' ihi ọdịmma nke ọrụ ọha, m ga-achọkwa ịkwado arụmụka maka ojiji ụlọ mposi.
I encourage male readers to pay particular attention because I'm asking you to stop peeing on rather than in the toilet.	Ana m agba ndị ụmụ nwoke na-agụ ihe ka tinye uche pụrụ iche makana ana m agwa ha ka ha kwụsị ịnyụ mamịrị n' elu kama n' ime ụlọ mposi.
Were an alien species to conduct an in-depth study of the human species, they would say of Nigerian men – a well-adapted group, intellectually vigorous, entrepreneurial and charming, but with disgraceful toilet manners.

Of course there would be exceptions and some women would be similarly judged.	N' ezie e nwere ndị iche mana a ga-ekpe ụfọdụ ụmụ nwaanyị ikpe.
But the good number of male 'splashers' amidst us would bring the score down.	Mana ọtụtụ ụmụ nwoke n' ime anyị g-ebutu ọnụ ọgụgụ ahụ.
Since aliens may not land on earth in my lifetime, I conducted my own in-depth study about this corrosive issue.	Kemgbe ndị ọbịa enweghi ike ịbịa n' ụwa na ndụ m, emere m nchọcha nke m banyere okwu a.
The study did not (thankfully) involve visits to the Gents.	Nchọcha a (n' inye ekele) agụnyeghi nleta ụlọ mposi.
Rather it was undertaken (reluctantly) in the one given place where all genders share toilets, namely on airplanes.	Kama e mere (n' ejighị obi) n' otu ebe okike niile na-ejekete mposi, ya bụ ụgbọelu.
The study confirmed that using the shared toilets on flights to and from Nigeria is an extraordinarily unpleasant experience.	Nchọcha a gosiri na ijeko mposi n' ụgbọelu site Naijiria nakwa ịlaghachi Naijiria bụ ahụmihe adịghị ụtọ dị egwu.

Jokes aside, toilet use is in truth a political issue.	Egwuregwu laa azụ, ojiji ụlọ mposi bụ n' ezie okwu ndọrọndọrọ ọchịchị.

Though judging by the lines, 'Long time ago African man no dey carry shit, we dey shit inside big big hole, na European man teach us to carry shit', Fela may have disagreed with me on toilet matters.	N' ezie e sowe ụgbara egwu ndị a: 'Ọtụtụ oge gara aga nwoke Afrịka anaghị ebu nsị, anyị na-anyụ nsị n' ime nnukwu ọhere, ọ bụ nwoke Europe kụziri anyị ibu nsị,' Fela nwere ike ghara ikwenyere m banyere okwu mposi.
Because in a sense, I am indeed advocating for western toilet habits.	Makana n' otu ụzọ, ana m akwado àgwà mposi ọdịda anyanwụ.
(By the way, I never imagined I would combine those last three words.).	(Ka o sila dị, echeghi m na m ga-agwọkọta okwu ikpeazụ atọ ahụ ọnụ.). 
Moghalu, then, said that developing a policy framework to include strategic objectives, policy action and strategic plan for implementation to precede reforming the transport sector.

To be clear, had we modernized the old African way of using the toilet to contemporary society it would be better suited both for the environment and for our bodies.	Ka ọ doo anya, ọ bụrụ n' anyị gbanwee ụzọ ojiji mposi Afrịka ochie ka ọ bụrụ ụzọ nke ugbua ọ ga-aka mma nyere gburugburu anyị na ahụ anyị.

Toilet use is not only a political matter, but also a 'geopolitical' one.	Ojiji mposi abụghị nanị okwu ndọrọndọrọ ọchịchị, kama ọ bụkwa nke mpaghara.
I hate to admit it, but I find myself making toilet habit comparisons between countries.	Akpọrọ m ikweta na ya asị, mana enwetara m onwe m n' ime ntule àgwà mposi n' etiti mba na mba.

Tottenham Hotspur's South Korean striker Son Heung-Min (L) and Tottenham Hotspur's Belgian defender Toby Alderweireld (R) celebrate on the pitch after the English Premier League football match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur at the Molineux stadium in Wolverhampton, central England on December 15, 2019.

We get lots of support from government institutions but there is still a huge opportunity for public and private sector financial institutions to increase the access to cheap and collateral-free borrowing, in order to provide a major boost to the industry, and the economy at large.

Celebrating its 125 years of research and impacts, the Natural Resources Institute (NRI), University of Greenwich, has acknowledged the positive impacts of a homegrown technological device developed in Nigeria on value chain development of the root and tuber crops in Africa.

The institute admits that smallholder farmers have benefited and would continue to improve their means of livelihood with the use of value-adding devices in the post-harvest management of their roots and tubers.

The project that propped up the improvement of the design by Nobex Technologies was an initiative of Cassava: Adding Value for Africa (CAVA), facilitated by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and executed through multiple partnership.

To ensure a smooth flow of roots from farm to product, CAVA2 works with SMEs to expand and develop processing capacity; a key issue is the availability of quality equipment and after sales service.

The improvement to the flash dryer, which dries agricultural products almost instantaneously, was started in 2006 when the fabricator was first contacted by specialists from the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), led by the Country Manager of CAVA Nigeria, Professor Lateef Sanni, and a food processing specialist from NRI, Dr Andrew Graffham, from the Natural Resources Institute (NRI), University of Greenwich, the United Kingdom.

Improvements included reduced fuel usage from 374 to 65 litres per tonne of dried product; increased output from approximately 100kg an hour to around 330kg an hour of dried product; and increased efficiency, from 11 to 55 percent.

'The United Nations SDG 3 envisions that by 2030 all countries should ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages.'There are about 13 specific targets to meet.

From all indications, Nigeria is set to miss the targets and the SDG on health except some dramatic and systematic reforms are initiated and sustained from now until 2030,' he said.

Government's expenditure on health (like other sectors) needs to be ratcheted up and its facilitation and regulatory functions strengthened, he said, adding that serious attention at fora like that, should also focus on maximising the latent potential of the 'other hand' (individuals and non-state actors) in reversing what LAPO identifies as the 'progressive decline' of healthcare delivery in Nigeria.	Gọọmenti kwesiri iwelite aka n' ego ọ na-emefu n' ahụ ike (dị ka ngalaba ndị ọzọ) ma mekwuazi ka nkwalite na ọrụ igbazi ya siwanye ike.

The former governorship aspirant in Anambra State identified a strong correlation between poverty/inequality and health.He explained that the 1999 Constitution (as amended) provided for free and compulsory primary education, as well as free secondary education.

In his opening remarks, chairman, LAPO Board of Directors, Dr. Osarenren Emokpae, called on the federal and state governments to increase budgetary allocation for the health sector.He said the increment would help reduce medical tourism, as some of the elite would begin to patronise local health facilities rather than go abroad.

In 2018, Nigeria was ranked 187 out of 191 countries in the world that are not complying with the Universal Health Coverage (UCH), he noted, adding that LAPO, in its inclusive services to its clients and the general public, made healthcare a very important component of its services.The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of LAPO, Godwin Ehigiamusoe, said the country's health sector required urgent and collective attention and action, adding that the healthcare statistics in some cases were very depressing.

What Onitsha fire tells us about the petrol tankers from hell [Pulse Opinion]	Ihe ọkụ Ọnịcha gwara anyị banyere tanka petrolu si ọkụ mmụọ [echiche 'Pulse']
The Onitsha fire accident was totally avoidable. Yet again, Nigeria has killed citizens whose only crime was hustling in a country that never got their backs.	Ọkụ mberede Ọnịcha dị mgbochi kpamkpam. Mana ọzọkwa, Nigeria egbuola ụmụ amadị ndị sọ ihe ọjọọ ha mere bụ na ha na-agba mbọ n' ala na enweghi nchekwa nyere ha.
Onitsha, the Anambra state capital, is mourning. And all of Nigeria with it.	Ọnịcha, isi obodo Anambra, na-eri ụjụ. Nigeria niile sonyere ya.
On Wednesday, October 16, 2019, a petrol laden tanker rammed into buildings in an Onitsha market, spilled its contents in the neigborhood and sparked a fire that ravaged buildings, consumed goods worth millions of Naira and ended lives.	N' ụbọchị Wenzidee, Ọktoba 16, 2019, tanka petrolu juru suru ụlọ n' ahịa Ọnịcha, kwafuo ihe ọ bu na gburugburu ahụ ma nwuru ọkụ mebiri ọtụtụ ụlọ, gbarie ngwa ahịa ruru ọtụtụ nde naịra ma bibie ọtụtụ ndụ.
Onitsha was a ball of fire for hours and no one lifted a finger. The city is still counting its losses.	Ọnịcha bụ sọ ogidi ọkụ ọtụtụ awa ma ọ nweghi onye welitere aka. Obodo a ka na-agụkọ ihe o tụfuru.
The casualty figures from the incident are still hazy at the time of writing, but it has been confirmed that a mother and her child were among the dead; 	Ọnụ Ọgụgụ ndị ihe a metụtara edochaghị anya n' oge a na-ede ihe a, mana o doola anya na nne na nwa ya so na ndị nwụrụ anwụ;
With the fire searing through their skins and leaving them locked in each other's arms until the very end.	Ọkụ gbara ha agba agba n' ahụ, ebe ọkụ kpọchiri ha n' ogwe aka onwe ha ruo n' ọnwụ.
The fire incident in Onitsha yesterday is sad and regrettable. I am profoundly touched by the sight of the charred remains of an innocent mother and her child, who are victims of this tragedy,' said President Muhammadu Buhari.	'Ọkụ gbara n' Ọnịcha ụnyaahụ dị mwute. Ozu nne na nwa ọkụ gbapịrị n' enweghị ihe ọjọọ ha mere, bụ ndị ọdachi a metụrụ, wutere m nke ukwuu,' President Muhammadu Buhari kwuru. 
Former Nigeria Vice President and presidential candidate in the 2019 elections, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar said: 'We've had many preventable fuel tanker tragedies.	Onye bụbu osote onye isi ala Naịjiria nakwa onye zọrọ ọkwa onye isi ala na ntụli aka 2019, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar kwuru: 'Anyị enwela ọtụtụ ọdachi tanka mmanụ ụgbọala dị mgbochi.

One of the biggest takeaways from the tragedy is that the fire raged for hours with no fire service truck anywhere near the scene of the inferno.	Otu ihe kasị wee ju anya n' ọdachi a bụ na ọkụ gbara ọtụtụ awa mana onweghi trọkụ ndị ọrụ mgbanyụ ọkụ no nso n' akụkụ ebe ọkụ ọgbụgba a.
And like Atiku mentioned, this is one of several petrol tanker accidents in recent times across Nigeria that has led to loss of lives.	Ma dị ka Atiku kwuru, nke a bụ otu n' ime ọtụtụ mberede tanka petrolu na nso a butere ntufu ọtụtụ ndụ na Naijiria gba gburugburu.
Apart from the Otedola bridge fire incident of June 2018 in Lagos that led to loss of lives and the burning of cars, there have been several instances where a petrol laden tanker, flouting all known traffic laws in the land, goes ahead to inflict pain and misery on innocent families and ordinary Nigerians.	E wezụga ọkụ ọgbụgba àkwà mmiri Otedola nke Juun 2018na Legosi nke butere ntufu ọtụtụ ndụ na ọkụ ịgba ụfọdụ ụgbọala, enwere ọmụma atụ ụfọdụ ebe tanka petrolu juru, dara iwu okporo ụzọ niile n' ala anyị, gara n' ihu weta ụfụ na nhụjuanya nye ezinaụlọ enweghị ihe ọjọọ ha mere na ndị Naịjirịa nkịtị.
In Lagos where this writer resides, petrol tanker and articulated truck drivers derive immense joy from intimidating other road users, offloading their containers on busy roads and obstructing free flow of traffic.	Na Legosi ebe odee a bi, tanka petrolu na ndị na-anya ọkara trọkụ na-enwe nnukwu añurị n' iwakpo ndị ọzọ na-aga n' ụzọ anya, na-ebutu ihe akpati ha bu n' ụzọ enweghị ohere na igbochi ụzọ ịga nke ọma.
Articulated trucks and petrol tankers have been a menace in Nigeria for as long as anyone can remember and the regulatory agencies or authorities have largely looked the other way unperturbed for decades.	Ọkara trọkụ na tanka petrolu abụrụla nsogbu na Naijiria kamgbe dịka onye ọbụla nwere ike icheta mana ndị ụlọ ọrụ ma ọ bụ ikike usoro iwu nefuru anya n' ebe ọdị ukwuu.
Until the next disaster.	Ka ọ dị oge ọdachi ọzọ.
'I call on the Ministry of Transport, the Federal Road Safety Commission and other stakeholders to urgently address the issue of safety standards in Nigeria, with a view to stemming the frequency of these tragedies.	'Ana m akpọ ministri njem,' Federal Road Safety Commission' na ndị ọzọ ọ gbasara ka ha gbazie ụkpụrụ nchekwa na Naijiria, n' ụzọ iji belata ọdachi na-adapụta kwa mgbe.
May the souls of the dead rest in peace Amen,' President Buhari said, without stating how he will make sure the agencies he mentioned sanitize our roads and put the killer truck drivers in check.	Ka mkpụrụ obi ndị nwụrụ anwụ zuru ike n' udo Amen, ' Onyeisi ala Buhari kwuru, n' ekwughi ka ọ ga-esi mee ka ndị ụlọ ọrụ ndị ọ kpọrọ aha ga-esi dozie ụzọ anyị ma kwụsị ndị ogbu mmadụ na-anya trọkụ.
Without saying how he'll lead the charge in enforcing compliance.	N' ekwughi ka o siri dị njikere ime ka e huwe isi.
It is also a shame that a state as rich as Anambra has no functioning fire service department or emergency response units; and that when tragedy struck, Governor Willie Obiano was not on the ground to provide succour.	Ọ bụkwuazị ihe ihere na steeti bụ ọgaranya ka Anambra enweghi ngalaba ọrụ ọkụ na-arụ ọrụ ma ọ bụ ngalaba gbata gbata; na mgbe ọdachi dapụtara, Gọvanọ Willie Obiano anọghị ya inweta enyemaka.
At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the Onitsha inferno was completely avoidable. Yet again, we have lost lives to poor governance across all tiers. Writer Ayo Sogunro was right after all when he said 'everything in Nigeria is going to kill you.'	N' ịkọ akụkọ iberibe, ọkụ ọgbụgba Ọnịcha kwesiri mgbochi kpamkpam. Ma ọzọ kwa, anyị etufuola ndụ n' ihi amaghị achị n' ogo ọchịchị niile. Ọdee Ayo Sogunro kwuru ezi okwu n' ezie mgbe o kwuru 'ihe ọbụla na Naijiria na-ga igbu gị.'

I had recently ceased to be Secretary-General of the Students Union and Opeyemi Bamidele (now literally taking the bullets of enemies of democracy in our land) newly sworn in as the Chairman of the Caretaker Committee, pending the election to constitute a new executive.	Akwụsịcharala m ịbụ odeakwụkwọ ukwu nke òtù ụmụ akwụkwọ ma Opeyemi Bamidele (ugbua na-aghọ mgbọ ndị iro ọchịchị onye kwuo uche ya n' ala anyị) ka e duru n' iyi ọrụ ọhụrụ dị ka onyeisi Kọmitii nlekọta, ruo mgbe e mere ntụli aka iguzobe ndị ezekutivu ọhụrụ.
And it was the matter of the election that led to my 'indefinite suspension' — along with Bamidele and two others, in the first instance (eight more followed suit, besides the president of the union) — thereby almost confirming my father's fear the day I informed him of my intention to run for a Students Union office: that I did not intend to graduate!	Ma ọ bụ ihe gbasara ntụli aka a kpatara nkwụsị akwụkwọ enweghị mgbe o jedebere m'--tinyere Bamidele na mmadụ abụọ ndị ọzọ, n' izizi (mmadụ asatọ ọzọ sochikwara, ma e wezụga onyeisi nke òtù) - - n' otu a ọ fọdụrụ obere ịmezu egwu nna m tụrụ ụbọchị m gwara ebumnuche m ịzọpụta ọkwa òtù ụmụ akwụkwọ: na ebughi m n' uche ịgụsị akwụkwọ!
Still smarting from our victory in the fight for the restoration of the union at Uniben — following the unconstitutional ban on student union activities in the wake of the nationwide protests sparked by the murder of four Ahmadu Bello University students by anti-riot policemen precipitately called to quell a peaceful protest (Professor Ango Abdullahi, the vice chancellor, would further outrage the nation by announcing that 'only four students died' as if one were not too many) — Professor Grace Alele-Williams sought to pacify her campus for General Babangida, the reigning military dictator, by issuing intolerable election guidelines.	Ka ọ ka na-eri ahụ ụfụ mmeri anyị meriri n' agha inweghachi òtù ụmụ akwụkwọs n' Uniben-- ka a machiri emume òtù ụmụ akwụkwọ n' ụzọ n' adanyeghi n' iwu ka e mechara ngagharị iwe n' ala anyị gburugburu nke ogbugbu ndị uweojii mgbochi ngagharị iwe a kpọrọ ka kwụsị ngagharị iwe udo gburu ụmụ akwụkwọ anọ nke Mahadum Ahmadu Bello (Ọkammụta Ango Abdullahi, vaịs chanselọ, gara n' ihu kpalite iwe ndị mmadụ site n' ikwuputa na 'sọọsọ ụmụ akwụkwọ anọ nwụrụ' ka a ga-asị n' ótù abaghị nnukwu ụba)--- Ọkammụta Grace Alele-Williams chọrọ imedara Onyeisi agha Babangida, onye agha na-achị ọchịchị aka ike, obi ụlọakwụkwọ ya, site n' inye usoro ntụli aka adịghị nnagide.

Why call it an election, you might ask, but we were then in the early years of Babangida's political witchcraft, hence his dying need to pacify the campuses by emasculating the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), as well as the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), arguably the only organised opposition at the time to the burgeoning military terror. Our suspension was punishment for rallying the students against the obnoxious guidelines, for calling 'on students to boycott' the elections and — of course, they had to add this — 'incit[ing] them to violence and demonstration.'	Gịnị mere e ji kpọọ ntụli aka, i nwere ike ịjụ, mana mgbe ahụ anyị nọ mbido ọtụtụ afọ ọchịchị nchigbu Babangida n' ihi ya ọnwụ ya medara ụlọakwụkwọ dị iche iche obi site n' ịnapụ 'National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), nakwa' Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) ihe ha ji dị ebube, nke dị mgbagha bụ sọ òtù a haziri ahazi maka mbusoagha nyere mmenye ụjọ ndị agha na-etolite etolite.

But that was hardly our only crime.	Mana nke ahụ abụghị sọ ihe ọjọọ anyị mere ma ncha.
At the time of the second petrol price increase by Babangida from 39.5 kobo to 42 kobo per litre — yes, the national currency did have value once upon a time! — the union had barely been inaugurated and so we lacked the platform for an effective protest, with the University of Jos, I believe, leading the way then.	N' oge nke ugboro abụọ Babangida bugoro ọnụ mmanụ ụgbọala site na 39.5 kobo ruo 42 kobo maka otu lita----ee, ego ala anyị bara uru n' ótù oge!--- a ka guzobesiri òtù ọhụrụ nke mere na anyị enweghi ohere ime ngagharị iwe dị írè, Mahadum nke Jos, ekwere m, bu ụzọ mgbe ahụ.
Then Babangida gave us a chance to salve our festering wound of non-participation: the students unions of the universities that shunned 'violence' by not protesting would each be given an eighteen-seater bus to commend their 'maturity.'	Mgbe ahụ Babangida nyere anyị ọhere ịnapụta onwe anyị na nsogbu nke esonyeghi: òtù ụmụ akwụkwọ nke mahadum dị iche iche ga-ajụ 'imesi ike' Site n' emeghi ngagharị iwe ka a ga-enye bọsụ na-ebu mmadụ iri na asatọ iji ja ha maka 'ntozu ọkè.'
Promptly, we made clear what kind of praise or gifts the University of Benin union would accept by holding a rally and rejecting the bribe outright.	N' egbughi oge, anyị mere ka o doo anya ụdị otito na onyinye òtù mahadum nke Benin ga-anata site inwe nnukwu ọgbakọ na ịjụ ngarị a ozugbo.
But the true test of the union's character followed quickly when the university decided to cancel resit examinations.	Mana ezi nnwale agwa òtù a sochiri anya ozugbo ka mahadum kpebiri ịkagbu nlegharị ule.
Resits gave a second chance, a lifeline even, to struggling students, many of whom were indigent, some constrained to do menial work in town to see themselves through school, and who still had to cope with poor living conditions, and non-existent or inadequate learning materials as libraries and laboratories were sapped to 'death' by the IMF/World Bank's Structural Adjustment Programme, imposed by Babangida on the nation despite its total rejection by the people.	Nlegharị ule nyere ọhere nke ugboro abụọ, ọbụna ihe dị nnukwu mkpa, nyere ụmụ akwụkwọ ndị nọ na mgbalị, nke ụfọdụ n'ime ha bụ ndị enweghị ka ọha ha, ụfọdụ n' ime ha ka a manyere ịrụ kirikiri ọrụ dị iche iche n' obodo iji zụọ onwe ha n' akwụkwọ, na ndị na-agide obibi ndụ erughi eru na ngwa ọmụmụ n' adịghị adị ma ọ bụ n' ezughi oké dịka ọba akwụkwọ na ụlọ nyocha nwụgoro site n' atụmatụ 'Structural Adjustment Programme' nke 'IMF/World Bank' Babangida kwanyere ala anyị ịnabata n' agbanyeghi na ndị mmadụ jụrụ ya kpamkpam.
Whatever the merits of the decision, the students would accept it only if living and learning conditions were improved, even if by a mere fifty percent.	Ihe ọ bụla uru mkpebi a nwere ike ịbụ, ụmụ akwụkwọ gaara anabata ya sọsọ ma ọ bụrụ na ọ ga-akwalite ọnọdụ obibi na ọmụmụ, ọbụna n' ọ bụ pesent iri ise nkịtị.

As it happened, she lost the argument and was constrained to restore resit exams for the time being.	Dị ka o mere, e meriri ya n' arụmụka ahụ nke mere ka ọ nweghachi nlegharị ule n' oge a.
That was the last straw.	Nke a bụ ihe ọjọọ ikpeazụ.
Something had to be done.	O kwesiri ka enwe ihe e mere.
And so disregarding our request to examine the evidence and witnesses against us, and for adequate time to prepare our response to the charges of holding a rally, and incitement to demonstration and violence, the university proceeded at break-neck speed to hand us what, in effect, were expulsion letters.	Mana n' elenyeghi anya n' arịrịọ anyị ka e nyochaa mgba àmà na ndị akaebe megide anyị, na inye anyị oge zuru ezu iji kwado nzaghachi nye ebubo niile e boro anyị maka inwe nnukwu ọgbakọ, na mkpalite ngosiputa na ọgbaghara, mahadum gara n' ihu n' egbughi oge inye anyị ihe, na mpụtara, bụ akwụkwọ ozi ọchụchụ.

On the principle of fair hearing alone, our suspension would be annulled by the court, but what to do about the ubiquitous cast-iron ouster clauses in the Constitution (Suspension and Modification) Decree, the Federal Military Government (Supremacy and Enforcement of Powers) Decree, recently reiterated in the Students Union Activities (Control and Regulation) Decree 47?

Kunle Ajibade, would soon after wend his way to the newsrooms of The Guardian, The African Concord, and TheNEWS magazine and Tempo newspaper, the last two as co-founder and editor.

I don't recall precisely the occasion of our first meeting — whether the 1988 Association of Nigerian Authors annual conference at the National Theatre or on one of my many truant jaunts to Lagos to attend this or that reading — but whichever it was, I suspect that I was introduced by the late poet Idzia Ahmad, Ajibade's colleague at Grant.	Echetaghị kpọmkwem oge izizi anyị zutere---ma ọ bụ na 1988 'Association of Nigerian Authors annual Conference' na 'National Theatre' ma ọ bụ n' otu n' ime njem mmụta m mere gaa Legosi ịga gụọ nke a ma ọ bụ nke ahụ n' anataghị ikike---mana nke ọbụla ọ bụ, ana m eche na onye kọwara m bụ ode abụ nwụrụ anwụ, Idzia Ahmad, onye ọrụ Ajibade na 'Grant.'
It was in his days at The African Concord, however, that I really got to know Ajibade.	Mana ọ bụ n' oge ọ nọ na 'The African Concord' ka m jiri mara nnọọ Ajibade.
With the encouragement of Lewis Obi, its editor, and Ohi Alegbe, copy editor, I had begun contributing articles to its pages.	Site n' agbamume Lewis Obi, onye ndezi ya, na Ohi Alegbe, onye ndezi mbipụta, ebidola m ide ihe odide n' ihu akwụkwọ ya.

Ajibade who had begun a series of long interviews of established authors for Weekend Concord, was, it seemed, almost as delighted as my euphoric self and interviewed me for his report as if I were already a bona fide poet, thereby doing wonders for my budding writer's ego!

And so it was that soon after that we would both be in the trenches during the vicious days of the Babangida/Abacha tyranny that culminated in the cruellest evil perpetrated against democracy and our sovereign right to self-determination: the annulment of the June 12, 1993, presidential election.

Ajibade's offence had been no more than publishing General Obasanjo's statement in denial of the ridiculous charge of accessory before the fact of treason, making Ajibade's offence purportedly that of being an accessory after the fact of treason!

Whenever anyone quite solicitously wondered how I coped with six months of preventive detention, I always said that I got away lightly and would cite Ajibade among other human rights and democracy activists given life imprisonment sentences, or who had spent well over a year in the Babangida/Abacha gulag, Ajibade having done three-and-a-half years before freedom came in the wake of his jailer's death.

I was amused when Ngugi wa Thiong'o conceded to Ajibade the status of 'older jailbird' during a conversation with him at the 2016 Ake Arts and Book festival in Abeokuta because he had himself spent only one year in Arap Moi's prison.

Among his peers and even succeeding generations, Falana stands tall as a people's solicitor and advocate, insisting on seeing law as a tool of social engineering rather than merely as a genteel profession of self-satisfied practitioners, best served without a conscience, by keeping silent in the face of tyranny or, even better, taking the side of diabolical governments.

The SSS also claimed in a sworn affidavit that Sowore had travelled to Dubai to collect millions of dollars to overthrow the President Muhammadu Buhari administration.	Ndị SSS na-ekwukwa n' iyi afidaviti ha ñụrụ na Sowore mere njem gaa Dubai ịnara ọtụtụ nde dọla iji kwatu ọchịchị onyeisi ala Muhammadu Buhari.
But when the SSS later found that Sowore had never travelled to Dubai or any part of the United Arab Emirates, the monstrous allegation was jettisoned.	Mana mgbe SSS mechara chọpụta na Sowore ejighị Dubai ma ọ bụ mpaghara ọbụla dị n' 'United Arab Emirates,' ha wepụrụ ebubo arụrụ ala a.
When Mr Omoyele Sowore was arrested on August 3 , 2019, the State Security Service accused him of engaging in terrorist activities.	Mgbe e jidere Maazị Omoyele Sowore n' Ọgọstụ 3, 2019, 'State Security Service' boro ebubo itinye aka n' omume iyi ọha egwu.
On the basis of the allegation, the SSS obtained an order from the Honourable Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja to detain Sowore for 45 days in order to investigate his alleged terrorist activities.	Na ndabere ebubo a, SSS nwetara ikike n' aka Okwesiri nsọpụrụ Jọstis Taiwo Taiwo nke 'Federal High Court,' Abuja ijide Sowore mkpụrụ ụbọchị 45 iji nyochaa ebubo e boro ya banyere omume iyi ọha egwu.
But at the end of the investigation, he was not linked to terrorism in any way.	Mana na ngwụcha nyocha a, e jikọ ya na iyi ọha egwu n' ụdị ọbụla.
Hence, he was not charged with any offence under the Terrorism Prevention Act, 2011 as amended.	N' ihi ya, a gbaghị ya akwụkwọ banyere ihe ọbụla dị na 'Terrorism Prevention Act, dị ka e megharịrị ya na 2011.
The SSS also claimed in a sworn affidavit that Sowore had travelled to Dubai to collect millions of dollars to overthrow the President Muhammadu Buhari administration.	SSS na-ekwukwa n' iyi afidaviti ha ñụrụ na Sowore mere njem gaa Dubai ịnara ọtụtụ nde dọla iji kwatu ọchịchị onyeisi ala Muhammadu Buhari.
But when the SSS later found that Sowore had never travelled to Dubai or any part of the United Arab Emirates, the monstrous allegation was jettisoned.	Mana mgbe SSS mechara chọpụta na Sowore ejighị Dubai ma ọ bụ mpaghara ọbụla dị na 'United Arab Emirates,' ha wepụrụ ebubo arụrụ ala a.
Even though the allegations of terrorism and treasonable felony against Sowore had collapsed like a pack of cards, the Attorney-General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami (SAN), engaged in a face-saving measure by charging him and Olawale Bakare with treasonable felony for planning to organise public protests against the Buhari administration.	N' agbanyeghi na ebubo iyi ọha egwu na ịgba gọọmenti mgba e boro Sowore amaala afọ n' ala ka kadị e kpokoro ọnụ, Ọka iwu izugbe ala anyị, Maazị Abubakar Malami (SAN), chọrọ imechapụ onwe ya ihere n' ihu site n' ịgba Sowore na Olawale Bakare akwụkwọ ịgba gọọmenti mgba maka ime atụmatụ ịchịkọba mkpesa ọha megide ọchịchị Buhari.
Not sure that the charge of treasonable felony would succeed in the court, the AGF proceeded to charge Sowore with cyberstalking for allegedly insulting President Buhari in a television interview and money laundering.	Makana odochaghị anya na akwụkwọ a gbara maka ịgba gọọmenti mgba ga-enwe isi n' ụlọ ikpe, AGF gara n' ihu ịgba Sowore akwụkwọ ichuzo Buhari na nzuzo na saịba maka ebubo ịkparị Onyeisi ala Buhari n' ajụjụ ọnụ a gbara na televishọn na ibupu ego. 
Meanwhile, the organisers of the public protests, which were held in Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Cross River and Osun states were charged with unlawful assembly.	Ugbua, ndị chịkọbara mkpesa nke ọha, nke e mere na steeti ndị a Legosi, Ogun, Ondo, Cross River na Osun ka a gbara akwụkwọ maka inwe ọgbakọ iwu akwadoghi.
The case filed in Ogun State has been dismissed while the defendants have been discharged following the no case submission of the defence counsel, Mr. Effiong Inibehe.

Having met the bail conditions they have regained their freedom.	Ka ha mezuru ọnọdụ mgbapụta ha ha nwetaghachiri nnwere onwe. 
But the orders of Justice Taiwo and Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu for the release of Sowore and Bakare were ignored with impunity by the SSS.	Mana iwu Jọstis Taiwo na Jọstis Ijeoma Ojukwu nyere maka nhapụ Sowore na Bakare ka ndị SSS leghara anya n' enweghị ntaramahụhụ ọbụla.
Although the SSS complied with the court order for the release of Sowore and Bakare within 24 hours' ultimatum, its operatives turned round to manhandle Sowore in the well of the court and later rearested him without any warrant of arrest.	N' agbanyeghi na SSS rubere isi n' iwu ụlọikpe nyere ịhapụ Sowore na Bakare n' awa 24, ndị ọrụ ya tụgharịrị ịkpụtọ Sowore n' ụlọ ikpe ma mecha jidekwa ya ọzọ n' enweghị ihe nyere ha ikike ijide ya.
However, because of the gravity of the charge pending at the Federal High Court, the presiding Judge, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu had ordered the prosecutor to make available to the defendants the statements of all prosecution witnesses while the case was fixed for definite hearing on the 5th and 6th, December, 2019.	Otu ọ dị, n' ihi ịdị ukwuu ikpe a dị na 'Federal High Court,' ọkaikpe nọ n' isi ikpe a Jọstis Ijeoma Ojukwu enyela onye gbara akwụkwọ iwu ka ọ wetara ndị na-azara ọnụ ha nkwuputa ndị niile gbara akaebe akwụkwọ ọ gbara ebe e tinyere ọnụnụ ikpe a na 5th and 6th Disemba, 2019. 
But on account of the refusal of the SSS to comply with the order of Justice Ojukwu for the release of Sowore and Bakare on bail, the defendants were unable to prepare their case.	Mana n' ihi ọjụjụ ndị SSS jụrụ ime ihe Jọstis Ojukwu nyere n' iwu maka mgbapụta Sowore na Bakare, ndị na-azara ọnụ ha enweghị ike ịkwado ikpe ha.
As the SSS refused to comply with the order of court to produce the statements of the prosecution witnesses the case has been further adjourned to February 20, 2020 at the instance of the prosecution counsel.	Dị ka SSS jụrụ ime ihe ụlọ ikpe nyere n' iwu inweta nkwupụta ndị akaebe akwụkwọ a gbara e yighariala ikpe ọzọ na Febrụwarị 20, 2020 n' ihi onye na-ekpere ndị gbara akwụkwọ ikpe.
For wasting the precious time of the trial court, the prosecutor was ordered to pay N100,000 to the defendants in accordance with section 296 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015.	Maka igbu oge ụlọ ikpe a nọ na ya ekpe ikpe, e nyere onye gbara akwụkwọ iwu ka ọ kwụọ ndị na-azara ọnụ ha narị puku naịra dị ka nkeji 296 nke 'administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015' siri kwu.
The prosecutor has since paid the said cost.	Onye gbara akwụkwọ akwụọla ego a kamgbe.
It is therefore embarrassing that the Federal Government which has found it difficult to prove its case in a competent court of law has resorted to the media trial of Sowore.	Ya mere na ọ bụ ihe ihere na gọọmenti etiti nke o siri ike iziputa ikpe ya n' ụlọ ikpe ruru eru nke iwu amalitela ikpe Sowere ikpe na midia.
Thus, in a press statement on Sunday, December 8, 2019, a presidential spokesperson, Mr Garba Shehu claimed that 'Sowore called for a revolution to overthrow the democratically elected government of Nigeria.'	Otu a, n' okwu edere ede ụbọchị ụka, Disemba 8, 2019, onye okwuchite okwu onyeisi ala, Maazị Garba Shehu kwuru 'Sowore kpọrọ maka mgbanwe ịkwatu gọọmenti nkịtị a họpụtara na Naijiria.'
In comparing Sowore with the Boko Haram sect, the Presidency said, 'Nigeria is already dealing with an insurgency that has left millions of people displaced and desperate in the North-East region of country.	N' iji Sowere tụnyere ndị òtù Boko Haram, ụlọ ọrụ onyeisi ala kwuru 'Naijiria na-ebu agha megide ndị agha isiaba okpu ugbua nke chụpụrụ nde mmadụ n' ebe obibi ha n' mgbago-ọwụwa anyanwụ nke obodo a.
The Boko Haram militants, who are behind the violence, also fancy themselves to be fighting for some sort of revolution.	Ndị agha Boko Haram, ndị na-ebute ọgba aghara, na-ahụkwa onwe ha ka ndị nwere ụdị mgbanwe ha na-achọ.
The link is a justification for the planned arraignment of Sowore for terrorism.	Njikọ a bụ ihe kpatara e ji kpụpụta Sowore maka iyi ọha egwu.
Since it is common knowledge that Sowore and Bakare are not among the well known merchants of violence and coup plotters that had successfully but illegally removed democratically elected governments in Nigeria, we are not going to join issues with Mr Shehu over the highly contemptuous statements credited to him.	Kamgbe ọ bụ ihe onye ọbụla mara na Sowere na Bakare esoghị na ndị mgbere ọgba aghara a ma ama na ndị mkwatu ọchịchị wepụrụla n' ụzọ n' akwụghị ọtọ gọọmenti ndị nkịtị a họpụtara na Naijiria, anyị na Shehu agaghị ese ọnụ banyere okwu nnukwu mkparị a sị na o kwuru.
But as a senior journalist, Mr Shehu ought to have known that it is highly unprofessional to subject a man held incommunicado to scurrilous attacks in the media.	Mana dị ka nnukwu onye nta akụkọ, Maazị Shehu kwesiri ịma na ọ dịghị ka ihe ọkachamara ikwanye onye e ji amaghị ebe ọ nọ na mkparị na midia.
We are however, convinced that Sowore will have a right of reply once the fundamental rights of the Nigerian people are restored.	Otu ọ dị, o doro anyị anya na Sowere ga-enwe ikike izaghachi ozugbo e weghachiri. ikike dịrị onye nke ndị Naịjirịa.
Even though the Federal Government has failed to engage in the diligent prosecution of the serious case, the Presidency has resorted to media trial while the charge of treasonable felony is allowed to hang menacingly on the heads of our clients.	N' agbanyeghi na Gọọmenti etiti enweghị ike ịkpachara anya n' ikpe ikpe ndị siri ike, ụlọ ọrụ onyeisi ala amalitela ikpe ikpe banyere midia ebe ịgba akwụkwọ ịgba gọọmenti mgba nọ ndị anyị na-ekpere ikpe n' isi n' ụdị na-eyi egwu.

On Saturday, he reassured his teeming fans and answered lots of questions.	N' ụbọchị Satọdee, ọ kwekwara ndị ihe ya na-amasị nkwa ọzọ ma zaa ọtụtụ ajụjụ.
Those answers came with quick jabs, timely hooks, and calculated movements, all delivered in a 36 minutes show of clinical finish.	Azịza ndị ahụ bụ banyere ịkụ ọkpọ ngwa ngwa, ịkpọ nku aka n' oge okwesiri na ije a gbakọrọ agbakọ, inye ha ncha n' ime ngosi nkeji 36 klinikal finishi. 
With the comeback victory, Joshua joined Muhammad Ali, Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield, Floyd Patterson and Mike Tyson in the league of men to have reclaimed the world heavyweight title.	Maka mmeri nlọghachite azụ a, Joshua sonyeere Muhammad Ali, Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield, Floyd Patterson na Mike Tyson n' òtù ụmụ nwoke ndị bughachiterela ihe nrite 'heavyweight' ụwa niile.
In this historical moment, there are lessons to learn from a man that came back from the dead to knock out the same person that gifted him his first career defeat.

Fela Kuti lives on	Fela Kuti ka dị ndụ.
Ahead of his much-anticipated fight with Ruiz in Saudi Arabia, Joshua paid homage to his Nigerian roots.	Tupu ọgwụ a tụrụanya ya nke ukwuu dị n' etiti ya Ruiz na Saudi Arabia, Joshua zọrọ ụkwụ na Naijiria ebe o si.
The British boxer with Nigerian parents chose a tune by Nigerian multi-talented musician, Fela Kuti, as his entrance song.	Ọkụ ọkpọ Britain a nne na nna bụ ndị Naịjirịa họrọ egwu nke si n' aka ọkụ egwu Naijiria nwere onyinye dị iche iche, Fela Kuti, ka egwu mbata ya.
The song, Water No Get Enemy by Fela, a trailblazer of Afrobeat music and a fearless human rights activist, was perfect for the occasion and a precursor for a historic night.	Egwu a, 'Water No Get Enemy' nke si n' aka Fela, ọsụ ụzọ egwu 'Afrobeat' obuagha ikike dịrị mmadụ na-anaghị atụ egwu, kwesiri ọnọdụ a nke ọma mana na-arutu aka n' abalị dị mkpa n' akụkọ ihe mere eme.

This victorious match reminded everyone of Fela's undying legacy.	Machị mmeri a chetara onye ọbụla ihe nlereanya Fela dị anwụ anwụ.
Stay hungry for a win	Nọdụ n' agụụ mmeri
There are no friends in the ring, and the best way to come out of the ring victorious is by inflicting damage on the opponent.	Enweghi enyi n' ogige ịkụ ọkpọ, ma ụzọ kasị mma iji jiri mmeri si n' ogige ịkụ ọkpọ pụta bụ site n' imerụ onye iro gị ahụ.
In the first match in New York, it was apparent that Joshua lacked the hunger needed for victory.	Na machị nke izizi na Nu Yọk, o woro anya na Joshua enweghi agụụ a chọrọ maka mmeri.
After hitting the canvas in the third round, Joshua appeared lost and uncoordinated; he struggled through the remaining rounds before the referee waved the fight off.	Ka ọ kụsiri kanvasi na ugboro nke atọ, ọ dịka Joshua enwetaghị onwe ya ma ọ chịkọtaghị onwe ya, ọ gbalịrị n' ugboro ndị fọrọ afọ tupu referii egbubie ọgwụ ahụ.
In the rematch, it was evident that Joshua was hungry for a victory.	Na nnwegharị machị, o doro anya na agụụ mmeri na-agụ Joshua.
He was there to prove a point and retrieve his lost belts that were on exile in California.	Ọ nọ ebe ahụ igosi ebumnuche ya ma weghachite beltu ya o tụfuru nọ n' ala Kalifonịa.
The hunger reflected in the superb head and body movement aimed at dodging Ruiz's punches.	Agụụ a gosiri ọmarịcha ụzọ o si emegharị isi na ahụ iji zere ọkpọ Ruiz.
If there were anything Joshua learned after his defeat, it would be to stay hungry in the face of any opposition.	Ọ bụrụ na onwere ihe Joshua mụtara ka e merisiri ya, ọ ga-abụ ịnọ n' agụụ n' ihu ihe chere ya aka mgba.
Stick to the game plan	Jidesie atụmatụ egwuregwu ike.
Before his first match with Ruiz, everyone was used to Joshua decapitating his opponents before the final round with an exception for the bout with Joseph Parker.	Tupu Maachị izizi ya na Ruiz, ọ marala onye ọbụla na Joshua na-emeri onye ha abụọ na-agba mgba tupu ugboro nke ikpe azụ beeresọ ọkpọ ya na Joseph Parker kụrụ.
For many of the fans, they wanted to see an angry Joshua in the ring with a shower of punches to revenge his humiliating loss in June.	N' ọtụtụ ndị faan nọ, ha chọrọ ịhụ Joshua iwe juru obi n' ogige mgba ga-eji ọtụtụ ọkpọ bọọ ọbọ nfulahu mmebọ ọ nwere na Juun.
It was not a big ask from a man that has 21 knockouts out of 22 professional wins.	O bughi ibu ịtụnanya ihe dị otú a n' aka nwoke nwere nkutu 21 n' ime mmeri 22 o meriri n' ọrụ ya.
Let the 'champ' do the magic again.	Ka onye mmeri a mee anwansi a ọzọ.
While that seems like a brilliant plan that could drive the fans wild, it would have placed Joshua in a vulnerable position resulting in a second defeat.	Ka nke ahụ dị ka atụmatụ amamihe ga-enye ndị faan nnukwu obi añurị, ọ gaara etinye Joshua n' Ọnọdụ ọjọọ ga-ebutere ya mmeri nke ugboro abụọ.
It would have been a blatant display power without tactfulness.	Ọ gaara abụ igosi ike ghe anya oghe n' enweghị akọ.
It is quite understandable if the critics wanted a spectacular match, but often, the key to victory is taking calculated risks and not doing what everyone expects.	Ọ kwere nghọta n' ezie ma ọ bụrụ na ndị nkatọ chọrọ machị pụrụ iche, mana mgbe ụfọdụ, isi mmeri bụ ịgbakọọ ihe ize ndụ ị na-ara na ọbụghị ihe onye ọbụla chere.
Joshua understood the difference between showmanship and professionalism.	Joshua ghọtara ihe dị iche n' etiti oké ihe ngosi na igosi nkà n' ọrụ.
He took the stance of a professional pugilist and displayed a tactical understanding of the sport to wear out his opponent.	Ọ were ọnọdụ ọkachamara n' ịkụ ọkpọ ma gosi nghọta usoro pụrụ iche nke egwuregwu iji mee ka ike gwụ onye ha abụọ na-akụ ọkpọ.
Boxing is all about taking well-timed punches and avoid getting hit.	Ihe dị n' ịkụ ọkpọ bụ ide ede wee kụọ ma zeere ịkuta gị.
That was the game plan, and a disciplined Joshua stuck to the plan from start to finish.	Nke ahụ bụ atụmatụ egwuregwu a, mana Joshua a zụrụ azụ jidesiri atụmatụ a ike site na mbido ruo na njedebe.
Joshua never allowed Ruiz to lock him a close range that is advantageous to a speedy boxer like Ruiz.	Joshua enyeghi Ruiz ohere ịnọ ya nnukwu nso nke bụ uru onye na-akụ ọkpọ ọsọ ọsọ dị ka Ruiz.
He made use of his long legs by pacing in the ring, which not only frustrated his opponent but prevented Ruiz from landing his punches in a close range.	O jiziri ogologo ụkwụ ya nke ọma site n' ịgbagharị n' ime ogige ịkụ ọkpọ, nke n' emeghị naanị ka onye ya na ya na-eme ihe daa mbà kama ọ gbochiri Ruiz ịkụ ọkpọ ya n' ebe ọ dị nso.
Those powerful jabs courtesy of Joshua's long-range paid off in the match against his Mexican rival.	Ịdụ ọkpọ ndị ahụ dị ike si n' ebe Joshua nọtere aka kwụtara ụgwọ na ọkpọ ya na onye Mexico kụrụ.
Joshua practically animated Mohammed Ali's words, 'Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.	Joshua mere ka okwu Mohammed Ali pụta ìhè nke ukwuu, 'See n' elu ka nru ububa, gbaa ka anwụ.
The hands can't hit what the eyes can't see.'	Aka enweghị ike ịkụta ihe anya enweghị ike ịhụ.'
Stay focused on the prize	Lekwasị anya n' ihe nrite
On the road to success, the focus is paramount.	N' ụzọ ọganihu, nlekwasị anya kasị mkpa.
In the build-up to the rematch, Joshua was under immense pressure, and he could not afford a second defeat. 	Na nkwado ịkụgharị ọkpọ, Joshua nọ na nnukwu mgbali, na ọ gaghị ekwe ka e merie ya nke ugboro abụọ.
In the ring, it's hard to stay focused on a plan after suffering a devastating hit.	N' ogige ịkụ ọkpọ, ọ siri ike ịnọ na nlekwasị anya n' atụmatụ ma a kụta gị ọkpọ n' emebi isi.
However, it pays to stay focused and avoid any unexpected complications from surprise hooks.	Ka o sina dị, ọ na-akwụ ụgwọ ịnọ na nlekwasị anya ma zere nsogbu a tụghị anya si nko mberede.
Before the rematch, Joshua was hard on himself with a laser-focused training regimen.	Tupu nkụgharị ọkpọ, Joshua emeghiri onwe ya ebere n' usoro ọzụzụ nlekwasị anya-lase.
He trimmed his weight to 237 pounds, his lowest in five years (lost 10 pounds in six months).	O belatara ibu ya ruo paụndụ 237, ọkasị ala ya n' ime afọ ise (o tụfuru paụndụ 10 n' ọnwa isii).
It takes focus and discipline to do that.	Ọ were nlekwasị anya na ọzụzụ ime nke ahụ.
In sharp contrast to Joshua's approach, Andy Ruiz added 16 pounds to his chubby frame, which impacted his movement in the ring.	Na ndịiche ghe anya oghe n' ụdị Joshua si eme ihe, Andy Ruiz gbakwunyere paundu 16 n' ọdịdị ahụ ya nke metụtara ije ya n' ogige ịkụ ọkpọ.
It's hard to keep up with six months of uninterrupted media attention and sudden fame.	O siri ike ijigide nlekwasị anya ndị nta akụkọ ọnwa isii akwusịghị akwụsị na iwu ewu mberede.
Bouncing back from an embarrassing loss is hard.	Isi na nfulahu mmebọ lọghachi azụ sịrị ike.
But Joshua forgot about the mixed feelings of the past and focused on the next 36 minutes of his life in the ring – the moment that decides what happens next in his boxing career.	Mana Joshua chefuru maka mmetụta agwaraogwa nke ihe gara aga ma lekwasị anya na nkeji 36 nke ndụ ya n' ime ogige ịkụ ọkpọ---oge nta ga-ekpebi ihe ọzọ ga-eme n' ọrụ ịkụ ọkpọ ya.
With eyes on the prize and a heart bent on winning, he earned his titles back amidst cheers and applause from a satisfied audience.	N' anya ịdị n' onyinye nke onye gbara mbọ na obi kpebisiri ike imeri, ọ nwetaghachiri ihe nrite ya azụ n' etiti mkpu ọṅụ na ịkụ aka si na ndị nkiri afọ juru.
Punch your fears in the face	Kụọ egwu gị ọkpọ n' ihu.
Preceding the match in New York, Joshua was an undefeated unified heavyweight champion.	Tupu mgba ahụ na New York, Joshua bụbu onye mmeri jikọrọ 'heavyweight' anaghị emeri emeri.
Although he had a close shave with defeat in his match against Wladimir Klitschko, he bounced back after a knockdown in the sixth round.	N' agbanyeghi n' ọ fọdụrụ obere ka e merie ya na machị ya na Vladimir Klitschko nwere, ọ laghachiri n' ụdị ya n' ugboro nke isii.
His first taste of defeat in his professional career was against Ruiz in June, and he lost to an underdog that was unknown to anyone before the match.	Mmeri izizi e meriri ya n' ọrụ ya bụ ka ọ kụrụ ọkpọ megide Ruiz na Juun, nke onye adịghị ike enweghị onye mara ya tupu machị ahụ meriri ya. 
The fears of losing again must have haunted Joshua in the past few months, but his fighting spirit during the rematch showed the traits of a champion.	Egwu ịda ọzọ na-achụgharị Joshua n' ime ọnwa ole na ole gara aga, mana mụọ ibu agha n' oge nkụgharị ọkpọ gosiri agwa onye mmeri.
Former heavyweight champion, Mike Tyson, once said, 'Fear is just like fire;	Onye meriri 'heavyweight' na mbụ, Mike Tyson, kwuru n' otu oge, 'Egwu dị nnọọ ka ọkụ;

Our fears are as strong as the belief we put in them.	Egwu na-atụ anyị dị ike ka nkwenye anyị tinyere n' ime ha.
Joshua stepped into the ring and used his fears to his advantage; he faced his demons and punched them until they got exhausted.	Joshua zọnyere ụkwụ n' ogige ịkụ ọkpọ ma were egwu ya mee ihe bara ya uru; ọ chere ajọ mmụọ ya ihu ma kụwa ha ọkpọ ganye n' ike agwụla ha.

A couple of weeks after the 2019 presidential elections, I met Omoyele Sowore at the Sahara Reporters' Civic Media Lab and after we exchanged pleasantries in his usual 'hey professor' way, he told me in a sombre tone how travelling across Nigeria during his one year intensive campaigns had made him (upon his brief return to the United States) value things he had hitherto taken for granted having been practically away for twenty years.	Ka izu ụka ole na ole gachara ka e mesiri ntụli aka onyeisi ala na 2019, ezutere m Omoyele Sowore na 'Sahara Reporters' Civic Media Lab,' ka anyi kelesiri n' ụdị o si eme ya na mbụ ' heyi Ọkammụta', ọ gwara n' olu mwute ka ịga njem Naijiria gburugburu n' oge nnukwu achụmnta votu emeela ya (n' ime ịlọghachi azụ ya n' Amerịka nwa oge) ịma uru ihe ndị nwere ka ihe efu bara dịka ọ nọrọ Amerịka afọ iri abụọ doro anya.
Sowore told me how he came to appreciate the leaders of America for the good roads, stable power, modern schools, world-class health care, mortgage facilities, welfare programs, etcetera.	Sowore gwara ka o si bido nwewe afọ ojuju n' ebe ndị na-achị Amerịka nọ maka ezigbo ụzọ, ọkụ dị agbanwe agbanwe, ụlọakwụkwọ ọgbara ọhụrụ, nleta ahụ ike bụ ịgba, ngwa ịgba mbibi maka ụlọ, atụmatụ ọdịmma, wee dịrị gawa.

When he was done talking, I said the following words:	Ka o kwusiri okwu, ekwuru m okwu ndị a:

What is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that.

Even though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.

My point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.

When Dele Giwa was assassinated on October 19, 1986, the major suspects were the two security operatives of the General Ibrahim Babangida junta.	Mgbe e gburu Dele Giwa n' Ọktoba 19, 1986, ndị bụ isi ndị a na-enyo enyo bụ ndị ọrụ nchekwa abụọ nke iwere ọchịchị n' ike General Ibrahim Babangida.
In an attempt to shift the focus from them, they procured some Nigerians to peddle false narratives, accusing Dele's wife and his colleagues as the main suspects.

Also in 1986, Alozie Ogugbuaja, then the Lagos spokesperson for police, ran into troubled waters over his accusations against the military government for not funding the police.	Ọzọkwa n' afọ 1986, Alozie Ogugbuaja, mgbe ahụ okwuchite ọnụ ndị uwe ojii Lagos, dabara na nsogbu banyere ebubo ọ boro ọchịchị ndị agha maka enweputaghị ego maka ndị uwe ojii.
He was suspended.	A kwụsịrị ya ọrụ.
Thereafter, the agents of the junta went after his life.	Ka nke a, ndị ozi inwere ọchịchị n' ike chọwara ndụ ya.
A grenade was thrown from a moving vehicle at him but it refused to detonate.	E si n' ụgbọala na-aga aga tụọ ya ogbunigwe mana ọ jụrụ ịgbasuu.
Instead of standing by their man, the police IG, Gambo, said the grenade was 'harmless' and must have fallen from a moving vehicle.	Kama ịkwụnyere onye nke ha, onyeisi ndị uwe ojii, Gambo, sịrị na ogbunigwe a adịghị ajọ nakwa n' ọ ga-abụrịrị ụgbọala na-aga aga dapụta.

They always have odious lies to peddle.	Ha na-enwe asị jọgburu onwe ya mgbe ọbụla.
In 1988, agents of Babangida junta set fire on Gani Fawehinmi's house at 28 Sabiu Ajose Crescent, Surulere, Lagos, housing his library and his second wife and her children.	N' 1988, ndị ozi inwere ọchịchị n' ike nke Babangida mụnyere ụlọ Gani Fawehimi ọkụ na 28 Sabiu Ajose Crescent, Surulere Lagos, nke bu ọba akwụkwọ ya na nwunye nke abụọ na ụmụ ya.
Guess what the police said?	Kaa ihe ndị uwe ojii kwuru?
In an attempt to change the narrative of their dastardly action, they accused Gani Fawehinmi of setting his house on fire 'in order to embarrass the government'.	Iji mee ka agbanwe akụkọ omume jọgburu onwe ya hà mere, ha boro Gani Fawehimi ebubo ịgba ụlọ ya ọkụ 'iji imechu gọọmenti ihu'.
A livid Fawehinmi countered the police - 'You mean l would set fire on my house, housing my wife and children and books worth millions of naira just to embarrass a government that is already embarrassed? You must be insane like your useless government'.	Fawehimi onye iwe na-eto afọ gbaghara ihe ndị uwe ojii kwuru-- 'I chere na m ga-amunye ụlọ m, bu nwunye m na ụmụ m na akwụkwọ ruru ọtụtụ nde Naịra sọsọ maka imechu gọọmenti ihu? I ga-abụrịrị onye ara ka gọọmenti gị n' abaghị uru'.
In 1996, after the assassination of Alhaja Kudirat Abiola by the agents of Abacha junta, the security agencies, also in an attempt to shift the accusations from them, arrested some NADECO chieftains, accused them of being behind the gruesome act till a court ordered their release.	N' 1996, ka ndị ozi inwere ọchịchị n ike nke Abacha gbusiri Alhaja Kudirat Abiola, ndị ụlọ ọrụ nchekwa, ọzọkwa n' iji mee ka e bupu ebubo a n' ebe ha nọ, jidere ụfọdụ ndị isi NADECO, bo ha ebubo ịma isi omume ajọ obi a ganye n' ụlọ ikpe enye iwu ka a hapụ ha.
Of course, Nigerians knew that Abacha's Strike Force was behind the gruesome act.	N' ezie, ndị Naijiria mara na ọ bụ ndị na-egburu Abacha mmadụ mere omume ajọ obi a.
Now, after the show of shame inside the Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday, the perpetrators have equally procured some people to retail some puerile and jejune narrative that it was Omoyele Sowore and his team that simulated the scene in order to blackmail the security agency.	Ugbua, ka e mesiri ihe ngosi na-eme ihere n' ime 'Federal High Court' n' Abuja n' ụbọchị Fraịdee, ndị aka ha dị na ya enwetala ụfọdụ mmadụ ibusa akụkọ ụmụaka na akụkọ n' atọghị ụtọ na ọ bụ Omoyele Sowore na ndị otu ya cheputara ihe merenụ iji mebie aha ndị ọrụ nchekwa.

Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), was the most notable name in attendance as Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the Lagos State Governor-Elect, and his running mate Obafemi Hamzat received their certificates of return from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) at a ceremony held at the commission's office in Yaba, Lagos Mainland, on Friday.

A near impossible and rare feat is to impeach a United States' president.	Ihe dị ka ihe ekweghị omume na ihe dị ụkọ bụ ịchụtu onyeisi ala mba Amerịka.
The president must have committed, either bribery, treason or other serious crimes or misdemeanors.	Onyeisi ala a narịrị ngarị ma ọ bụ, gbaa mgba okpuru ma ọbụ mpụ ndị ọzọ siri ike ma ọ bụ na ọ dara iwu.
Even at that, in the present clime, it is almost impossible to believe that the Republican members of Congress in the Senate would pass such a bill if presented with one by the lower House of Representatives.	Ọ bụrụgodu otu a, ka ihu igwe dị ugbua, ọ dị ka ihe ekweghi omume ikweta na ndị òtù 'Republican' nọ na 'Congress' na sineti ga-ekwe ka a nabata ụdị iwu a ma ọ bụrụ na ụlọ nnọchiteanya nke nta wetara ha ya. 
After the American civil war and President Abraham Lincoln's death, his Vice President, Andrew Johnson became the 17th president of the US, Johnson, had radical ideas and constantly was at loggerheads with the Congress by vetoing certain bills.	Ka a lụsịrị agha ndị nkịtị n' Amerịka na ọnwụ Onyeisi ala Abraham Lincoln, osote ya, Andrew Johnson bụrụ onyeisi ala nke 17 nke US, Johnson nwere echiche nnupụisi ma na-enweta ọgba aghara n' aka ndị 'congress' kwa mgbe maka ịkwado ụfọdụ iwu.
In 1867 when he replaced the Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, a man appointed by Lincoln who supported the Radical Republicans, a breakaway group of the party who believed in the civil rights of freed African Americans, Congress pushed hard and presented eleven articles of impeachment alleging that President Johnson had violated what is known as the 'Tenure of Office Act', that is, a law meant to limit presidential power to remove federal appointees from office without consulting the Senate.	N' 1867 mgbe o dochiri ode akwụkwọ nke agha, Edwin Stanton, nwoke Lincoln wepụtara onye kwadoro nnupụisi ndị 'Republican', otu ndị si ná pati gbọwara ndị kwenyere n' ikike dịrị onye ndị Afrika-Amerika nwerela onwe ha, 'congress' gbalịsiri ike ma weta isiokwu iri na otu nke nchụtụ n' ọkwa na-ekwu na Johnson e metọọla ihe a mara dị ka 'Tenure of office act', nke pụtara iwu e mere maka ibelata ikike onyeisi ala nwere iwepu ndị gọọmenti etiti họpụtara n' ụlọ ọrụ n' emeghị ka sineti mara.
Eventually, in 1868, President Johnson was successfully impeached by a two- thirds majority of the House. This act was deemed unconstitutional years later by the Supreme Court.	N' ikpeazụ, n' afọ 1968, a chụturu onyeisi ala Johnson n' ọchịchị site ọnụ Ọgụgụ ka ụba nke abụọ n' ụzọ atọ. Ka ọtụtụ afọ gasịrị ụlọ ikpe ukwu hụtara omume a dị ka ihe usoro iwu ọchịchị obodo akwadoghi.
President Johnson was not removed from office because a single vote from seven Republicans who voted with the Democrats saved his position.	E wepughi Onyeisi ala Johnson n' ọchịchị makana nanị otu votu nke si n' aka ndị 'Republican' asaa nke so ndị Democrat tụnyere ya zọpụtara ọnọdụ ya. 
A Historian, Hans L. Trefousse wrote, 'The weakness of the case convinced many that the charges were largely political and that the violation of the Tenure of Office Act constituted neither a crime nor a violation of the Constitution but merely a pretext for Johnson's opponents.'	Otu onye akụkọ ihe mere eme, Hans L. Trefousse dere, 'Adịghị ike okwu a doro ọtụtụ mmadụ anya na ebubo n' ụzọ dị ukwuu bụ maka ndọrọndọrọ ọchịchị nakwa na nnupụisi na' Tenure of office act ' esoghị n' ime mpụ nke ọ n' abụ ịnụpụ isi n' usoro iwu ọchịchị obodo kama nanị ngosiputa ndị ihu ha na Johnson echeghi.'
Interestingly, this historic case set the tone in Washington for future Presidential impeachments to follow, namely that no President should ever be impeached for political reasons but should be impeached for 'treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors' as clearly stated by the U.S. Constitution.	N' ịkpali mmasị, akụkọ ihe mere eme a tọrọ ụkpụrụ ịchụtu onyeisi ala na Washington n' ọdịnihu ga-ana eso, ya bụ na onweghi onyeisi ala a ga-achụtu n' ihi ndọrọndọrọ ọchịchị kama maka ihi 'ịgba mgba okpuru, iri ngarị ma ọ bụ mpụ dị elu ndị ọzọ na ịda iwu' dị ka usoro iwu ọchịchị U. S. kwuru n' doro anya.
Using the same paintbrush of which hunting for political reasons, the White House has repeatedly dismissed claims by the Democrats that top government officials had pressured leaders of other nations, namely Ukraine, to investigate the former U.S. Vice President and 2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in the personal and political interest of President Trump.	N' iji otu iko nke nchụgharị n' ihi ndọrọndọrọ ọchịchị wee ma, 'White House' enepula anya ugboro ugboro n' ebubo ndị 'Democrat' na ndị isi ọchịchị amanyela ndị ndu nke mba ndị ọzọ, n' ịkpọ aha Ukraine, inyocha osote onyeisi ala U. S. mbụ na onye ga-azọrọ ndị 'Democrat' ọkwa onyeisi ala n' afọ 2020, Joe Biden, na nwa ya nwoke, Hunter Biden, na mmasị nke onwe nakwa nke ndọrọndọrọ ọchịchị nke onyeisi ala Trump.
President Trump has been quoted publicly as bragging that the Democrats have 'no grounds to impeach.'	E kwuola ihe onyeisi ala Trump kwuru n' ihu ọha dị ka itu ọnụ na ndị 'Democrat' 'enweghị ebe mgbakwasị ụkwụ iji chụtu ya.'
He claims he has done 'nothing wrong or illegal' in light of the formal impeachment proceedings against him recently.	'Ọ na-ekwu na onweghi ihe ọjọọ ma ọ bụ ihe iwu n' akwadoghi ya mere' banyere okwu iwu nchụtụ a na-ekwu megide ya na nso a.
In 1972, when the Watergate scandal broke, the 37th president of the US, Richard, Nixon struggled to cover up his direct involvement in the burgling and trespassing of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington.	N' afọ 1972, mgbe nkwụtọ Watergate pụtara ìhè, onyeisi ala US nke 37, Richard Nixon, gbalịrị ikpuchi ka aka ya si dị kpọmkwem n' mgbaka na njehie isi ụlọ ọrụ 'National Democratic Committee' dị na ụlọ ọrụ Watergate na Washington.
The scandal was intertwined with multiple cases of abuse of power of officials of the Nixon administration, which culminated in the commencement of an impeachment process against him. 	Nkwụtọ a na ọtụtụ mmetọ ike ọchịchị nke ndị ji ọkwa ọchịchị n' ọchịchị Nixon nwere njikọ chiri anya, nke digidere ruo n' ibido usoro nchụtu megide ya.
Apart from the overwhelming evidence of cash found on the five burglars of the DNC headquarters leading back to Nixon's Staff, the investigation revealed that President Nixon had a tape recording system in his offices where private conversations were recorded.	E wezụga ihe akaebe doro anya nke ego e nwetara n' ahụ ndị ohi nke isi ụlọ ọrụ DNC na-arụgara ndị ọrụ Nixon aka, nchọpụta gosiri na onyeisi ala Nixon nwere ihe usoro ndekọ okwu nke teepu n' ụlọ ọrụ ya ebe ọ dekọrọ mkparịta ụka abughi nke ọha.
After grueling court battles, the Supreme Court ruled that the President was obligated to release the infamous tapes to government investigators.	Ka agha ụlọ ikpe na-agwụ ike gachara, ụlọ ikpe ukwu kpebiri na iwu ji onyeisi ala iweputara ndị nchọcha gọọmenti teepu ọjọọ ahụ niile.
The tapes bore damning evidence that President Nixon was irrefutably involved in the break-in of the DNC office and abuse of power to cover up the investigation.	Teepu ahụ gbara akaebe adịghị mgbagha na aka onyeisi ala dị na mgbaka nke ụlọ ọrụ DNC na mmetọ ike ọchịchị iji kpuchie nchọpụta ya.
In light of a predictable impeachment, on 9 August 1974, Nixon resigned his turbulent presidency.	N' itule nchụtu nwere ike ịpụta, n' Ọgọstụ 9 1974, Nixon pụrụ n' ọkwa onyeisi ala ya jupụtara n' ọgba aghara. 
'Watergate' the name became synonymous with political or public scandal not just in the United States but globally as well.	'Watergate' aha ahụ bụrụ ihe e ji mara nkwụtọ ndọrọndọrọ ọchịchị ma ọ bụ nke ọha ọ bụghị sọ n' Amerịka kama ụwa niile gbaa gburugburu.
On October 8, 1998, the United States House of Representatives commenced impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton, the 42nd president of the U.S. under the accusation of 'high crimes and misdemeanors'.	N' Ọktoba 8,1998, ụlọ nnọchiteanya nke Amerịka bidoro usoro nchụtu megide onyeisi ala Bill Clinton, onyeisi ala U.S. nke 42, maka ebubo 'mpụ dị elu na ịda iwu'.
The reasons were for lying under oath and obstruction of justice tied to the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Clinton by a woman named Paula Jones.	Ihe ndị kpatara ya bụ maka ịtụ asị n' iyi ọ ñụrụ na igbochi ikpe mkwụmọtọ nke gbadoro ụkwụ na akwụkwọ mmanye mmekọahụ nwaanyị a na-akpọ Paula Jones gbara megide Clinton.
This would be the second time an American president would be impeached where the House formally adopted the articles of impeachment and forwarded them to the Senate for adjudication.	Nke a ga-abụ nke ugboro abụọ a ga-achụtu onyeisi ala mba Amerịka n' ọchịchị ebe ụlọ nnọchiteanya nabatara edide nchụtu n' ụdị ma zigara ya sineti maka mkpebi.
I remember vividly the frenzy by paparazzi when the proceedings of impeachment began in January 1999 with the Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding.	Echetara m nke ọma ime ara ara nke onye oze foto mgbe usoro nchụtu bidoro na Jenụwarị 1999 nke Chiifu Jọstis William Rehnquist nọ n' isi ya.
After sensational interviews and depositions, President Bill Clinton was acquitted on February 12, 1999, on both counts of high crimes and misdemeanors as neither charges received the necessary two- thirds majority vote of the Senators present for conviction and removal from office.	Ka a gbasiri ya ajụjụ ọnụ n' akpali akpali ma wega azịza ya n' ụlọ ikpe, a hapụrụ onyeisi ala Bill Clinton na Febrụwarị 12, 1999, n' ikpe abụọ nke mpụ dị elu na ịda iwu ka onweghi nke nwetara ọnụ ọgụgụ votu ka ụba nke abụọ n' ụzọ atọ ndị Sineti nọ ya maka amamikpe na mwepụ n' ụlọ ọrụ.
President Bill Clinton remained in office for the rest of his second term.	Onyeisi ala Bill Clinton nọrọ ọchịchị ganye na ngwụcha agba abụọ nke ọchịchị ya.
Donald J. Trump won the Electoral College with 304 votes compared to 227 votes for Hillary Clinton despite pre-election nationwide polls that predicted she would win.	Donald J. Trump ji votu 304 merie ndi nnọchiteanya ntụli aka n' ịtụnyere votu 227 Hillary Clinton n' agbanyeghi nhọpụta mba dum tupu ntụli aka buru amụma na ọ ga-eme win.
Globally women had been excited as her victory would have been a symbol of gender equality with a female being the leader of the free world, the great United States of America, land of dreams. 	N' ụwa niile ụmụ nwaanyị enweela obi ụtọ na mmeri ya gaara abụ akara nhatanha okike maka nwaanyị ịbụ onye ndu nke ụwa kenwere onwe, steeti kenjikọta nke Amerịka, ala nrọ.
It was a bitter defeat for billions all over the world.	Ọ bụ mmeri mwute nyere ijeri n' ụwa dum.
Almost immediately, President Trump's presidency was riddled in controversies, accusations, and scandals amidst a chaotic White House.	Ọ fọrọ ntakịrị ka ọ bụrụ ozugbo ka ịbụ onyeisi ala onyeisi ala Trump jupụtara na mgbagha, ebubo, na nkwụtọ n' etiti ọgbaghara dị na 'White House.'
One could say that ultimately Hillary Clinton may have had the last laugh after all.	Mmadụ nwere ike ikwu na n' ikpeazụ nwere ike bụrụ onye nwere agamniihu n' agbanyeghi ihe niile.
The White House Staff were either dismissed or they quit by themselves and replaced on a regular basis, even the press struggled to keep up with the changes.	Ndị ọrụ 'White House' ka a chụrụ n' ọrụ ma ọ bụ ha jiri aka ha kwụsị ọrụ a na-edochi ha kwa ụbọchị, ọbụnadị ndị nta akụkọ gbalịrị ịnagide mgbanwe a.
A massive scandal subsequently broke out alleging that Russia had meddled in the 2016 presidential election and the President took great pains to undermine the investigation.	Nnukwu nkwụtọ mesiri dapụta nke na-ekwu na Russia tinyere aka ná ntụli aka onyeisi ala nke 2016 nakwa na onyeisi ala gbara nnukwu mbọ igbochi nchọpụta a.
It posed a threat to national security and made a mockery of the American voting system.	Ọ bụ ihe egwu nyere nchekwa obodo ma mee usoro atụm votu nke Amerịka ihe ọchị.
The Russia scandal, the firing of James Comey (former FBI Director), resignation of Michael Flynn (former national adviser) and many more obstacles in his administration proved this to be the most troubled presidency in modern history.	Nkwụtọ nke Russia, ọchụchụ James Comey (Daịretọ FBI na mbụ), arụkwaghịm nke Michael Flynn (onye ndụmọdụ nke obodo na mbụ) na ọtụtụ ọgbatụhie ndị ọzọ n' ọchịchị ya gosiri na nke a kacha bụrụ onyeisi ala kacha nwe nsogbu n' akụkọ ihe mere eme ọgbara ọhụrụ.
All this was happening amidst a barrage of regular tweets from the President on his official account on social media, which most see as unbecoming and entirely inappropriate for a President in office.	Ihe a niile na-eme n' etiti ọtụtụ twiit nke si n' aka onyeisi ala kwa ụbọchị n' akaụntụ soshịa midia ya, nke ọtụtụ mmadụ na-ekwesịghị ekwesị n' ọ bụla n' onyeisi ala no.
The latest Ukraine scandal was triggered by President Trump's alleged efforts to coerce Ukraine and other countries to provide damaging information about the 2020 Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden.	'Nkwụtọ Ukraine nke ikpeazụ a ka e kwuru na ọ bụ mgbali nke onyeisi ala Trump ịmanye Ukraine na mba ndị ọzọ iweta ọmụma jọgburu onwe ya banyere onye ji 'Democratic Party' azọ ọkwa na 2020, Joe Biden kpalitere ya.
President Trump was said to have pressured his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, Attorney General, Bill Barr and other parties outside his administration to influence politics in Washington.	Onyeisi ala Trump ka e kwuru na ọ manyela ọkaiwu nke aka ya, Rudy Giuliani, Ọkaiwu izugbe, Bill Barr, and ndị ọzọ n' anọghị n' ọchịchị ya ka ha nwe mmetụta nye ndọrọndọrọ ọchịchị na Washington.
The 2016 Presidential election scandal also has not disappeared.	Nkwụtọ ntụli aka onyeisi ala nke 2016 apụbeghi.'
In the middle of September 2019, Trump's misuse of power to solicit foreign electoral intervention in the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign came into the full glare of the public because of a whistleblower statement made in August 2019.	N' etiti Septemba 2019, ejizighi ike ọchịchị nke Trump n' ịrịọ enyemaka mba ọzọ na achụmnta votu maka okwa onyeisi ala U.S. n' afo 2020 putara ihe n' ihi okwu o kwuru n' Ogostu 2019.
Then on 24 September 2019, the House of Representatives initiated a formal impeachment inquiry led by six House Committees and the House voted to approve guidelines for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry on 31 October 2019.	Mgbe ahụ na Septemba 2019, ụlọ nnọchiteanya bidoro amụma njupụta nchụtu nke ndị Kọmitii isi ụlọ nnọchiteanya nọ n' isi ya ebe ndị ụlọ nnọchiteanya tụrụ votu iji nabata ụkpụrụ ndụzi maka ogo njupụta nchụtu ọzọ n' Ọktoba 31, 2019.
To impeach President Trump, a majority is required in the House and for conviction or removal from office a two- thirds 'super majority' is required in the senate.	Iji chụtu onyeisi ala Trump, a chọrọ ọtụtụ n' ụlọ ọmebe iwu mana maka ịma ikpe ma ọ bụ mwepụ n' ọchịchị a chọrọ abụọ n' ụzọ atọ nke ọnụ ọgụgụ dị ukwuu n' ụlọ sineti.
The whole world waits and watches the outcome of the impeachment as they also wonder whether President Trump who could so aptly be described as the cat with nine lives (having emerged seemingly unscathed by each scandal) would survive the latest misconduct.	Ụwa niile na-eche ma na-ekiri ihe ga-abụ mpụtara nchụtụ a dị ka ha na-atụ anya ma onyeisi ala Trump onye a kọwara dịka onye nwere chi ọma doro anya (n' ihi enweghi ihe mmekpa ahụ na nkwụtọ ọ bụla) ga-enwere onwe ya n' agwa ọjọọ nke ikpeazụ a.
The question remains: Will this be Trump's triumph or trial? We only have a short while left to see as the political games in the United States continue to unravel.

In an exclusive interview with SaharaReporters shortly after his performance at the just concluded National Festival of Arts and Culture in Edo State, he said: 'We're in court already.

Walter's Wake-keep By Rudolf Ogoo Okonkwo	Nlafo chi Walter nke si n' aka Rudolph Ogoo Okonkwọ
Wakes of Nigerian-Americans who died in America is a different ball game.	Nlafo chi ndị Naịjirịa-Amerika nwụrụ n' Amerịka bụ ihe ọzọ.
Some consider that the more legitimate kind of wake.	Ụfọdụ were ya ka nọ for chi kwesiri ekwesi.
Friends and associates sympathize more and understand the need to raise money to support the family and in some cases, to transport the body back to Nigeria.	Ndị enyi na ndị mmekọrịta na-emekarị ebere ma ghọta mkpa ọdị ịnakọ ego iji kwado ezinaụlọ nakwa oge ụfọdụ, iji bunata ozu ahụ Naijiria.
In the Boston metropolitan area is a Liberian who loved to attend Nigerian parties.	N' okirikiri Boston mepere emepe e nwere onye Liberia nke hụrụ ịbịa pati ndị Naịjirịa n' anya.
(Let us call him Walter, because we have no permission to use his real name.)	(ka anyị kpọọ ya Walter, makana enwetabeghi ikike ịkpọ ezigbo aha ya.)
He loved Nigerian music, jollof rice, pepper soup, Shoki dance and watching Nigerians spray dollar bills like snow flakes at these parties.	Ọ hụrụ egwu Naijiria n' anya, osikapa jọlọf, pepe supu, egwu shoki na ikiri ndị Naịjirịa ka ha na-efe dọla ka mmiri na pati ndị a.
Trust Nigerians in America, they come up with every reason to throw a party - child dedication, wedding anniversary, birthday, graduation, send-off, wake-keep, etc.	Tụkwasị ndị Naịjirịa nọ n' Amerịka obi, ha na-enwe ihe ọ bụla ka ibe iji kpọọ pati - nkupụta nwa, ncheta agbamakwụkwọ, ncheta ọmụmụ, mpụta n' ụlọ akwụkwọ, isi mmadụ laa n' udo, nlafo chi, wee dịrị gawa.
Every party is special but none is as special as a wake-keep.	Particularly ọ bụla bụ ọpụrụ iche mana ọnweghi nke bụ ọpụrụ ka nlafo chi.
If you rent a hall to celebrate your 50th birthday or 25th wedding anniversary, or even your child's 5th birthday, or your child's dedication in church, the general feeling is that you have the money to spare.	Ọ bụrụ na igbazite nnukwu ụlọ iji rie oriri ncheta afọ ọmụmụ nke 50 ma ọ bụ ncheta agbamakwụkwọ nke 25, ma ọ bụ ọbụna ncheta ọmụmụ nke afọ 5 nwa gị, ma ọ bụ nkuputa nwa gị n' ụlọ ụka, mmetụta nke ọha bụ na i nwere ego ị ga-emefu.
People will still come, enjoy, and may even give you gifts, but it is mostly not seen as obligatory. 	Ndị mmadụ ka ga-abịa, ñụrịa, ma ọbụna nwe ike inye gị onyinye, mana anaghị ahụ ya na ka iwu.
But when it is a wake-keep, the party from conception to execution is aimed at raising money to assist the bereaved to go home and attend the funeral of the dead.	Mana mgbe ọ bụ nlafo chi ọnwụ mmadụ, ebumnuche pati ahụ site na ncheta ruo omume ya bụ ịtụkọta ego iji nyere onye nwụrụ anwụ aka ka o ruo ụlọ na ịga akwamozu onye nwụrụ anwụ.
The MC makes that clear every ten minutes of the event.	MC na-eme ka nke a doo anya kwa nkeji iri ọbụla nke mmeme ahụ.
And since people are expected to drop something,' organizers make sure that there are a lot of food and drinks to justify the things people will 'drop'.	Ka ọ bụ na a tụrụ anya na ndị ga-eweta ihe ' ndị nchịkọta na-ahụ na enwere ọtụtụ ihe oriri na ihe ọñụñụ kwesiri ihe ndị mmadụ ga-eweta.
Another feature of these wake-keep, other than the fact that most of those for whom the events are held had never been to America, is that there is an unwritten understanding between the organizers and the attendees that whatever the attendee gives is documented, noted and permanently preserved for the time when it would be necessary to return the favor.	Ihe ọzọ e ji mara nlafo chi, n' abụghị na ọtụtụ n' ime ndị e ji maka ha eme mmemme abịanubeghi Amerịka, bụ na enwere nghọta e deghị ede dị n' etiti ndị nchikọba na ndị na-abịa mmemme na e dere ihe ọ bụla onye bịara mmemme nyere n' akwụkwọ, hụwa ya ama ma chekwaba ya ebighị ebi maka mgbe ọ ga-adị mkpa ịkwụghachi ụgwọ amara a.
In Igbo community, they even have a proverb that backs it up.	N' ala Igbo, ha nwere ọbụna ilu ọ dabere na ya.
It says: whatever a man gives to another man is a loan waiting to be repaid.	Ọ na-asị: ihe nwoke nyere ibe ya bụ ego ọ ga-akwụ akwụ ka o binyere ya.
This last part accounts for the proliferation of wake-keep.	Akụkụ ikpeazụ a kọwara ihe kpatara mbawanye na nlafo chi.
It is like a form of isusu.	Ọ dị ka ịtụ akawo.
You wait for your turn to collect return on your investments.	Ihe inwere ime bụ ichere oge gị ịnara ego ị tinyere.
Those who had lost their parents before coming to America waste no time in holding wakes for their uncles and aunts, not minding whether they were close or not.	Ndị nne na nna ha nwụrụla tupu ha abiawa Amerịka anaghị egbu oge ọ bụla imere nwanne nna/nne ha nwoke ma ọ bụ nwaanyị nlafo chi, n' agbanyeghi ma ha adị nso ma ọ bụ na ha adịghị.
Some will roll out the wake-keep red carpet for their step-mothers and step-fathers, even if they never saw eye-to-eye in life.	Ụfọdụ ga-eme mmemme nlafo chi nwunye nna ha na di nne ha, ọbụnadị na ha adịghị n' udo mgbe ha nọ ndụ.
All that they needed to say was that their parents died when they were young and it was this uncle, this aunt, this step-father, this step-mother, even step-sister and step-brother that stepped in and raised them.	Ihe ha nwedebere ikwu bụ na ndị mụrụ ha nwụrụ ka ha pere mpe ma ọ bụ nwanne nne/nna nwoke a ma ọbụ nwaanyị a, dị nne a, nwunye nna a na nwanne nwoke a batara wee zụọ ha.
Who are you to argue with a grieving fellow?	Onye ka I bụ gị na onye mmadụ ya nwụrụ anwụ ịrụ ụka?
After all, the ever-increasing cost of burial at home means that no matter who dies, once the 3 am call comes, the demand for money follows.	E kwuwe ekwuwe, mmụba ọnụ akwamozu n' ụlọ pụtara na n' agbanyeghi onye nwụrụnụ, ozugbo ọkpụkpọ òkù elekere atọ nke ụtụtụ batara, ịna ego ga-esochi ya.
And having someone abroad means pressure to go for 'a befitting' oversea-higher-standard burial.	Inwe onye nọ obodo oyibo pụtara ịgbalị maka akwamozu bụ eji ama atụ n' obodo oyibo.
Wake-keep is so ubiquitous that people now simplify it by saying Peter's wake or Angela's wake, instead of properly labeling it as the wake of Peter's father or Angela's mother.	Nlafo chi dị ebe niile nke ndị mmadụ na-emezi ya ka ọ dị mfe site n' ikwu ihe dị ka nlafo chi Peter ma ọbụ nlafo chi Angela, kama inye aha kwesiri ya dị ka nlafo chi nna Peter ma ọ bụ nne Angela.
It saves everyone the headache of figuring out the real relationship.	Ọ na-ebelatara onye ọbụla isi ọwụwa ịchọpụta ihe jikọrọ onye na onye.
Once you are part of the wake-keep-going circus, it is expected that, sooner or later, you will get your own wake.	Ọ bụrụ na i so n' òtù ndị na-eje nlafo chi, a tụrụ anya n' aka gị na, na nso nso ma ọ bụ e mechaa, na ị ga-enwe nlafo chi nke gị.
One guy having difficulty completing his house in the village manufactured his own wake out of the death of his maternal grandmother.	Otu onye nwere ihe isi ike ịrụsị ụlọ ya n' ime obodo bọlitere nlafo chi nke ya site ọnwụ nne nne ya.
Recently, the expectation of going home for the funeral has been waived.	Na nso nso a, e wepula ibu n' obi ịna ụlọ maka akwamozu.
It is now acceptable that the person who collected all those money at the wake did not even go home for the funeral.	A na-anabatazị na onye ahụ nke nakọrọ ego niile a na nlafo chi ejeghi ụlọ ma ọlị maka ya bụ akwamozu.
That he or she presumably sent the money home is satisfactory.	Na ọ zigara ego ahụ n' ụlọ ka ha si eche juru afọ.
Wakes of Nigerian-Americans who died in America is a different ball game.	Nlafo chi ndị Naịjirịa-Amerịka nwụrụ na Amerịka bụ ihe dịrị onwe ya iche.
Some consider that the more legitimate kind of wake.	Ụfọdụ enwe ya ka nlafo chi ka dị nkwesi.
Friends and associates sympathize more and understand the need to raise money to support the family and in some cases, to transport the body back to Nigeria.	Ndị enyi na ndị mkpakọrịta na-emekarị ebere ma ghọta mkpa ọ dị ịtụkọ ego kwado ezinaụlọ nakwa oge ụfọdụ, ibuna ahụ onye ahụ Naịjirịa.
Though recently there has been the increasing grumble for Nigerian-Americans to obtain life insurance to cover transportation of their body home, if they so wish, and still leave something for those they left behind.	N' ezie na nso a e nwere mbawanye na ntamu banyere ndị Naịjirịa-Amerịka inweta inshọọransị maka ndụ ga-ahụ maka ibunata ahụ ụlọ, ha ọ masikarịa ha, ma hapụrụ ndị ha hapụrụ ihe.
Walter is a permanent fixture at these wakes.	Walter na-abịa nlafo chi ọbụla.
He drinks to his heart's desire, dances until his waist aches.	Ọ a-añụ mmanya ka ọchịchọ obi ya sịrị dị, gbagide egwu ganye n' ukwu afụwa ya ụfụ.
He once inquired about joining People's Club after he watched the display of the club members at some of these wakes, but he pulled back when told how much it costs to join the club.	N' otu oge ọ jụrụ maka ịbanye 'People's Club' ka o kirisiri ihe ngosi ụfọdụ n' ime ndi òtù a na nlafo chi ụfọdụ, mana ọ lara azụ ka a gwasịrị ya ego ole ọ na-eri iji wee sonye. 
Then, one day, Walter's mother died.	Otu ụbọchị, nne Walter nwụrụ.
And Walter had his wake.	Walter wee nwe nlafo chi nke ya.
He contacted his Nigerian friends who told him how to plan a wake.	Ọ kpọrọ ndị enyi ndị Naịjirịa ndị gwara ya ka e si akwado nlafo chi.
He did not have close friends to constitute his Committee of Friends so he became his own one-man Committee of Friends.	O nweghi ndị enyi ha na ya dị na mma ga-abụ Kọmitii ndị enyi ọ wee bụrụ Kọmitii otu nwoke nke onwe ya.
He did all the running-around and spent all the money needed for drinks, hall, DJ, photographer and food.	Ọ mere mgbagharị niile ma weta ego niile a chọrọ maka mmanya, nnukwu ụlọ, DJ, onye ose foto na nri.
On the day of the wake, Nigerians came in large numbers.	N' ụbọchị nlafo chi, ndị Naịjirịa bịara n' ìgwè.
They ate, drank, danced, and, went home.	Ha riri, ñụọ, gbaa egwu, ma laa ụlọ.
The morning after Walter's wake, he went to the office of a friend of mine who had given him $50.	N' ụtụ ka Walter mesiri nlafo chi, o jere n' ụlọ ọrụ otu eyi m onye nyere ya $50.
The average money given at these wakes is $100.	Ego a na-enyekarị na nlafo chi bụ $100.
Walter thanked my friend so profusely that my friend found it odd.	Walter kelere enyi m nwoke nke ọfụma nke enyi m nwoke hụrụ ya ka ihe ezighi ezi.
Something a phone call would have taken care of, Walter came in person.	Ihe ọkpụkpọ òkù ekwenti kaara ime, Walter bịara n' onwe ya.
When Walter left, my friend called around to find out why Walter was super appreciative.	Ka Walter pụrụ, enyi m bịara ka ọ mara ihe mere Walter ji nwe nnukwu afọ ojuju.
Could it be because someone who didn't know him very well gave him $50?	Ọ ga-abụ makana onye amaghị ya ọfụma nyere ya $50?
What my friend found out was that all those Nigerians who came, ate, drank, danced, and then went home, none gave Walter any money because he never gave any money at all those wakes he had attended over the years.	Ihe enyi m chọpụtara bụ na ndị Naịjirịa niile ahụ bịaranụ, riri, ñụọ, ma laa, onweghi onye nyere Walter ego ọbụla makana onweghi onye ọ nyere ego ma ncha na nlafo chi ahụ ọ jere afọ niile gara aga.

Experts want critical thinkers to lead, transform Nigeria.	Ndị ọkachamara chọrọ ka ndị nwere echiche nnyocha chịwa, gbanwee Naijiria.
Stakeholders who converged on the Nnamdi Azikiwe University (NAU) Awka, Anambra State have canvassed the emergence of critical thinkers in leadership positions with a view to transforming Nigeria.

They stated this during the Ninth World Philosophy Day of the United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) at the Department of Philosophy, Faculty of Arts, with the theme, 'Critical Thinking, Leadership and Social Transformation.	Ha kwuru nke a n' emume 'Ninth World Philosophy Day' nke 'United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) na ngalaba Philosophy nke ngalaba 'Arts, ' nke isiokwu ya bụ 'Critical Thinking, Leadership and Social Transformation'.
A former Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Rev. Fr. Professor Obi Oguejiofor noted that leaders are drawn to the led if they possess critical thinking, analytical, communicative, creative, open-minded and problem solving to lead and transform organisations or institutions socially and economically.	Onye bụbu onyeisi ngalaba nke Arts, Rev. Fr.

He lamented that the problems dogging Nigeria and Africa's developmental path stem from absence of leaders who could think critically from time to time, likening the failure of Nigerians to think critically in the clamour for power shift, which he said, does not produce the best leader who could give justice.	Ọ kwara arịrị na nsogbu na-esogbu mmepe Naijiria na Afrịka si n' enweghi ndị ndu ndị nwere ike iche echiche miri emi n' otu oge ma ọ bụ nke ọzọ, were ọdịda Naijiria na-atụnyere enweghị ike iche echiche miri emi n' iti mkpu ka e bugharịa ike ọchịchị, nke o kwuru, na ọ naghị eweta onye kasị mma nwere inye ikpe nkwụmọtọ.
Also, former Chair, Department of English and Speech, A & T State University, North Carolina, United States of America, Professor Chimalu Nwankwo lamented that Africans do not think critically hence their inability to think on their own, but rely on dictates of foreigners.

Another stakeholder, Professor A. U. Igwe wondered if Nigerians apply critical thinking in whatever they do just as he condemned leaders who choose to become egocentric rather than critical thinkers when occupy leadership positions.	Onye ọzọ ọ metụtara, Ọkammụta A. U.

Igwe, who is a Professor of History, at NAU, said there were few African leaders who were guided by critical thinking, particularly the former President of Burkina Faso, Thomas Sankara who he described as an ideal leader who employed critical thinking and rational application of force during his regime.	Igwe, onye bụ Ọkammụta nke Akụkọ ihe mere eme, na NAU, kwuru na e nwere ole na ole ndị ndu Afrịka ndị echiche miri emi duru, ọkasị onyeisi ala Burkina Faso na mbụ, Thomas Sankara onye ọ kọwara dị ka ezigbo onye ndu nke webatara echiche miri emi na itinye ikike n' ezi ọrụ mgbe ọ chịrị. 
He observed that the UNESCO knows the important role philosophy plays in leadership; hence the declaration of November 21 every year as World Philosophy Day, stressing that critical thinking propels leaders to better the lot of their people.	Ọ kwuru na UNESCO mara ọrụ dị oké mkpa nkà ọmụma (philosophy) na-arụ n' ọchịchị; ya mere ha ji kwupụta na Nọvemba 21 kwa afọ ọbụla Ụbọchị nkà Ọmụma Ụwa niile, na-ekwusi ike na echiche miri emi na-akpali tell ndị ndu ime ka ihe dịrị ndị nke ha mma.
On his part, Dr. Emmanuel Umezinwa of the Department of Music and the first Master Degree Graduate of Philosophy Department, said Western system of thinking has inadvertently made Africans to sharpen their intellect and give too much thought to thinking, adding that there is an 'overblown idea of thought.

The Nigeria Institute of Soil Science (NISS) has said it is ready to clampdown on unqualified and fake soil scientists in the country.	ụlọ ọrụ na-ahụ maka aja ala (NISS) nke Naịjirịa kwuru na ọ dịla njikere igbochi ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị ala na-ezughị ezu na nke adịgboroja na mba ahụ.
The institute said it had reached an advanced stage towards the planned prosecution of unqualified soil scientists.	ụlọ a kwuru na ya erutela ọkwa dị elu iji kwado ikpe nke ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị ala na-ezughi oke.
The Registrar, NISS, Professor Victor Chude, who made this known in Abuja at the induction ceremony of newly registered soil scientists, said the move became necessary following high level of quackery among soil scientists in the country.	Onye na-edebanye aha, NISS, ọkamụta Victor Chude, onye mere ka a mara nke a na Abuja na mmemme nke ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị ala ọhụrụ edebanyere, kwuru na nkwaghari a dị mkpa mgbe ọ dị elu maka ịlụ ọgụ dị n'etiti ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị na ala ahụ.

He said the NISS Act 2017 is to regulate the profession of soil science, the use and management of soil resources to maintain high soil quality for sustainable crop production.	O kwuru na atụmatụ NISS 2017 bụ ịhazi ọrụ nke sayensị ala, ojiji na ijikwa akụ iji nweta ogo ala dị elu maka ịmị mkpụrụ ọ bụla....
According to him, soil scientists play the same role as doctors do, and if the soil is not properly treated, it will not support the production of crops and it will not allow it produce good yield.	Dịka o si kwuo, ndị sayensị na-arụkwa otu ọrụ ahụ ndị dọkịta na-arụ, ọ bụrụ na agwọghị ala nke ọma, ọ gaghị akwado iwepụta ihe ọkụkụ, ọ gaghịkwa ekwe ka ọ mịa ezi mkpụrụ.
'With the induction of the soil scientists, there is going to be awareness created for people to know how we operate.	'Site n'iwepụta ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị ala, a ga-enwe nghọta banyere ndị mmadụ ịmata otú anyị si arụ ọrụ.

However, President of NISS and chairman of the Council, Professor Ayo Ogunkunle, said the negative impact of charlatans among soil scientists could affect millions of people for several years before detection.	Agbanyeghị, Onye isi oche nke NISS na onye isi oche kansụl, ọkamụta Ayo Ogunkunle, kwuru na mmetụta ọjọọ nke ndị ekwesighị ịnọ n'etiti ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị ala nwere ike imetụta ọtụtụ nde mmadụ ruo ọtụtụ afọ tupu achọpụta.
Prof Ogunkunle, who noted that the importance of the regulation of the standards qualification and skills of soil scientists could not be over-emphasised, said the soil resources of the nation must not be neglected or allowed to degrade.	Ọkamụta Ogunkunle, onye rịbara ama na mkpa ọ dị ịkwado ụkpụrụ ntozu ogo na nka nke ndị sayensi ala kwuru, ekwesighi ileghara akụ nke ala nke mba ahụ anya ma ọ bụ kwe ka ha mebie.
While noting that the detailed survey and mapping of Nigeria's soil resources are overdue, he the solicited support from the government in view of its importance.	Agbanyeghị na nyocha zuru ezu na nhazi nke ala Naịjirịa, ọ rịọrọ gọọmentị nkwado site na ya n'ihi mkpa ọ dị.
He said: 'Agricultural soil is the real wealth of a nation as it is basic to human existence, essential for food, feeds, fibres and fuel production.

However, the agency stated that the exercise would appear daunting in view of individual ownership of liquefied petroleum gas (cooking gas) cylinder in the country.	Agbanyeghị, ụlọ ọrụ ahụ kwuru na mmega ahụ ga-eyi ihe egwu n'ihi ikike mmadụ nwere na silinda mmanụ anwụrụ ọkụ na mba ahụ.
Director, Inspectorate and Compliance Directorate, SON, Obiora Manafa, stated that plans are underway to work with stakeholders in the industry to begin a requalification scheme which would put every used cylinder through a requalification exercise to ensure that a cylinder is not used beyond its expiration date.

Identifying some of the challenges likely to be faced by the programme, especially in relation to the replacement of cylinders after withdrawal, he stated that in a country where gas cylinders are owned by individuals, it would be difficult to carry out the scheme as its being done in other countries where cylinders are owned by marketers.	N'ịchọpụta ụfọdụ nsogbu ọ nwere ike ibute na mmemme ahụ, ọkachasị n'ihe metụtara nnọchi nke ndị na-agba silinda mgbe ọ kwụsịchara, mwepu ya, o kwuru na mba nke ebe ndị nwere gas nwere ndị mmadụ, ọ ga-esi ike ịme atụmatụ ahụ dịka nke a na-eme na obodo ndị ọzọ ebe ndị na-ere ahịa bụ ndị ndị na-ere silinda.
'In Nigeria, cylinders are owned by individuals but owned by marketers in other climes and once the cylinders are due for recertification, it is easy for withdrawal, but difficult to get these cylinders from individuals to do requalification.

'The only way it can work is if any consumer takes a cylinder to a filling plant to refill and the plant owner checks the cylinder and it is due for requalification, the plant owners should be given powers to seize the cylinder.	'Otu ụzọ ọ ga - esi rụọ ọrụ bụ ma ọ bụrụ na ndị ahịa ọ bụla jiri silinda gaa n'ebe ana ere gas iji mejupụta ya, onye nwe ụlọ ọrụ ahụ na-enyocha silinda ahụ a ga-enye ndị nwe ebe ana-enyocha ya ikike iweghara silinda ahụ.

Currently, over 93 per cent of Nigeria's oil production comes from the Niger Delta basin but the Federal Government had stated that there was a need to explore other sedimentary basins, including Bida, Gongola, Sokoto, Benue Trough, Anambra and Dahomey in an attempt to diversify the country's hydrocarbon resources.

With over 11 research papers and other presentation by industry players focusing on 'Nigeria's Frontier Basins: Vehicle for Reserve Growth through R&D', the stakeholders noted that exploring the frontier basins remain timely, considering that the relevance crude oil dwindles as the international communities shift from oil.

Speaking at the event, which was sponsored by the National Centre for Petroleum Research and Development (NCPRD), Energy Commission of Nigeria in collaboration with the NNPC, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency and the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi, Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mele Kyari, said there was need to intensify collaboration to achieve desired outcomes in the ongoing exploration activities in the frontier basins.

The increasing demand for mechanisation among an estimated 77 million farmer population as well as factors limiting better use of Nigeria's agricultural mechanisation potential underscore the importance of reviewing the agricultural mechanisation policy within the present drive to make Nigeria more self-sufficient in its food requirements.	ọrịa ndị ọrụ a na achọghị imezi ihe n'etiti ndị ọrụ ugbo no narị nde iri asaa na asaa na ihe ndị na egbochi ikwusi ọrụ ugbo nke Naịjirịa g'esi gosipụta ọdị nkpa ịtụgharị usoro ọrụ ugbo bụ ihe eji eme ugbua ka Naịjirịa zuo ezu na nri ya.
Some of these limiting factors reported by stakeholders are poor access to credit, high cost of agricultural equipment, minimal private sector engagement, weak advocacy and lack of a clear framework guiding implementation of the broad statements on agricultural mechanisation in the National Agriculture Promotion Policy.	ụfọdụ n'ime ihe ndi amachịpụtara na ndị nwere mmụta a enweghị ohere inweta otuto, oke ihe eji enyere ọrụ ugbo aka, ntinye aka ndi pere mpe n'otu aka, ubara adịghị ike na enweghi usoro doro anya na-eduzi mmejupụta n'ihe banyere ndị ọrụ ugbo n'usoro iwu ndị oru ugbo.
Developing an implementation plan for agricultural mechanisation in the National Agriculture Promotion Policy, introducing policy on compulsory in-country assembly of tractors and other agricultural machinery, developing federal policy on land development and offering financial incentives to states to develop farmlands, expanding the mechanisation policy to comprise irrigation infrastructure, land clearing and post-harvest storage activities, and extending the zero-tariffs policy to tipping trailers and agricultural machinery spare parts are some recommendations proffered by stakeholders to address these limitations.

Central Bank of Nigeria's (CBN) governor Godwin EmefieleA: Accidentally, the United States Central Bank – The Federal Reserve – stumbled on a powerful monetary policy tool in the 1920s.

After the First World War, the new regional Federal Reserve banks found they had almost no financial relationship with the banks they were supervising in their regions.	Mgbe Agha Mbụ gasịrị, ndị ụlọ ọrụ Federa Resav mpaghara ọhụrụ chọpụtara na ha enweghị ego na ụlọ akụ ha na-elekọta na mpaghara ha.

In a bid to find other ways of earning money, early in 1992, the Federal Reserve banks started buying government bonds from banks so they could at least earn some interest.	N'ịchọ ụzọ ndị ọzọ ha ga-esi nweta ego, na mbido 1992, ụlọ akụ Federa resav malitere ịzụ nkekọ gọọmentị site na ụlọ akụ ka ha wee nwee ike inweta ma ọ dịkarịa ala.
It soon discovered something interesting – as it bought the government securities from the banks, the banks reserves were boosted.	N'oge na-adịghị anya, ọ chọpụtara ihe na-atọ ụtọ - ebe ọ na-azụta nchekwa nke gọọmentị n'aka ụlọ akụ, na-eme ka nkwalite nke ndị nwe ụlọ akụ kwalite.
The second order effect of this was that interest rates started to come down as the banks all had more money to deploy.	ụzọ nke abụọ si mee nke a bụ na ọnụego ọmụrụ nwa bidoro gbadata ka ụlọ akụ niile nwekwuru ego iwebata.
Thus the Federal Reserve figured out that when credit was scarce and interest rates were high, it could buy up government securities from the banks to boost liquidity and lower those rates.	Federa resav si kọwaa na mgbe akwụmụgwọ dị ụkọ na ọmụrụ nwa dị elu, ọ nwere ike zụta nchekwa gọọmentị site na ụlọ akụ iji bulie oke mmiri na belata ọnụego ndị ahụ.
By extension the reverse was also true – when there was too much money in circulation and interest rates were too low, it could sell government securities to banks.	Site na ndọtị, mgbanwe a bụkwa eziokwu - mgbe enwere nnukwu ego na mgbasa ma na ọmụrụ nwa dị ntakịrị, ọ nwere ike renye nchedo gọọmentị n'ụlọ akụ.
By May 1922, the Federal Reserve decided to formalize this process and create what was called the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to coordinate how this new powerful tool was to be used and when.	Tupu Mee 1922, Federa resav kpebiri imepụta usoro a wee mepụta ihe akpọrọ Kọmitii ahịa mepere nke isi ala (FOMC) iji hazie otu a ga-esi rụọ ngwá ọrụ ọhụrụ a dị egwu na mgbe.
These days Open Market Operations (OMO) is nothing new of course but in 1922 one can only imagine how innovative they were.	mmepe ahịa nke ụbọchị ndị a (OMO) na-arụ ọrụ n'ahịa ọhụrụ (OMO) abụghị ihe ọhụụ mana ọ bụ na 1922 mmadụ nwere ike iche n'echiche etu ha si arụ ọrụ.
All of a sudden there was a market tool which could be used as a lever to control interest rates without having to use any other crude methods.	Na mberede, enwere ngwa ahịa nke enwere ike iji dị ka onye na-achịkwa iji belata ọnụego ọmụrụ nwa na-ejighị ụzọ ọjọọ ndị ọzọ.
Over the last 100 years since the invention of this tool, Central Banks across the world have borrowed and deployed it in their own countries to achieve the same goal of managing the supply of credit in the economy and interest rates in general.	N'ime otu narị afọ gara aga kemgbe mmalite nke ngwa a, ụlọ akụ ala n'ofe ụwa agbaziri ma bufee ya na mba nke ha iji nweta otu ebumnuche nke ijikwa kredit nke akụ na ụba na ọmụrụ nwa n'ozuzu ya.
Until the coming of the Great Godwin Emefiele, Nigeria's Central Bank governor, that is.	Ruo mgbe ọbịbịa onye dị ike Godwin Emefiele, gọvanọ ụlọ akụ nke ala Naịjirịa, bụ ya.
In the last 2 or so years in Nigeria, the meaning of OMO has been completely redefined.	N'ime afọ abụọ gara aga ma ọ bụ karịa na Naịjirịa, a kọwapụtara nkọwa nke OMO kpamkpam.
The name remains the same and in the Central Bank's annual activity report, it still says that the purpose of its OMO activity is 'to moderate the excess banking system liquidity'.	Aha a ka bụ otu ihe si kwa na akụkọ nke ụlọ akụ isi ala kwa ụbọchị, o ka na ekwu na ebumnuche nke ọrụ OMO bụ 'ime ka usoro ụlọ akụ dị nma'.
On the face of it, that sounds like the same thing the US Fed discovered almost 100 years ago.	N'akụkụ ya, nke ahụ na-ada ka otu ihe ahụ US Fed chọpụtara n'ihe dị ka otu narị afọ gara aga.
But when you dig deeper into what is going on in Nigeria, you see something totally different.	Mana mgbe imubanye n'ime ihe ndị na-eme na Naịjirịa, ị na-ahụ ihe dị iche.
The first thing is to ask a simple question – how come CBN's OMO involves foreign investors? Much of the securities being sold by the CBN to 'mop up' excess liquidity in the banking system is being bought by foreign investors.	Ihe mbu bu iju ajuju - kedu ihe CBN si OMO si tinye ndị nnochita ala ozo? Ọtụtụ ndị nchekwa nke ndị CBN na-ere iji 'dozie oke mmiri dị na usoro nchekwa ụlọ akụ na-azụta n'aka ndị si mba ofesi.
Has the CBN finished mopping up the liquidity in Nigeria that it is now mopping up foreign liquidity as well? As anyone who has been following events knows, what happens is that the CBN sells securities to foreign investors at 'mouthwatering rates' that they cannot obtain elsewhere.	Ndi CBN emechaala mmiri dị na ala Naịjirịa na - emeziwanye mmiri si mba ọzọ? Dị ka onye ọ bụla nke na-eme ihe omume maara, ihe na-eme bụ na CBN na-eresị ndị nchekwa ala ọzọ nchekwa ego na 'ọnụ ọnụ' ha enweghị ike inweta ebe ọzọ.
Since these foreign investors only have dollars and the CBN's securities are denominated in naira, the CBN takes their dollars and exchanges it to naira for them.	Ebe ọ bụ na ndị ọchụnta ego ndị a si mba ọzọ nwere naanị dollar na ego mkpuchi nke CBN na naira, CBN na-ewere dollar ha ma gbanwere ya nye naira maka ha.
At the same time, it gives them a cast iron guarantee that when they need their dollars back in 1 years' time, it will sell it to them at an agreed rate no matter what the actual rate at that time is.	N'otu oge ahụ, ọ na-ekwe ha nkwa nke ihe nkedo na mgbe ha chọrọ dọla ha n'ime afọ 1, ọ ga-erere ha ya na ọnụego ekwenyere na agbanyeghị etu ọnụego ahụ n'oge ahụ dị.
These investors then take their naira and buy securities from the CBN and count their interest for one year.	Ndị a na - etinye ego na - ewere naira ha ma zụta nchekwa site na CBN ma gụpụta mmasị ha otu afọ.
In 2018 alone, CBN sold a total of N22.4trn ($62bn) worth of OMO securities ostensibly to 'mop up' excess liquidity.	Na 2018 naanị, CBN rere ọnụego N22.4trn ($ 62bn) nke nchekwa ego OMO ka ọ ga - eme ka ọ 'wụfuo mmiri.
Anambra State before the advent of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) was marred by chaos, armed robbery attacks, kidnapping, threat to life and, property as well as looting of public funds.	Steeti Anambra tupu mmalite nke All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) bịara nwee ọgba aghara site na, mwakpo ndị oji egbe, nwantakịrị, egwu na ndụ, akụ na ịwe ụba nke ọha.
Was there really that much money sloshing around the Nigerian banking system that needed mopping up? At any rate, there was hardly any movement in interest rates during the year since the CBN itself needed to keep them high to keep attracting foreign investors to buy the securities.	Enwere nnukwu nsogbu ego na usoro ụlọ akụ na Naịjirịa chọrọ ịkwado? Ka o sina dị, enwebeghị mmegharị ọ bụla na ọnụego ọmụrụ nwa n'afọ ahụ n'ihi na CBN n'onwe ya kwesịrị idebe ha ka ọ dị elu iji nọgide na-adọta ndị na-etinye ego si mba ọzọ ịzụta nchekwa.
Herein is the final evidence that if the inventors of OMO were to reincarnate in Nigeria today, they would not recognise their own creation.	Nke a bụ akaebe ikpeazụ na-egosi na ọ bụrụ na ndị chepụtara OMO ga-alọ ụwa na Naịjirịa taa, ha agaghị anabata okike nke ha.
Nigeria's OMO does not mop up excess liquidity and does not have any effect on interest rates.	OMO nke Naịjirịa anaghị achịkwa oke mmiri ma ọ nweghị mmetụta ọ bụla na ọnụego ọmụrụ nwa.
So what is the best thing to call this redefined OMO? Nigeria owes the foreign investors who buy the OMO securities and it owes them in dollars.	Yabụ kedu ihe kacha mma ịkpọ OMO a akọwapụtara? Naijirịa ji ndị mbịarambịa si mba ọzọ ụgwọ zụrụ nchekwa OMO ma ji ya na dọla.
The CBN has merely found a way to increase Nigeria's external debt using what Diezani Alison-Madueke famously called 'non transparent opacity'.	CBN achọtala ụzọ iji bulie ụgwọ mpụga nke Naịjirịa site na iji Diezani Alison-Madueke a ma ama akpọrọ 'non transperent opesity'.
When you go to the Debt Management Office (DMO) website, what you see on the front page is FG's share of Nigeria's foreign debt that currently stands at $21bn.	Mgbe ị gara na webụsaịtị ụlọ ọrụ nhazi ụgwọ (DMO), ihe ị na-ahụ na peeji ihu bụ òkè FG nke ụgwọ mba ofesi na Naịjirịa nke dị ugbu a na $ 21bn.
As the CBN's OMO is mostly short term for 1 year, it is hard to tell how much the outstanding balance is.	Dịka OMO nke CBN na-abụkarị obere oge maka afọ 1, ọ bụ ihe siri ike ịkọ ego ole pụtara ìhè.
But whenever the CBN decides to make this figure public, we should be honest enough to treat it as what it really is by adding it to the figure of Nigeria's external debt.	Mana mgbe ọ bụla CBN kpebiri ime ka ọnụ ọgụgụ a pụta n'ihu ọha, anyị kwesịrị ịkwụwa aka ọtọ iji were ya dị ka ọ bụ n'ezie site na itinye ya na ọnụ ọgụgụ nke mpụga ụgwọ nke Naịjirịa.

What do you see in Nigeria's economy at the moment?.	Kedu ihe ị hụrụ na akụnụba Naịjiria ugbu a ?.
Well, based on our own business, it is a good time to be in Nigeria and the reason is that we are going through a transition period.	Ọ dị mma, dabere na azụmahịa anyị, ọ bụ oge dị mma ịnọ na Naịjirịa na ihe kpatara ya bụ na anyị na-agafe oge mgbanwe.

This will mean creating several other sources of income that people never know about.	Nke a ga - apụta ịmepụta ụzọ ọzọ esi enweta ihe mmadụ na - amaghị.
It is a good time to be in business because we are now helping people now to start making money from a source they never thought existed.	Ọ bụ oge dị mma iji nọrọ n'azụmahịa n'ihi na anyị na-enyere ndị mmadụ aka ugbu a ịmalite ịkpata ego n'ebe ha na-echeghị na ọ dị.
While I was in school, I didn't know anything called trading, though it was existing, but because at that time, there was no technology to bring it here.

Is the business related to foreign exchange trading?.	Azụmaahịa metụtara azụmahịa mgbanwe mba ọzọ?
That word foreign exchange (forex) is just one part of the market.	Mkpụrụ ego mba ọzọ gbanwere (forex) bụ naanị otu akụkụ nke ahịa ahụ.

For any young person, I see the business as a career.	Maka ndị na-eto eto ọ bụla, m na-ahụ azụmaahịa dịka ọrụ.

Without mincing words, technology now is the bedrock of businesses.	Na-enweghị okwu ntinye, teknọlọji bụzi nnukwu azụmahịa.

The suspension is imperative to prevent trading in the shares of the company beyond the effective date of the scheme of arrangement for Crown Flour Mills Limited to acquire the entire issued and fully paid ordinary shares of 50 kobo each in DFM held by scheme shareholders, subsequent to which the company would be delisted from the main board of the NSE	Nkwụsị ahụ dị oke mkpa iji gbochie azụmaahịa oke nke ụlọ ọrụ ahụ karịa ụbọchị dị mma maka atụmatụ maka nhazi nke ụlọ ọrụ ntụ ọka Crown iji nwete ego niile enyere na ịkwụ ụgwọ òkè zuru ezu nke kobo iri ise ọ bụla na DFM ndị haziri ya bụ ndị nwere òkè, nke ga-esote ya bụ ikewapụ ụlọ ọrụ ahụ na ndị isi nke NSE .

To paraphrase the historian, mathematician, journalist, Marxist, and progressive thinker, Edwin Madunagu, every political history has its significant dates, landmarks or turning points.	Iji kọwaa onye ọkọ akụkọ ihe mere eme, onye na-ahụ maka mgbakọ na mwepụ, odeakụkọ, Marxist na onye na-eche echiche ngamnihu, Edwin Madunagu, akụkọ ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị ọ bụla nwere ụbọchị ndị dị ịrịba ama, akara ala ma ọ bụ ntụgharị.
In Nigeria's political history, for instance, landmarks would include:	N'akụkọ ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị nke Naịjirịa, dịka ọmụmaatụ, akara ala ga-agụnye:
October 1, 1960 - The day Nigeria gained independence from Britain	Oktoba 1, 1960 - Ụbọchị Naịjirịa nwetere nwere onwe ha n'aka Britain
January 15, 1966 - When the first of what would become a tradition of military coups occurred	Jenuwarị 15, 1966 - Mbido nnara ọchịchị ndị agha

January 15, 1970 - The official end of the civil war .	Jenuwarị 15, 1970, - Mgbe agha obodo kwusiri .
On May 27, 50 years ago, Yakubu Gowon, who served as head of state of Nigeria from 1966 to 1975, perhaps in anticipation of the audacious move by the Military Governor of the Eastern Region of Nigeria, Lt. Col. Emeka Ojukwu, announced the division of Nigeria into 12 states from four regions.	Na Mee 27, afọ iri ise gara aga, Yakubu Gowon, onye chịrị dịka onye isi ala Naịjirịa site n'afọ 1966 ruo 1975, ikekwa n'atụ anya mmegharị ahu nke gọvanọ ndị agha mpaghara ọwụwa anyanwu nke Naịjirịa, Lt. Col. Emeka Ojukwu, kwuputara nkewa Naịjirịa n'ime steeti iri na abụọ na mpaghara anọ.
The division of Nigeria into 12 states and Ojukwu's declaration of Biafra were decisions that would change the country forever.	Nkewa Naịjirịa n'ime steeti iri na abụọ na nkwupụta Ojukwu maka Biafra bụ mkpebi ga-agbanwe mba ahụ ruo mgbe ebighi ebi. 
Gowon's action did not only alter the structure of Nigeria, it led to the reconstruction of the nascent nation through the lenses of the so-called Nigerian military; a military that was provincial in outlook as it was ill-equipped for leadership.	Omume Gowon agbanweghị naani ọdịdị Naịjirịa, ọ dabere na nruzigharị nke ala ahụ site na oghere ndị a kpọrọ ndị agha Naịjirịa, ndị agha bụ ndị lepuru anya mgbe ndị Naịjirịa enweghi ike idu onwe ha.
The military centralized economic and political power and moved Nigeria from a federal republic to a unitary state.	Ndị agha jịkọrọ ikike akụ na ụba na nke ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị ma mee ka Naịjirịa si na Federal Repọblik gaa na nchịkọ steeti ala.
In many ways, we can conveniently say May 27, 1967, was the day Nigeria began to unravel and any attempt to understand the current crises and our inability to make progress as a nation must necessarily return to the action of the military junta on May 27, 1967.	N'ọtụtụ ụzọ, anyị nwere ike ịsị na Mee 27, 1967 bụ ụbọchị Naịjirịa malitere ịkpughe onwe ya na mbọ ọ bụla iji ghọta nsogbu ndị dị oge ugbua na adịghị ike anyị inweta agamnihu dịka mba dị oke mkpa ilaghachị omume ndị ọchịagha na Mee 27, 1967.
Three days later, May 30, 1967, Lt. Col Ojukwu, a Nigerian soldier of Igbo extraction declared an 'independent sovereign state of the name and title of the Republic of Biafra .	Mgbe ụbọchị atọ gachara, May 30, 1967 Lt. Col. Ojukwu, onye agha Naịjirịa nke mpaghara ndị Igbo kwupụtara 'Nnwere onwe mba kwuru onwe ya akpọrọ Repọblik nke Biafra.
Officially excising the Eastern Region from Nigeria .	Ọ bụrụla ihe amaama na ekewapụtala mpaghara ọwụwa anyanwu na Naịjirịa.
Ojukwu based his action on the resolution, four days earlier, on May 26, 1967, of a joint conference of the Eastern consultative assembly and leaders of thought that asked him to declare the Eastern region as a separate republic at an 'early practicable date .	Ojukwu dabere ihe o mere na mkpebi, abali anọ gara aga na Mee 26, 1967 nke ọgbakọ nzukọ ndị isi mpaghara ọwụwa anyanwu na ndị isi nke gwara ya ka ọ kpọọ mpaghara ọwụwa anyanwu dịka mba ọzọ na mbido ụbọchị. 
The declaration of Biafra was the culmination of a series of tragic events .	Nkwupụta nke Biafra bụ ngwụcha nke ọtụtụ ọdachi.
First was the bloodletting that started with the January 15, 1966, military coup .	Nke mbụ bụ nkwafu ọbara nke bidoro na Jenụwarị 15, 1966, mgbagha ndị agha
That coup led to the assassination of Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Belewa, the country's first and only prime minister and Sir Ahmadu Bello, the Premier of the Northern Region, among other high-profile casualties .

Some recollections by Edwin Madunagu in 'Settling account with Biafra (The Guardian, May 4, 2000) are apposite here:	Ncheta ụfọdụ nke Edwin Madunagu na 'imezi akaụntụ nke Biafra' ( Guardian Mee 4, 2000) tughariri nke a :
One: the politics of the First Republic (1960-1965) was heavily characterized by ethnicity, especially towards the end of that tragic period .	Otu: ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị nke Republik nke mbụ (1960 - 1965) eji agbụrụ mara ya nke ukwuu, ọkachasị njedebe nke oge ọdachị.
Two: Of the five army majors that are more frequently mentioned as leading the coup attempt, only one, Major Adewale Ademoyega, was non-Igbo by ethnic origin .	Abụọ: n'ime ndị agha ise akpụ n'ọnụ na-edu nwapụ ndị agha, naanị otu onye agha bụ Adewale Ademoyega bụ onye na-abụghị onye si n'agbụrụ Igbo pụta.
Three: No Igbo political leader died and the only Igbo military casualty occurred not because he was a target but because he was considered a 'nuisance' .	Nke atọ: onweghi onye ndu ọchịchị ala Igbo nwụrụ na nanị ihe kpatara ogbugbu ndị agha Igbo abụghị n'ihi na ọ bụ onye Igbo, kama, ọ bụ n'ihi na e lere ya anya dịka nsogbu.
Four: The attempted coup was the culmination of a long period of political crisis in Nigeria . 	Anọ: Mgbagha ahụ bụ njedebe nke ogologo oge ọgbahara ndọrọ ndọrọ na Naịjirịa.
A crisis whose centre of gravity was Western Region where, before the military intervention, the crisis had become an armed popular uprising . 	Nsogbu nke ike ya si na mpaghara ọdịda anyanwu tupu ntinye aka ndị agha, nsogbu ahụ bụ ọgbaghara amaama eji alụ agha. 
On July 29, 1966, there was another military coup led by officers from Northern Nigeria and Lt. Col Yakubu Gowon became head of state.	Na Julai 29, 1966, enwere mbuso agha ọzọ nke ndị agha si n'mpaghara ugwu nke Naịjirịa duuru na Lt. Col. Yakubu Gowon bụ onye isi ala.
According to Madunagu, the coupists 'first made a move to pull the Northern Region out Nigeria, but when they were advised that they were now in a military situation to rule the whole country, instead of a part of it, they dropped the idea of secession and became champions of 'One Nigeria'.	Site n'akụkọ Magunagu, ndị a kpara ike a na mbu chọbuuru ikewa mpaghara ugwu na Naịjirịa, mana mgbe a duru ha ọdụ na ha bụzi ndị agha na achị mba niile kama ịchị so akụkụ nke ha, ha tufuru echiche ikewa obodo wee bụrụzie ndị agbachitere Otu Naịjirịa.
Lt. Col Ojukwu refused to recognize Lt. Col Gowon as head of state.'	Lt. Col. Ojukwu juru ịnabata Lt. Col. Gowon dịka onye isi ala.
The second coup led to the assassination, among other high-profile casualties, of the country's first military head of state, Gen. Aguiyi Ironsi, an Igbo, as well as the military governor of the Western Region, Lt. Col. Adekunle Fajuyi.	Nchịkwa nke abụọ butere ogbugbu ahụ, na ndị ọzọ nwụrụ bụ onye isi agha ala mbu, Gen. Aguiyi Ironsi, onye Igbo, yana onye ndu ndị agha mpaghara ọwụwa anyanwu, Lt. Col. Adekunle Fajuyi.
This was followed by, as Madunagu notes, 'mass killings not only in the North but all over the country, except the Eastern Region.	Nke a sochiri ka Madunagu kwuru, ' ogbugbu mmadụ abụghị naani na mpaghara ugwu kamakwa na mba niile, sọsọ mpaghara ọdịda anyanwu.
Now, multiply the May 1966 tragedy by a factor of 50, add to it the fact that the killings were now led by armed soldiers whose commanders were now in power and add to this the fact that the killings did not abate for at least five months and you begin to have an idea of what happened.'

The criminal indifference of the Nigerian state to the manifest pogrom against people from Eastern Nigeria, particularly Igbos, the repudiation by the Nigerian contingent (and the 'unilateral implementation' by the Eastern regional government) of the agreement on decentralization of power reached at a meeting in Aburi, Ghana, involving the main protagonists, Yakubu Gowon and Emeka Ojukwu, at the instance of Gen. Ankrah of Ghana, finally paved the road to Biafra.	Eleghị anya na mpụ nke steeti Naịjirịa na ihe pụtara ìhè megide ndị si ọwụwa anyanwu Naịjirịa, ọkachasị ndị Igbo, ndị nnọchị anya ndị Naịjirịa (na idi n'otu gọọmentị nke ndị mpaghara ọwụwa anyanwu mejupụtara) nke nkwekọrịta maka ikewa ike ọchịchị ekwekọrịta na nzukọ e enwere na Aburi, Ghana, nke gụnyere ndị isi, Yakubu Gowon na Emeka Ojukwu, na onye aka ebe Gen.

The accounts of what took place in those turbulent days are as varied as there are ethnic groups in Nigeria.	Ihe ndekọ ndị mere n'ụbọchị ọgbaghara ahụ dịgasị iche iche dịka esi nwee agbụrụ dị iche iche na Naịjirịa.
But one thing is certain: 	Mana otu ihe doro anya:
The effects of those events, particularly the actions of May 27 and 30, 1967, are still being felt today .	Nsonaazụ nke ihe omume ndị ahụ, ọkachasị na ihe omume Mee 27 na 30,1967 ka ana-ahụ ruo taa.
In one fell swoop, the military unilaterally restructured Nigeria according to its dictates.	N'otu ọsụsọ, ndị agha rụzigharịrị Naịjirịa dịka iwu ya siri dị.
While Ojukwu drafted 'unwilling' minorities in the Eastern Region to create a Biafran state where Igbos were in the majority, the Nigerian military which was nothing but the armed wing of a reactionary feudal class that had power thrust on it at independence began the implementation of an agenda of conquest.	Mgbe Ojukwu wepụtara ndị 'achọghị' obere agburu na mpaghara ọwụwa anyanwụ iji mepụta ala Biafra ebe ndị Igbo ka n'ọnụ ọgụgụ, ndị agha Naịjirịa nke abụghị ihe ọbụla karịa ogwe aka nke ndị agha na-akpata esemokwu nke ndị enyere ike ọchịchị nnwere onwe malitere mmejupụta atụmatụ nke mmeri. 
Interestingly, barely a year earlier, the section of the military that seized power after the January 15, 1966 coup had attempted to reconstruct Nigeria as a unitary state with the promulgation of the unification decree 34 of 1966.	N'ụzọ na-akpali mmasị, na-erughị otu afọ tupu mgbe ahụ, ngalaba nke ndị agha weghara ike mgbagha ahụ mere na Jenuwarị 15, 1966 nwughari iweghachi Naịjirịa dị ka ala jikọrọ ọnụ nke iwu nke njikọta 34 nke 1966 jikọrọ.
That attempt was opposed fiercely by those (including a section of the military) who felt they had lost out in the power equation. The rest is history.	Ndị gbahara atụmatụ ahụ bụ ndị (nke gunyere ngalaba ndị agha) chere na ha afụọla n'ike ọchịchị. Nke fọdụrụ ziri bụ akụkọ.

Unfortunately, Nigeria is on the cusp of that tragic history repeating itself.	Ọ bụ ihe nwute na Naịjirịa nọ na njedebe nke akụkọ ihe mere eme ahụ na-emegharị onwe ya.
Regrettably, 50 years after the declaration of Biafra many young Nigerians of Igbo descent are trying to recreate Biafra.	Ọ dị nwute na afọ iri ise gasịrị mgbe e kwupụtachara Biafra, ọtụtụ ndị ntorobịa ndị Naịjirịa sitere n'agburu Igbo na-anwa ime ka Biafra dịghachị mma.
In a few days, there will be events in Nigeria and around the world to mark the 50th anniversary of the declaration of Biafra on May 30, 1967.	N'ụbọchị ole na ole, a ga-enwe ihe omume na Naịjirịa na ụwa niile iji mee ncheta afọ iri ise e kwupụtara Biafra na Mee 30, 1967.
Forty-seven years after the end of the Nigeria-Biafra War, Biafra still resonates with individuals and groups within and outside the country; perhaps, a testament to the fact that the war hasn't ended in the minds of the protagonists and victims .	Afọ iri anọ na asaa ka agha obodo Naịjirịa-Biafra gwụsịrị, Biafra ka na-emegharị n'etiti ndị mmadu n'otu n'otu na ndị nọ ná mpụga; ikekwa, ọgbụgba akaebe nke eziokwu ahụ akwụsịbeghị n'uche ndị meriri na ndị emeriri.
The reality is that many of the issues that propelled the civil war are still with us today.	N'eziokwu, ọtụtụ ihe kpatara agha obodo ahụ ka dị ugbu a. 
So, how do we deal with this conundrum ?	Yabụ kedu out anyị ga-esi mee ihe nnọkọ ọnụ a ?
Is Biafra the solution ?	Biafra ọ bụ ọsịsa ya ?
In other words, can we solve the problems of 2017 Nigeria using the tragic solution of 50 years ago ?	N'aka nke ọzọ, anyị ga-edozinwu nsogbu nke 2017 Naịjirịa site na iji oke nsogbu nke afọ iri ise gara aga ?

Seventeen years ago, Edwin Madunagu, in the piece referenced above, admonished	Afọ iri na asaa gara aga, Edwin Madunagu na mpempe a kpọtụrụ aha n'ele dụrụ ọdụ
The young Nigerians now threatening to actualize Biafra (to) forget or shelve the plan.	Ụmụ Naịjirịa na-eyi egwu ugbu a na ha ga-eme ka Biafra bịa (na ha) chefuo ma ọ bụ kpachie atụmatụ ahụ.
In place of 'actualisation', they should, through research and study, reconstruct the Biafran story in its fullness and complexity and try to answer the unanswered questions and supply the missing links in the story.	Ha kwesiri iji ụzọ nchọpụta na agụmakwụkwọ degharịa akụkọ banyere Biafra n'uju ya na ihe dịkwa mgbagwoju anya ma gbalịa zaa ajụjụ a na-edeghị ma chọtakwa ihe na-apụtaghị n'akụkọ a .

You should at least understand what you want to actualise .	ịkwesiri ịghọta opekata mpe mata ihe ịchọrọ ime.
If 30 years after Biafra, you want to produce its second edition, you need to benefit from the criticism of the first.	Ọ bụrụ n'afọ iri atọ gafere, ịchọọ iwepụta mbịpụta ya nke abụọ, ịkwesiri irite uru site na nkatọ nke mbụ.

On the other hand, those who enjoy ridiculing Biafra—instead of studying it—are politically shortsighted.	N'aka nke ọzọ, ndị na-enwe mmasị ịkwa Biafra emo - kama ịmụ ya - anaghị elezi anya na ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị.

Madunagu's admonition needs no elaboration .	Ndụmọdụ Madunagu enweghị nkọwa.
It is clear enough for the young people pushing for the actualization of Biafra, many of whom were born after the end of the Biafra war 47 years ago .

The aspect of his position on Biafra that I want to focus on is the aspect that warns of the 'political shortsightedness of ridiculing Biafra' .

Balkanizing the nation	imebe isi ala nke mba
When the military regime headed by Gowon divided Nigeria into 12 states, it sought to weaken the prospect of the different groups in the Eastern Region uniting against the Nigerian state .	Mgbe ndị agha nke Gowon na-achị kewara Naịjirịa n'ime steeti iri abụọ, ọ chọrọ imebi atụmatụ nke ndị otu dị iche iche na mpaghara ọwụwa anyanwụ ijikọ aka megide Naịjirịa .
Of course, that action was music to the ears of minority groups, particularly those in the Eastern Region, who had long demanded their own state .	N'ezie, ihe ahụ emere dịka egwu na ntị ndị otu pere mpe, ọkachasị ndị nọ n'ọwụwa anyanwụ, ndị chọgoro steeti nke ha ogologo oge .
With the creation of states, however, the military not only unilaterally abrogated the geo-political structure that existed then, it went a step further to destroy the principle of federalism on which Nigeria gained independence in 1960 and which had sustained and kept the country together.	Site na okike nke steeti, ọbụghị naanị na ndị agha kagburu usoro ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị nke dị n'oge ahụ, ọ gara n'ihu mebie ụkpụrụ nke gọọmentị etiti nke Naịjirịa nke eji nwete nwere onwe na 1960 nke jigidere ma gbazie mba ọnụ .
We need to understand that this principle was adopted not only to assuage the fear of domination by a single group in the country but as recognition of the differences (multi-ethnic and multi-lingual) of the various 'ethnic nationalities' that were brought together to create Nigeria.	Anyị kwesịrị ịghọta na nnabata ụkpụrụ a abụghị naanị maka ụjọ otu òtù ịkagide ndị ọzọ na mba ahụ, kamakwa, dị ka mmata ndịiche (agbụrụ dị iche iche na ọtụtụ asụsụ) nke 'agbụrụ dị iche iche' a kpọkọtara ọnụ iji mebe Naịjirịa. 
Part of Gowon's broadcast on May 27, 1967, signaling the breakup of Nigeria into 12 states is pertinent here:	Ihe so n'akụkọ nke mgbasa ozi Gowon na Mee 27, 1967, na-egosi nkewa Naịjirịa n'ime steeti iri na abụọ bụ ihe dị oke mkpa ebe a:
The main obstacle to future stability in this country is the present structural imbalance in the Nigerian Federation .	Ihe mgbochi kacha njọ maka nkwụsị ike ọdịnihu na mba a bụ enweghị nhazi nke ugbu a na njịkọ mba. 
Even Decree No.8 or Confederation or 'loose association' will never survive if any one section of the country is in a position to hold the others to ransom.	Ọbụla iwu nke asatọ ma ọ bụ njịkọ ma ọ bụ 'mkpakọrịta na-adịghị ọcha' agaghị adị ndụ ma ọ bụrụ na mpaghara ọ bụla nke mba ahụ nwere ike ijide ndị ọzọ n'nkwe.
This is why the first item in the political and administrative program adopted by the Supreme Military Council last month is the creation of states for stability .	Ọ bụ ya mere ihe mbu dị na mmemme ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị na nhazi nke ọchịchị ndị agha nabatara n'ọnwa gara aga bụ ịmepụta steeti maka nkwụsị ike .
This must be done first so as to remove the fear of domination.	A ga-ebu ụzọ mee nke a iji wepu egwu nke nnara ike .
Representatives drawn from the new states will be more able to work out the future constitution for this country which can contain provisions to protect the powers of the states to the fullest extent desired by the Nigerian people.

As soon as these are established, a new revenue allocation commission consisting of international experts will be appointed to recommend an equitable formula for revenue allocation taking into account the desires of the states .

I propose to act faithfully within the political and administrative program adopted by the Supreme Military Council and published last month.	A na m atụ alo ijiri ntụkwasị obi rụọ ọrụ na ihe omume ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị na nchịkwa nke nzụkọ ọchịchị ndị agha nabatara ma bipụta n'ọnwa gara aga.
The world will recognize in these proposals our desire for justice and fair play for all sections of this country and to accommodate all genuine aspirations of the diverse people of this great country.

I have ordered the re-imposition of the economic measures designed to safeguard federal interests until such time as the Eastern Military Governor abrogates his illegal edicts on revenue collection and the administration of the federal statutory corporations based in the East.

The country has a long history of well-articulated demands for states .	Mba a nwere ogologo akụkọ ihe mere eme maka ndị chọrọ steeti .
The fears of minorities were explained in great detail and set out in the report of the Willink Commission appointed by the British in 1958 .	A kọwara nke ọma ihe ịtụ egwu nke ndị mpaghara pere mpe ma wepụta na akụkọ nke akwụkwọ akụkọ Willink nke ndị Britain họpụtara n'afọ 1958 .

Resolutions have been adopted demanding the creation of states in the North and in Lagos .	Emeela mkpebi maka ịmepụta steeti na mpaghara Ugwu na Legos.
Petitions from minority areas in the East which have been subjected to violent intimidation by the Eastern Military Government have been publicized .	A kọsara arịrịọ ndị mpaghara pere mpe na ọwụwa anyanwụ maka ịmepụta steeti nke gọọmentị ndị agha ọwụwa anyanwụ na-eyi egwu .
While the present circumstances regrettably do not allow for consultations through plebiscites, I am satisfied that the creation of new states as the only possible basis for stability and equality is the overwhelming desire of the vast majority of Nigerians .	N'agbanyeghị ọnọdụ ndị dị ugbu a na-akwa ụta na ha ekweghị ka a jụọ ajụjụ site na arịrịọ, enwere m afọ ojuju na ịmepụta steeti ọhụrụ dịka naanị ihe ndabere maka nkwụsị ike na nhatanha bụ nnukwu ọchịchọ nke ọtụtụ ndị Naịjirịa .
To ensure justice, these states are being created simultaneously .	Iji hụ n'ikpe ziri ezi, a na-ekepụta steeti ndị a n'otu oge .
To this end, therefore, I am promulgating a decree which will divide the Federal Republic into 12 states .	N'ihi nke a, ana m ekwupụta iwu ga-ekewa obodo niile na steeti iri abụọ .
The 12 states will be six in the present Northern Region, three in the present Eastern Region, the Mid-Western will remain as it is, the Colony Province of the Western Region and Lagos will form a new Lagos State and the Western Region will otherwise remain as it is .	Steeti iri na abụọ ahụ ga-adị isii na mpaghara Ugwu nke ugbu a, atọ dị na mpaghara ọwụwa anyanwụ ugbu a, mpaghara nke etiti ga-adị ka ọ dị ugbu a, mpaghara ogbè ndị ọdịda anyanwụ na Legos ga-emepụta steeti Legos ọhụrụ na mpaghara ọdịda anyanwụ ga-anọrọ otu ọ dị.
What the military regime of Gowon gave with one hand it took with the other .	Ihe ndị agha ọchịchị Gowon nyere n'otu aka, o were ya n'aka nke ọzọ .
And that would become the hallmark of subsequent military regimes in Nigeria .	Nke ahụ ga-abụkwa ihe eji amara ọchịchị ndị agha na-achị na Naịjirịa .
Gowon failed to realize, or deliberately ignored the reality that the issue wasn't the division of the country but the reluctance or inability of the military to keep its promise	Gowon amataghị, ma ọ bụ ọ kpachara anya leghaara eziokwu ahụ anya na okwu ahụ abụghị nkewa nke obodo mana enweghị mmasị ma ọ bụ enweghị ike nke ndị agha iji mezuo nkwa ya
This must be done first so as to remove the fear of domination .	A ga-ebu ụzọ mee nke a iji wepu egwu nke mkpagbu .
Representatives drawn from the new states will be more able to work out the future constitution for this country which can contain provisions to protect the powers of the states to the fullest extent desired by the Nigerian people .	Ndị nnọchị anya si na steeti ndị ọhụrụ ga-enwe ike ịmebe iwu obodo n'ọdịnihu nke nwere ike ịnwe ihe iji chebe ikike nke steeti ruo n'okè ndị Naịjirịa chọrọ .
Unfortunately, that never happened .	Ọ dị nwute, nke ahụ emeghị .
It couldn't have, considering the rapacious and parasitic nature of the Nigerian military so-called and the interest it represented and still represents .	O nweghị ike ịme, na-atule ụdị mmadụ ndị agha Naịjirịa bụ na mmasị ọ nọchịrị anya ma ka na-anọchị anya ya .
Once the military couldn't deliver on that promise, it also meant that the second part of its declaration that:	Ozugbo ndị agha enweghị ike imejupụta nkwa ahụ, ọ pụtakwara na akụkụ nke abụọ nke nkwupụta ya na: 
'The world will recognise in these proposals our desire for justice and fair play for all sections of this country' and	'Ụwa ga-amata site n'usoro ndị a na ọchịchọ anyị bụ maka ikpe ziri ezi na egwuregwu ziri ezi maka ngalaba niile nke mba a' na
'To accommodate all genuine aspirations of the diverse people of this great country,' was nothing but meaningless soundbite by a rampaging military sub-class in desperate search for legitimacy.	'Ịnabata ebumnuche dị mma niile nke ndị dị iche iche nke nnukwu obodo a' abụghị ihe efu ma oli nke na-enweghị isi site na ndị agha na-ebuso agha n'ịchọsị i ike iwu.
Since then, there has neither been 'justice nor fair play for all sections' of Nigeria.	Kemgbe ahụ, enwebeghị 'ikpe ziri ezi ma ọ bụ egwuregwu ziri ezi nyere mpaghara niile' nke Naịjirịa.
There hasn't been any serious attempt to 'accommodate all genuine aspirations of the diverse people of this great country .	Enwebeghị mgbalị siri ike iji 'nabata ebumnuche niile dị mma nke ndị dị iche iche nke nnukwu mba a' .
The sham of a federation that the military created has evolved into a Frankenstein's monster. Fast forward 50 years.	Ihe ihere nyere mba nke otu ndị agha mebere abanyela na nnukwu anụ Frankenstein. Ngwa ngwa n'ihu afọ iri ise .
Cleary, it is the nebulous federal government that is holding the country to ransom. The moment the military government took economic powers from the states, there was no way we could ensure justice and fair play.	N'ụzọ doro anya, ọ bụ gọọmentị etiti na-ejide mba a n'mgbapụta .
And once you can't ensure justice and fair play, there is no way you can stop the concomitant disquiet.	Ozugbo oge ndị ọchịchị weghara ikike akụ na ụba nke steeti, ọ nweghị ụzọ anyị ga-esi hụ na ekpere ikpe ziri ezi na egwuregwu ziri ezi, ọ nweghị ụzọ ị ga-esi kwụsị ọgbahara .
The politics of state creation	Ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị nke okike steeti
When Gen Murtala Muhammed created additional seven states—three in the 'South' and four in the 'North'—bringing the total to 19 states, and a new federal capital territory, Abuja, on February 3, 1976, ten days before his assassination on February 13, he left no one in doubt that the conquest was real.	Mgbe Gen. Muhammed mepụtara steeti asaa ọzọ - atọ na mpaghara ọdịda na anọ na mpaghara Ugwu- na-enweta mkpọkọta nke steeti ruo iri na itoolu, yana ogbè ọhụrụ gọọmentị etiti, Abuja na Febuwarị 3, 1976, ụbọchị iri tupu egbuo ya na Febuwarị 13, enyeghị onye ọbụla obi abụọ na mmeri a dị.
While Gowon showed an inclination to balance Nigeria geo-politically, Muhammed ensured that the 'North' had ten states while the 'South' had nine .	Oge Gowon gosipụtara na ọ nwere ike imezu nhazi usoro ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị Naịjirịa, Muhammed gbara mbọ hu na mpaghara Ugwu nwere steeti iri ebe mpaghara ọdịda nwere itoolu.
It has been alleged that the decision was to create four new states in the 'North' and four new states in the 'South', but when Muhammed announced the creation of states, instead of creating two states (Cross River and Akwa Ibom States) out of the old South-Eastern State, he simply announced the transformation of South-Eastern State into Cross River State.	Ekwuru na mkpebi ahụ bụ ịmepụta steeti ọhụrụ anọ na mpaghara Ugwu na steeti ọhụrụ anọ na ọdịda, mana mgbe Muhammed kwupụtara okike steeti, kama ịmepụta steeti abụọ, (steeti Cross River na Akwa Ibom) site na nke ochie ọdịda anyanwụ nke steeti ọwụwa anyanwụ, ọ kpọrọ mgbanwe nke ọdịda anyanwụ nke steeti ọwụwa anyanwụ gaa steeti Cross River.
Subsequent military regimes continued the conquest, not just on the political front, but on the economic front as well .	Usọrọ ọchịchị ndị sochirinu gara n'ihu na-emeri, ọ bụghị naanị n'ihu ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị, kamakwa n'ihu akụ na ụba.
Ten years later, in 1986, when the self-professed evil genius, Gen Ibrahim Babangida, set up a Political Bureau to review the country's political and democratic system, one of its recommendations was the creation of an additional state (Akwa Ibom State) in 'South' to create a geo-political balance of ten states each between the 'North' and 'South' .	Afọ iri ka nke ahụ gasịrị,na 1986, mgbe onye kwupụtara onwe ya ka ọkachamara maka ajọ ihe, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, guzobere ụlọ ọrụ ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị iji nyochaa ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị na ọchịchị onye kwuo uche nke obodo, otu n'ime ndụmọdụ ya bụ ịmepụta steeti ọzọ (Akwa Ibom) na mpaghara ọdịda anyanwụ iji mepụta ndozi ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị nke steeti iri ọbụla n'etiti mpaghara Ugwu na ndida .
Babangida spurned that recommendation .	Babangida jụrụ ịkwado ndụmọdụ ahụ .
He did create Akwa Ibom State, but he added another state (Katsina State) in the 'North' to maintain the imbalance .	O mepụtara steeti Akwa Ibom mana o mepụtarakwara steeti ọzọ (Katsina steeti) na Ugwu iji nọgịde na-adighị n'otu .
It was the same pattern that was adopted in subsequent state creation in 1991 (under Gen Babangida) and 1996 (under Gen Sani Abacha) .	Ọ bụ otu ukporo ahụ ka atọrọ na mmepụta steeti na-esote na 1991 (n'okpuru Gen. Babangida) na 1996 (n'okpuru Gen. Sani Abacha).
Geo-politically, today, Nigeria is composed of 36 states: 19 states in the 'North' and 17 states in the 'South' .	Na ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị, taa, Naịjirịa nwere steeti iri atọ na isii: Steeti iri na itoolu si na mpaghara Ugwu ebe steeti iri na asaa si na mpaghara ndida . 
Ordinarily, this should not matter .	N'ihe ịga n'anya ya, nke a ekwesịghị ịdị mkpa .
After all, in a federation, the federating units (states) are supposed to manage their affairs substantially and contribute to the sustenance of the Federation.	N'ihe niile, na ngalaba, gọọmentị etiti, ngalaba ndị a na-achị (steeti) kwesịrị ijikwa ihe omume ha nke ọma ma na-enye aka na nkwalite nke gọọmentị .
Therefore, only those who feel their states can sustain themselves would clamor for the creation of such states .	Ya mere, ọ bụ naanị ndị chere na steeti ha nwere ike ịkwagide onwe ha ga-ekwupụta maka ịmepụta steeti ndị a .
Of course, more self-sustaining states would mean more opportunities for the national government to benefit from the exploration and exploitation of resources in every state.	N'ezie, steeti ndị ga-ejigidenwu onwe ha ga-enwekwu ohere maka gọọmentị mba iji rite uru na nrigbu na nrigbu akụrụngwa na steeti ọ bụla .
Unfortunately, that is not the case with Nigeria.	Ọ bụ ihe nwute na osighị otua dịrị na Naịjirịa .
In a country where the military had hijacked and centralized the control of economic resources and political power by, for example, arrogating to itself the authority to create local governments as well as placing itself in the position of chief dispenser of funds based on its own criteria, including population, land mass, number of local governments, derivation principle, etc.	N'obodo ebe ndị agha weghaara ma tinye isi na ikike nchịkwa akụ na ụba na ike ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị site, n'ọmụmatụ, inye onwe ya ikike imepụta ọchịchị gọọmentị ime obodo yana itinye onwe ya n'ọnọdụ onye isi na-ekesa ego site na njirisi nke ya, gụnyere ọnụ ọgụgụ nke gọọmentị mpaghara inweta ụkpụrụ, ọnụ ọgụgụ nke ọchịchị ime obodo dgz.
The dog eat dog demand for states was inevitable.	A kwusinwughị usoro nkịta riri nkịta chọrọ steeti.
Thanks to the military—the armed wing of Nigeria's dominant power bloc—Nigeria has a weird federation where states can't create their own local governments; where local governments are listed in constitutions that have been nothing but military decrees writ large.	Ekele dịrị ndị agha- ogwe aka ike nke Naịjirịa- Naịjirịa nwere ọgbakọ ọchịchị dị egwu ebe steeti enweghị ike ịmepụta gọọmentị ime obodo; ebe edepụtara ọchịchị ime obodo na usoro iwu ndị agha na enweghị ihe ọzọ na-abụghị iwu ndị agha.
Thanks to the military, Nigeria has spurned justice and fair play and disregarded the genuine aspirations of the diverse people of this great country.	Ekele dịrị ndị agha, Naịjirịa emebiela ikpe ziri ezi na egwuregwu ziri ezi ma leghaara ezi ebumnuche nke ndị dị iche iche nke nnukwu obodo a anya.
It is not for nothing that Nigeria is described as a federal republic.	Ọ bụghị n'efu ka a kọwara Naịjirịa dịka otu obodo .
It was a choice made by the three regions in Nigeria preceding independence.	Ọ bụ mmasị nke mpaghara atọ ndị dị na Naịjirịa mere tupu nnwere onwe .
Both the Eastern and Western regions obtained internal self-government (independence) in 1957, while the North got same in 1959.	Mpaghara ọwụwa na ọdịda anyanwụ nwetara ọchịchị nke ịchị onwe ha (nnwere onwe) na 1957, ebe mpaghara Ugwu nwetara na 1959 .
Each region could have opted to go its own way in 1960.	Mpaghara ọbụla gaara ahọrọ ịga n'ụzọ nke aka ha na 1960 .
We could have had three countries as opposed to one at independence.	Anyị kaara inwe mba atọ na-abụghị otu na mgbe nnwere onwe .
The decision by the regions to be part of a shared territory called Nigeria came with some obligation and expectation.	Mkpebi mpaghara ịbụ akụkụ nke ala a na-akpọ Naịjirịa biara na ụfọdụ oke na ọrụ .
There is little to suggest that the federating region were willing to jettison the greater part of their economic and political independence for the sake of 'one Nigeria' .

In 1963, the regions (the precursor of our current states) controlled 50 percent of the revenues accruing from their region	N'afọ 1963, (ihe anyị na-elebara anya na steeti anyị ugbu a) na-achịkwa pesent iri ise nke ego ha na-enweta site n'obodo ha
Today we are quibbling whether the states have right to as little as 13 percent.	Taa anyị na-ajụ ma steeti o nwere ikike ọbụladị pesent iri na atọ .

Biafra of the mind vs Biafra of the field	Biafra nke uche na Biafra nke ubi
What is Biafra ?	Gịnị bụ Biafra ?
If that question was tough to answer in 1967, it is even more difficult today, fifty years after .	Ọ bụrụ na ajụjụ a siri ike ịza na 1967, ọ ka sie ike taa, afọ iri ise ka nke ahụ gasịrị .
As a nation, Biafra was going to be difficult to sustain even if it had been actualized .	Dị ka otu mba, Biafra ga-esi ike ịnagide ọ bụrụgodị na e keputara ya .
Was Biafra a nation made up of ethnic nationalities ?	Ndị Biafra ha buru mba mejupụtara agbụrụ ha?
In other words, was Biafra a microcosm of Nigeria ?	N'aka nke ọzọ, Biafra ọ bụ obere Naịjirịa ?
One of the things those who are agitating for Biafra have not been able to define or communicate effectively is an answer to the question: What is Biafra ?	Otu n'ime ihe ndị ahụ na achọ Biafra enwebeghị ike ịkọwa ma ọ bụ ikwukọrịta okwu nke ọma bụ azịza nye ajụjụ a : Gịnị bụ Biafra ?
The answers to this question are as varied as there are agitators .	Azịza ajụjụ a dị iche iche dị ka ndị na-achọ ya.
There are those who will tell you that Biafra encompasses the area that used to be the Eastern Region of Nigeria and beyond, including parts of Southern Cameroon and stretching to Equatorial Guinea and Gabon.	Enwere ndị ga-agwa gị na Biafra gụnyere mpaghara ahụ bụbu mpaghara ọdịda anyanwu nke Naịjirịa na gafere, gụnyere akụkụ ụfọdụ nke Saut Cameroon wee ruo Equatorial Guinea na Gabon .
Some define Biafra as simply the former Eastern Region of Nigeria that was given the name Biafra on May 30, 1967.	Ụfọdụ kọwara Biafra dịka nanị mpaghara izizi nke ọdịda anyanwu nke Naịjirịa nke enyere aha ya bụ Biafra na Mee 30, 1967.
Some say it is the five states (Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo) in south-east Nigeria where the Igbos are the major ethnic group .	Ụfọdụ kwuru na ọ bụ steeti ise ( Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu na Imo) na south-east nke Naịjirịa ebe ndị Igbo bụ ndị kacha na agbụrụ. 
Yet, others define Biafra as encompassing all the Igbo-speaking areas of southern Nigeria, including parts of present-day Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Benue States. 	Agbanyeghị, ndị ọzọ kọwara na Biafra gụnyere mpaghara niile na-asụ asụsụ Igbo mpaghara ndịda nke Naịjirịa, gụnyere Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Akea Ibom, gafere osimiri na steeti Benue.
The issue of definition is important because the lack of understanding and agreement can pose great problems .	Okwu banyere nkọwa dị mkpa n'ihi enweghị nghọta na nkwekọrịta nwere ike ibute nnukwu nsogbu.
Of course, up until May 30, 1967, there was nothing like Biafra as nation or political territory. 	Dịka ruo ọnwa Mee 30, 1967, o nweghi ihe dịka Biafra dịka obodo ma ọ bụ mpaghara ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị .
The only thing that bore the tag Biafra was a bight off the West African coast, in the easternmost part of the Gulf of Guinea, stretching to Cape Lopez in Gabon, over which Britain established a colonial protectorate in 1849.	Naanị ihe gosipụtara Biafra bụ ebe mpụtara dị n'akụkụ ọdịda anyanwụ nke Africa, n'akụkụ ebe ọwụwa anyanwụ nke Guinea, na-eru Cape Lopez dị na Gabon, ebe ndị bekee guzobere ikike nchịkwa na 1849. 
Biafra as a nation was a child of circumstance that would become a child of necessity.	Biafra dịka mba bụ nwa amụrụ ka ihe si dị nke ga-abụzị nwa dị mkpa e kwesiri ịmụ.

If the 'January 15 boys' had completed their 'project' either by one of them becoming head of state or as some have alluded, released the imprisoned leader of the national opposition, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, and installed him as prime minister;	Ọ bụrụ na ụmụ nwoke nke ọnwa Janụwarị 15, rụchara ọrụ ha site na otu onye ibu onye ndu ma ọ bụ dịka ụfọdụ si chee, ị kpọpụta onye isi ndị otu na emegide ndị ọchịchị bụ Obafemi Awolowo na ngha ka ọ bụrụ onye isi,

Questions Amaechi Should Answer On Transportation University By Olabisi Deji-Folutile	Ajụjụ Amaechi Kwesịrị ịza gbasara ụgbọ njem mahadum Site na Olabisi Deji-Folutile
Honestly, Nigeria should concentrate on building its research capacity and developing innovative curricula that will help its students develop the crucial skills of creativity and critical thinking.	N'ezie, Naịjirịa kwesiri itinye uche na iwulite ikike nyocha ya na iwulite usoro mmụta ga-enyere ụmụ akwụkwọ ya aka ịzụlite ikike dị mkpa nke okike na echiche siri ike.
These are some of the things that can make Nigeria relevant in the development space.	Ihe ndị a bụ ụfọdụ n'ime ihe nwere ike ime ka Naịjirịa nwee ohere na mmepe obodo.
I never believed Nigeria was serious about starting a Transportation University until Monday when President Muhammadu Buhari and other government officials commissioned the project in Daura, the President's home town.	Ekweteghị m na Naịjirịa kpọrọ ịmalite Mahadum ụgbọ njem ihe ruo ụbọchị Mọnde mgbe Onye isi ala bụ Muhammadu Buhari na ndị ọrụ gọọmentị ndị ọzọ mepere ọrụ ahụ na Daura, obodo nke Onye isi ala. 
The university, according to Transportation Minister, Mr Rotimi Amaechi, is a response to the question of how Nigeria would maintain and manage its railway infrastructure.	Mahadum ahụ, ka mịnịsta ụgbọ njem, Mazị Rotimi Amaechi si kwuo, bụ azịza nye ajụjụ ahụ banyere etu Naịjirịa ga-esi lekọta ma jikwaa akụrụngwa okporo ụzọ ya.
The reason given notwithstanding, the whole gamut of excitement that characterized the groundbreaking ceremony, suggests something else.	N'agbanyeghị ihe kpatara ya, obi ụtọ niile nke emume a, na-egosi ihe ozo.
Going by the way the minister resorted to insults and vituperation on Nigerians that dared to query the rationale for establishing the university in the President's home town;	Otu mịnịsta ahụ jiri mkparịa ndị Naịjirịa juru maka ebumnuche iguzo mahadum n'obodo nke Onye isi ala;
It appears the project was borne out of political contingency than any other reason.	Ọ dị ka ebumnuche nke ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị karịrị ihe ọzọ ọ bụla .
Besides, Amaechi stole the show at the ceremony that ordinarily should have been organised by the ministry of education and the National Universities Commission in conjunction with the Transportation ministry	Agbanyeghị, Amaechi weere ụbọchị ahụ nke kwesịrị isite na ngalaba agụmakwụkwọ na ụlọ ọrụ n'ahụ maka ọchịchị Mahadum ma gbaziri ụlọ ọrụ na ahụ maka ụgbọ njem .
From the minister's excitement, it is as if the transportation university is the best thing that has ever happened to Nigeria in recent times.	Site na mkparịta ụka obi ụtọ nke onye ozi, ọ dị ka a ga - asị na mahadum njem ahụ bụ ihe kachasị mma nke emetụla na Naịjirịa n'oge ndị na - adịbeghị anya .
He boasted about how he forced the China Civil Engineering Construction Company to undertake the project by refusing to sign the contract for Lagos-Ibadan Rail project and how he also forced the company to take some Nigerians to China for training in railway technology .	O turu ọnụ banyere etu o siri mee ka ụlọ ọrụ na akụ igwè nke China wee rụọ ọrụ a site na ịhapụ ịbịanye aka na nkwekọrịta maka iwu ụzọ tren Legos / Ibadan na otu o si manye ụlọ ọrụ ahụ ịkpọrọ ụfọdụ ndị Naịjirịa gaa mba China maka ọzụzụ gbasara iwu okporo ụzọ .
The Director of Rail Services of the Federal Ministry of Transportation, Mohammed Babakobi, didn't help matter, as he too, was more concerned about why the university must be in the President's town.	Onye isi n'ahụ maka okporo tren na Naịjirịa bụ Mohammed Babakobi, enyereghị aka n'okwu a, ihe kachasị dị ya mkpa bụ ihe kpatara eji hibe mahadum a n'obodo onye isi ala. 
Amaechi's action, reminds me of the popular Yoruba adage that says forcing a man to get married is not a big deal, but making him to make provision for the family is the real work .	Ihe Amaechi mere, na-echetara m usoro ilu ndị ofe mmanụ a ma ama na-ekwu na ịmanye nwoke ịlụ nwaanyị abụghị mkpa, mana ime ka ọ zụọ ezinaụlọ ya nri bụ ọrụ .
Beyond constructing a university structure, there are numerous questions that Amaechi must answer to convince Nigerians that he understands what he is doing .	N'agbanyeghị iwu mahadum a, enwere ọtụtụ ajụjụ Amaechi ga-azariri iji mee ka ndị Naịjirịa kwenye na ọ ghọtara ihe ọ na-eme .
For example, he needs to come clear on who owns the university and the institution that is funding it .	Dịka ọmụmaatụ, ọ kwesiri ịpụta kwuo onye nwe mahadum ahụ na ụlọ ọrụ na-akwado ya .
Is it to be fully funded by the Chinese government or partly funded by the Federal Government ?	Ọ bụ ndị gọọmentị China ga-enweta ego nkwado ya ka ọ bụ gọọmentị etiti na-akwado ?
The only reason why anybody should be excited about a transportation university in Nigeria at a time like this as far as I am concerned is if the CCECC is fully running it as a gift to Nigeria .	Naanị otu ihe mere mmadụ ọ bụla kwesịrị iji nwee obi ụtọ banyere mahadum njem na Naịjirịa n'oge dị ka nke a bụ na ọ bụrụ na ọ bụ CCECC na-arụ ya nke ọma dịka onyinye nye Naịjirịa .
But, if all that CCECC is doing is to construct a university as part of its corporate social responsibility, then Amaechi's display of a sense of achievement is totally misplaced .	Mana, ọ bụrụ na ihe niile CCECC na-eme bụ ibulite mahadum dị ka akụkụ nke ọrụ mmekọrịta ya na ụlọ ọrụ, mgbe ahụ, ngosipụta Amaechi gosipụtara na ọ ga-eme ka a mata nke ọma ma inwe mahadum njem ọ bụ ihe kachasị mkpa na Naịjirịa .
If government wants to develop transportation, what stops it from expanding transport departments in existing universities ?	Ọ bụrụ na gọọmentị chọrọ imepụta ngalaba njem, gịnị na-egbochi ya ịgbasa ngalaba njem na mahadum ndị dị ugbu a ?
The Institute of Transportation in Zaria is there as well as many others .	Ụlọ akwụkwọ nke ụgbọ njem dị na Zaria na ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ .
The Federal Government could have simply increased the capacity of existing institutions to provide better manpower and training in the sector.	Gọọmentị etiti gaara enyekwu ikike nye ụlọ ọrụ ndị dị ugbu a iji nye ndị mmadụ ọzụzụ kachasị mma na mpaghara ahụ .
For me, it doesn't make any difference where the university is sited.	Maka m, ọ nweghị ọdịiche ọ bụla ebe edoziri mahadum ahụ .

The reason given by President Buhari for establishing the Transportation University is even more interesting.	Ebumnuche nke Onye isi ala Buhari nyere maka iguzobe Mahadum ugbọ njem na-adọrọ mmasị karị .
According to him, the university will bring rapid development to the nation's transport sector and generate both academic and non-academic employment opportunities to Nigerians.

Many of the university administrators are struggling to cope.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ndị na-elekọta mahadum na-agbasi mbọ ike ịnagide .
Recently, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Ibadan, Prof. Idowu Olayinka, revealed that what the university was getting as overhead was less than N100m, whereas it needs a minimum of N800m for overhead.

When several countries are operating driverless trains and efficient underground rail system, Nigeria is still struggling to construct surface rail systems .

Engaging in high research and experimentation is one of the hallmarks of universities all over the world.	Itinye aka na nyocha dị elu na nnwale bụ otu n'ime ihe e ji mara mahadum n'ụwa niile .
How much budget does Nigeria devote to research in its universities ?	Ego ole ka Naịjirịa na-etinye na nyocha na mahadum ya?
As of today, Africa, as a continent, produces one per cent of research technologies in the world. 	Ruo taa, Afrịka, dịka kọntinenti, na -emepụta otu pasenti nke nyocha n'ime ụwa.
Tackling this problem should be of more importance to the giant of Africa than turning universities to a constituency project.	Ijikwa nsogbu a kwesịrị ịbụ ihe kachasị mkpa nye ndị Africa karịa ịtụgharị mahadum ka ọ bụrụ ọrụ mpaghara.

For those who will argue that this is the essence of establishing Transportation University, I challenge them to tell Nigerians where they hope to get the academic staff that will run the university from.

The day after the article appeared, a comrade, Wumi Raji, who is a Leftist academic at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, called me on phone .	Otu ụbọchị ka edemede ahụ pụtachara, otu komred bụ Wumi Raji, onye bụ onye agụmakwụkwọ akaịpa na Mahadum Obafemi Awolowo, Ile-Ife kpọrọ m na ekwentị.
After the usual pleasantries, he respectfully 'complained' that my article ended abruptly, that he had expected me to answer or begin to answer the questions I posed .	Mgbe ọ masịrị ya, ọ jiri nkwanye ugwu 'kọchaa' na edemede m gwụrụ na-akụghị ekwe, na ọ tụrụ anya na m ga-aza ma ọ bụ malite ịza ajụjụ ndị m jụrụ.
As I was about to suggest a time for us to discuss the answers on phone, he expressed preference for a written response – perhaps a sequel to the previous article .	Ka m na-achọ ịtụwa oge ka anyị kpaa mkparịta ụka n'ekwentị, o kwupụtara mmasị maka nzaghachi edereede m - ikekwe ide asịsam ede.
Finally, he 'requested' that the sequel should not take too long in coming .	N'ikpeazụ, ọ 'rịọrọ' ka usoro ahụ ghara iwe ogologo oge.
When he asked what I thought of his 'request' I told him bluntly that I did not understand what he asked me to do as a request, that I understood it as a comradely order which, coming, in particular, from his generation, I could not turn down.	Mgbe ọ jụrụ m ihe m chere banyere 'arịrịọ' a, agwara m ya n'ezoghị ọnụ na aghọtaghị m ihe ọ gwara m ka m mee dị ka arịrịọ, na m ghọtara ya dị ka iwu nke, na-abịa, ọkachasị, n'ọgbọ ya, m enweghị ike ịgbatu.
Wumi Raji did not give me any space in our brief telephone conversation to say something that I would have liked to say, namely, that my questions were drafted as open questions to the Nigerian Left.	Wumi Raji enyeghị m ohere ọ bụla na mkparịta ụka ekwentị dị mkpirikpi iji kwuo ihe m ga-enwe mmasị ikwu, ya bụ, na edepụtara ajụjụ m dị ka ajụjụ azịza nye n'aka ekpe ndị Nigeria.
They were not drafted as an introduction to a 'lecture' which, perhaps, I was preparing to deliver; nor were they rhetorical questions (which demand no answers) nor exam-type questions (which demand answers from entities that exclude the examiner).	E deghị ha ka okwu mmeghe nke 'nkuzi', ikekwe, m na-akwado ikwu; ha abụghịkwa ajụjụ ajụrụ (na achoghi azịza ha) ma ọ bụ ajụjụ (nke chọrọ azịza site n'aka ndi mmadụ ewezuga onye nlere). 
In any case, what, practically, should I or could I do now, I asked myself at the end of my discussion with Raji.	N'ọnọdụ ọ bụla, kedu, ihe m ga - eme ma ọ bụ mee m ugbu a, ajụrụ m onwe m na njedebe nke mkparịta ụka mụ na Raji.
The answer, which came a day later, was that I could expand the questions and supply explanatory notes to some of them.	Azịza ya, nke bịara otu ụbọchị mgbe nke ahụ gasịrị, bụ na m nwere ike ịgbatị ajụjụ na ọkọnọ nkọwa ụfọdụ nye ha.
If I perform these minimum tasks well, I would have begun to contribute to discussions leading to answers.	Ọ bụrụ n'ọrụ ndị a pere mpe ọfụma, aga m amalite itinye aka na mkparịta ụka na-eduga azịza.
If the four questions I have reproduced here are combined, they translate to a loud and angry regret that since the end of Nigeria's Civil War in 1970 and particularly since the 1979 general elections with which the Second Republic (1979-1983) was inaugurated, a sufficiently strong Leftist Revolutionary Party has not emerged in the country to frontally and seriously challenge the ruling capitalist class.	Ọ bụrụ na ejikọta ajụjụ anọ ndị m depụtara ebe a, ha tụgharịrị gaa n'oké iwe na ebe ọ bụ na kemgbe njedebe nke agha Naịjirịa na 1970 na karịsịa kemgbe e guzobere ntuli aka 1979 nke bụ repọblik nke abụọ (1979-1983), ndị otu mgbanwe akaịpa nke nwere ike zuru oke apụtabeghị na mba ahụ n'ihu na ịma ndị isi ọchịchị aka ike ọchịchị.
This serious and frontal challenge would have been either for power or for the dominant political position in the country or, minimally, for a significant shift in the balance of socio-political forces in favour of the working and toiling masses of Nigeria.	Ihe ịma aka a dị mkpa ga-abụ maka ike ma ọ bụ n'ọkwá ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị kachasị na mba ahụ ma ọ bụ obere, maka mgbanwe dị ukwuu na nguzosi ike nke ndị ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị na-akwado ọrụ na ike Naịjirịa.
This regret about what could have happened—but did not, or had not happened—now translates back to a single question, Why?	Ta ụta a banyere ihe gaara eme — ma ọ meghị, ma ọ bụ emeghị — ugbu a sụgharịrị n'otu ajụjụ, N'ihi gịnị?
In my view, a view shared by many Leftists, the major reasons for the non-emergence of a Revolutionary Party, sufficiently strong to frontally and seriously challenge Nigeria's ruling capitalist class may be broadly separated into two segments: the objective and the subjective.	N'echiche m, echiche nke ọtụtụ ndị akaịpa, bụ isi ihe kpatara na enweghị mmalite nke otu mgbanwe, nke nwere ike zuru oke iji chee ihu na ịma ndị isi ọchịchị Naịjirịa aka nwere ike ikewapụ onwe ha ụzọ abụọ: ebumnuche na isiokwu ahụ.
We may defer the objective reasons.	Anyị nwere ike wepụ ebumnuche.
But of the subjective reasons, the most prominent is what I had described as 'differences within the Nigerian Left' (The Guardian, October 4, 2018).	Mana nke ndị metụtara ya, nke akachasị mara bụ nke m kọwara dị ka ndịrịta iche dị n'etiti ndị hapụrụ ala Naịjirịa . (Guardian, Ọktọba 4, 2018).
This important factor will be our focus in the rest of this piece.	Ihe a dị mkpa ga-abụ ihe anyị ga-elebara anya na ibe ya.
It is on account of the differences within the Left that I have insisted, in the last two years, on the production and dissemination of a People's Manifesto.	Ọ bụ n'ihi ọdịiche dị na ekpe a ka m siri ọnwụ na, n'ime afọ abụọ gara aga, na nrụpụta na mgbasa nke Manifesto nke Ndị mmadụ.
My reasoning is that in the process of producing and disseminating the People's Manifesto (The Left platform) the differences that many Leftists presume do not exist, or are not serious, will emerge and be engaged.	Echiche m bụ na n'ịmepụta ma na-agbasa echiche nke Manifesto (nke nyiwe akaịpa) ọdịiche ọtụtụ ndị akaịpa chere na-adị, ma ọ bụ na-adịghị njọ, ga-apụta ma tinye aka .
It is, of course, expected that the Manifesto—which in the process of production and dissemination will begin to resolve our internal differences—will first appear as a robust draft document that attempts to take precise positions on some critical questions before the masses and the nation.	N'ezie, a tụrụ anya na Manifesto — nke ga - emeputa ma kesaa ga - ebido idozi esemokwu dị n'ime anyị - ga - ebu ụzọ gosipụta akwụkwọ siri ike nke na - anwa iweghara ọnọdụ ụfọdụ dị mkpa n'ihu nnukwu mba .
The draft may begin with a Preamble or Introduction: Who we are, what we propose to do, the agency of the revolutionary transformation and the social forces of the transformation.	Mpempe akwụkwọ ahụ nwere ike ịmalite ma ọ bụ Okwu Mmalite: wenye anyị bụ, ihe anyị na-atụ alo ime, ụlọ ọrụ nke mgbanwe na ndị otu ndị na - eme mgbanwe .
It may then go on to Popular-Democratic Ideas (constitutional and republican democracy, the rule of law, the state and the people, socioeconomic rights, political rights and civil rights).	Ọ nwere ike ịga n'ihu na echiche ndị ọchịchị onye kwuo uche ya (usoro iwu ọchịchị onye kwuo uche ya na usoro iwu, steeti na ndị mmadụ, ikike mmekọrịta ọha na eze, ikike ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị na ikike obodo).
It may then proceed to Strategy of the Revolutionary Transformation; Democratic Governance; Philosophy of Governance and Principles of State Policy; SocioEconomic Restructuring; The National Question, National Unity and Geo-political Restructuring; National Independence and Foreign Policy.	Ọ nwere ike ịga n'ihu na Usoro nke Mgbanwe; Ọchịchị onye kwuo uche ya; Nkà ihe ọmụma banyere ọchịchị na ụkpụrụ nke iwu Ọchịchị; Idozi akụ na ụba ndị mmadụ; Ajụjụ Mba ahụ, ịdị n'otu mba na idozigharị ihe ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị; Nnwereonwe nke mba na iwu Ofesi.
The document should, of course, end with a Transitional Programme (immediate agenda).	Akwụkwọ ahụ kwesịrị, n'ezie, ijedebe na Usoro Mgbanwe (usoro a na-eme ozugbo).
My current position on each of these proposed elements of a Peoples Manifesto has been explicit in my published articles of the past two years.	Ekwupụtalam ọnọdụ m na nke ọ bụla ugbu a n'ime akwụkwọ m bipụtara n'afọ abụọ gara aga.
But a particular sensitive subject—the National Question—requires further explanatory notes here.	Ma otu isiokwu dị ire - ajụjụ nke mba - chọrọ nkọwa ndị ọzọ.
Nigerian Leftists, especially Marxists, know or should know that neither theory nor history has resolved what Marxism knows as the National Question—from the standpoint of Marxism.	Ndị akaịpa nke Naịjirịa, ọkachasị ndị otu Marx ma ọ bụ na edemede ma akụkọ ntolite emebeghị mkpebi nke Marxism, dị ka ajụjụ nke mba - site n'echiche nke Marxism.
Had it been resolved—even if badly—we could have been more confident to take positions on the tragic things that happened within the leaderships of the ruling communist parties of the former Soviet Union, former Yugoslavia and former Czechoslovakia and to the countries and peoples over whom they ruled for decades.	Ọ bụrụ na e kpebiri ya, ọbụlagodi ma ọ dị njọ - anyị nwere ike inwe ntụkwasị obi karịa ịnwe ọnọdụ n'ihe ọjọọ ndị mere n'etiti ndị isi nke ndị otu ọchịchị Kọmunist n'oge mbụ otu Soviet, Yugoslavia na mbụ. Czechoslovakia na mba ndị dị n'ofe ndi ha chiri arọ iri.
If there were a near-settled Marxist position on the National Question the enduring ethnic question in China (since the 1949 Revolution) would not have remained an embarrassing issue for Marxists and socialists everywhere.	Oburu na ndopụta ndị Marxist dị nso n'ajụjụ nke mba China n'abia (kemgbe Mgbanwe nke 1949 ) agaraghị adị ihe idochu ndị Marxist na ndị ọkacha amara n'ebe niile.
If the history of Marxism had handed us a resolution of the National Question, we would have been bolder in taking positions on what happened between Ethiopian and Eritrean Marxists and Leftists in the last quarter of last century.	Ọ bụrụ na akụkọ banyere Marxism wetara anyị mkpebi nke Ajụjụ mba, anyị gaara enwe obi ike were ọnọdụ maka ihe mere n'etiti ndị Etiopia na ndị Eritrea na ndị akaịkpa na nkeji iri na ise gara aga.
And coming home, if we had a near-settled theory or if Marxism had substantially advanced the debate on the National Question since the Russian Revolution and the Third International, Nigerian Marxists would today be bolder to take positions on what happened to the Nigerian Marxist Left during the Nigerian Civil War and on the status of current pro-Biafra Nigerian Marxists.	Ma na abia n'ulo, oburu na anyị nwere echiche dị nso ma ọ bụ nweko nke Marxism mere nke oma na nkparịta ụka nke ala, ajụjụ nke ndị Russia kemgbe ndị Ju nke Russia na ndị nke atọ, ndị ala Marxist ga enwe obi ike iguzosi ike n'ihe mere ndị ọchịchị nke ndị Marxist n'oge agha obodo Naịjirịa na ọkwa ndị ugbu a.

Let me end the present piece with the following poser: Before, during and after the Russian Revolution, a Marxist tendency closely connected with Lenin introduced 'national oppression' as a 'Marxist category, related to class oppression but not identical with or subordinate to it'	Ka m kwubie okwu a ugbua site n'ihe ndịa: Tupu, n'oge na mgbe mbugharị Russia gasịrị, echiche Marxist nwere njịkọ chiri anya na Lenin gosipụtara 'mmegbu nke mba' dị ka otu 'ụdị Marxist, metụtara mmegbu otu mana ọ bụghị otu ihe ma ọ bụ nọ n'okpuru ya. ',
Whereas in that period, Rosa Luxembourg, who requires no introduction, stood (and still stands) 'at the apex of the attempt to make operational the Marxist concept of class as the primary social referent, and to break once and for all the old alternative stranglehold of nation'.	Ebe oge ahụ, Rosa Luxembourg, onye na-achọghị iwebata, guzo (ma kwụrụ ọtọ)' na njịkọ nke nnwale iji mee ka echiche nke Marxist nke otu bụrụ ntụle maka mmekọrịta mmadụ na ibe ya, yana imebi ozugbo oge niile. uzọ ochie ọzọ nke mba '.
From this poser I propose that Nigerian Leftists, especially those of Marxist orientation, should advance the debate on the National Question and Geopolitical Restructuring in Nigeria with the twin-objective of arriving at a common position in Nigeria and simultaneously contributing to the further development of Marxism on this question.	Site n'okwu a, m na-ekwupụta na ndị akaịpa Naịjirịa, ọkachasị nke mgbakwasị ụkwụ Marxist, kwesịrị ịkwalite arụmụka ahụ na Ajụjụ mba na idozi gburugburu ọchịchị Naịjirịa nwere ebumnuche ibilite n'otu ọnọdụ na Naịjirịa ma n'otu oge na-enye aka maka mmepe nke Marxism n'ajụjụ a.

RE: DSS And The 6th December Federal High Court, Abuja Incident By Lucky Ighoyota	RE: DSS na Ụlọ Ọkaịkpe nke Ụbọchị Isii N'Ọnwa Disemba, ihe mere n'Abuja site n'aka Lucky Ighoyota
The invasion of the Federal High Court on Friday by DSS operatives to perfect a rearrest of Omoyele Sowore and his co-defendant, Olawale Bakare, less than 24 hours after they were granted bail is the highest act of sacrilege against the judicial arm of government that the operative has constantly expressed contempt for .

On Saturday, December 7, 24 hours after the debacle at the Federal High Court, Abuja, the Department of State Services prevaricated about the real fact just to offset its damaged reputation.	Na Satọde, Disemba 7, ka awa iri abụọ garachara, ụlọ ikpe ukwu ahụ, n'Abuja, Ngalaba Na-ahụ Maka Ọrụ kwuru banyere eziokwu n'ezie iji kwụsị aha ya mebiri emebi.
It is no surprise to us or the general public, who are now used to the DSS' novelties of historical records of numerous lies m intended to create a false or misleading impression.	Ọ bụghị ihe ịtụnanya nye anyị ma ọ bụ ọha na eze, bụ ndị maara akụkọ ndị DSS nke nwere ọtụtụ akụkọ ụgha iji mepụta echiche ụgha ma ọ bụ nke na-eduhie eduhie.
The invasion of the Federal High Court on Friday by DSS operatives to perfect a rearrest of Omoyele Sowore and his co-defendant, Olawale Bakare, less than 24 hours after they were granted bail is the highest act of sacrilege against the judicial arm of government that the operative has constantly expressed contempt for.	Mwakpo nke ụlọ ọrụ ndị ọkaịkpe wakporo na Fraịdee ka onye ọrụ ya bụ Omoyele Sowore na onye na - agbachitere ya, Olawale Bakare erughị awa iri abụọ na anọ ka enyere ha ohere mgbapụta bụ ihe kacha mma na-akwado megide ikike ikpe nke gọọmentị. onye ọrụ ahụ egosipụtala nlelị maka ya.
After willfully violating two different court orders that granted bail to Omoyele Sowore, and until Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu's 24-hour ultimatum to the operative, it became an obvious fact that the compliance with the court order was with the ulterior motive of releasing and rearresting Sowore, just to be seen to have obeyed the pending court.	Mgbe akpachara anya mebie iwu ụlọ ikpe abụọ nyere ikike ịgbazigharị Omoyele Sowore, rue mgbe onye ọka ikpe Ijeoma Ojukwu nyere ọrụ ahụ, ọ bịara bụrụ ihe doro anya na nrube isi n'iwu ụlọịkpe ahụ bụ ebumnobi nke ịgbahapụ na iweghachite Sowore, naanị ka a hụ ka o rubere isi n'ụlọ ikpe ahụ.
During the court proceeding of the day under reference, defence counsel, Femi Falana (SAN), intimated the judge of the intention of the DSS to rearrest Sowore, but it was overlooked.	N'oge usoro ikpe nke ụbọchị ahụ n'okpuru ntụnye aka, onye ọka ikpe nchekwa, Femi Falana (SAN), gwara onye ọka ikpe na ebumnuche ndị DSS bụ idobe Sowore, mana elefuru anya.
However, as soon as Sowore was about stepping out of the courtroom, DSS operatives laid hands on him to rearrest him without a charge; hence, the pandemonium between the violent operatives of the DSS and supporters of Sowore who couldn't comprehend the justification for a rearrest barely 24 hours after his release.	Agbanyeghị, ozugbo Sowore na-achọ isi n'ụlọ ikpe ahụ pụta, ndị ọrụ DSS tụkwasara ya aka ịwakpo ya n'enweghị ebubo; N'ihi ya, ọgba aghara dị n'etiti ndị na-eme ihe ike nke DSS na ndị na-akwado Sowore bụ ndị na-enweghị ike ịghọta ihe mere eji eme ihe n'erughị awa 24 ka ahapụchara ya.
Eyewitness and media accounts have it that the DSS operatives stormed the courtroom violently and disrupted proceeding for which the sitting judge, Justice Ojukwu, had to scamper for safety.	Onye hụrụ ya anya na akụkọ mgbasa ozi nwere na ndị ọrụ DSS were iwe were ọsọ wee megharia usoro onye ọka ikpe nọ ebe ahụ, bụ Justice Ojukwu, gbara izu maka nchekwa.
In the press release of the DSS, it accused Sowore's supporters of shielding him from an 'imaginary arrest.'	Na akụkọ mgbasa ozi nke DSS, o boro ndị na-akwado Sowore ebubo na ha na-egbochi ya 'njide efu.' Mana n'eziokwu, mwakpo ahụ gosipụtara na ọ bụghị njide echere n'echiche.
But in reality, the rearrest already proved that it wasn't an imaginary arrest.	Ebe ọ bụ na Sowore pụtara n'ụlọ ikpe maka okwu a na DSS, ndị ọrụ agha na-arụ ọrụ n'ụlọ ikpe ahụ na Disemba 6 dị ọtụtụ karịa mgbe ọ bụla. Nke a bụ iji gosipụta na mwakpo ọzọ awakporo Sowore bụ mkpebi nke ọrụ ahụ kwudịrị tupu ọ tọhapụ ya na Disemba 5!
Since Sowore's appearances in court over this case with the DSS, armed operatives of the service in the court premises on December 6 were greater in number than ever.	N'okwu ndị DSS kwuru na ndị ọrụ ya anọghị n'ime ụlọ ikpe ahụ iji wee mepụta mwakpo ahụ, nyocha dị egwu na ihe nkiri ndị mgbasa ozi na ndị hụrụ ya kpughere gosiri na ụfọdụ ndị ọrụ ha na-eyighị uwe DSS nke akpọrọ aha otu na-adọkpụ Sowore na ala n'ime ogige.
This is to show that Sowore's rearrest was a decision reached by the service even before his release on December 5!	Otu onye n'ime ụmụ nwoke na-eje ozi n'ime ụlọ ikpe ahụ nke onye ọrụ ike Sowore nwere bụ Marshall. 
On the claim by the DSS that its operatives were not inside the courtroom to carry out the rearrest, a critical look at the videos in circulation by the media and eyewitnesses revealed that some men of the operatives not dressed in DSS' branded uniform dragging Sowore on the ground inside the courtroom.	O yighị uwe ndị DSS mara akara.
One of the service men inside the courtroom to forcefully rearrest Sowore was Marshall. He was not dressed in the branded uniform of the DSS. He was in a black jacket as seen in all videos in circulation.	Ọ nọ na jaket ojii dịka a na-ahụ ya na ihe nkiri niile ana-ekesa.
Marshall was always the DSS operative restraining Sowore from speaking with the press during his previous appearances in court.	Marshall bụ onye ọrụ DSS na-egbochi Sowore ka ọ ghara iso ndị nta akụkọ na-ekwu okwu oge ọ gara n'ụlọ ikpe.
Also, it is worthy to note that Sowore while still within the premises of the court told this same Marshall that he was a disgrace.	Ọzọkwa, ọ dị mma ịmara na Sowore mgbe ọ ka nọ n'ụlọ ikpe ahụ gwara otu Marshall na ọ bụ ihe ihere.
With this fact alone, it is abundantly clear that after 24 hours of silence over the court debacle by the DSS, in a bid to salvage their publicly damaged reputation, they still couldn't manufacture a 'smart lie' that serves to make amends.	N'ezie eziokwu a, o doro anya nke ukwuu na mgbe awa 24 nke ịgbachi nkịtị gbasara akwụkwụ ụlọ ikpe nke ndị DSS, n'ịzọ iwepụ aha ha mebiri emebi n'ihu ọha, ha ka nwere ike ghara imepụta 'amamịghe ụgha' nke na-enyere aka ịgbanwe.
It is unthinkable of the DSS to accuse Sowore of addressing a group of persons at Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, on the same day of his release of a 'reassured cause' to create anarchy in the country.	Ọ bụ ihe jọgburu onwe ya na ndị DSS boro Sowore ka ọ kpọọ otu mmadụ okwu na ụlọ nkwari Transcorp Hilton, Abuja, n'otu ụbọchị a tọhapụrụ ya 'ihe masiri obi ike' iji mepụta ọgbaghara na mba ahụ.
This allegation is spurious, bogus, fake, and inauthentic.The DSS intends to make the public think something that is not true.	Ebubo a bụ okwu ojoo, okwu ugha, na-abụghị eziokwu. Ndị DSS bu n'obi ime ka ọha na eze chee ihe na-abụghị eziokwu.
In other words, the DSS is trying to establish the basis for rearresting Sowore to be that he had violated one of his bail conditions. This is laughable!	N'ikwu ya n'ụzọ ọzọ, DSS na-anwapụta ihe ndabere maka ijigide Sowore na ọ bụ na ọ dara iwu otu ịgbapụta ya. Nke a bụ ihe ọchị!
It is on record that when the DSS earlier insisted on validating the sureties to Sowore's bail, Justice m Ojukwu asked the counsel to the DSS if the agency was running a parallel court.	Ọ bụ na ndekọ na mgbe ndị DSS kwusiri ike na nkwado nke ịgba akwụkwọ Sowore ebubo, Justice M. Ojukwu jụrụ ndụmọdụ DSS ma ọ bụrụ na ụlọ ọrụ ahụ na-arụ ọrụ ụlọ ọrụ ọzọ yiri ya.
Most reasonably now, if a bail condition has been violated, it is of the same court that gave the conditions to determine that. The bail conditions were not by the DSS but by the court.	Ihe kachasị dị ugbu a, ọ bụrụ na emebila mgbapụtaa, ọ bụ otu ụlọikpe ahụ nyere ọnọdụ iji kpebie nke ahụ. Ọnọdụ mgbapụta abụghị nke ndị DSS kama ọ bụ nke ndị ụlọ ikpe.
By DSS' inconsistent actions, the agency has assumed both the role of the court, the law, and the judge in this matter. This is a tragedy and a travesty of justice.	Site na omume DSS, ndị ụlọ ọrụ ahụ ewerela ọrụ ụlọ ikpe, iwu na onye ọka ikpe n'okwu a. Nke a bụ ọdachi na aghụghọ nke ikpe.
DSS' historical records of numerous lies, human right violations, court contempt, and the recent desecration of the court all speak of one truth, which is, the operative is unabashedly unruly and does not have the genetic composition to abide by the law.	Ihe ndekọ akụkọ ihe mere eme nke DSS nke ọtụtụ ụgha, mmebi iwu ndị ruuru mmadụ, nlelị ụlọ ikpe, na mmejọ ụlọ ikpe na nsonso a, na-ekwu maka otu eziokwu, ya bụ, ndị na-arụ ọrụ na-enweghị isi na enweghị usoro mkpụrụ ndụ iji rube isi n'iwu.

A wise saying has it that the evil that men do live after them.	Okwu amam-ihe kwuru na ihe ọjọ nke mmadụ so ya biri.
DSS' unequivocal reputation for false alarms is a psychological self-defense mechanism to preempt the provocative paranoia their oppressive tendencies are stirring in Nigerians.	DSS 'aha enweghị nkatọ maka mkpu ụgha bụ usoro nchedo onwe onye iji gbochie ajọ mkpamkpa nke omume mmegbu ha na-akpali na ndị Naịjirịa.

Recalling Tai Solarin's Prediction By Edwin Madunagu	Icheta amụma Tai Solarin Site Edwin Madunagu

Nigeria's 2019 elections, particularly the recent governorship contests in Kogi and Bayelsa states, have forcefully brought back a prediction which the late Tai Solarin made about 40 years ago in the aftermath of the 1979 elections.	Ntụli aka nke 2019 nke Naịjirịa, karịsịa asọmpi gọvanọ n'oge na-adịbeghị anya na steeti Kogi na Bayelsa, ejirila ike weghachite amụma nke onye ikpe azụ Tai Solarin mara ihe dị ka afọ 40 gara aga na ntụli aka nke 1979.
Of course, recalling this prediction is also recalling my response to it at the time.	N'ezie, ịcheta amụma a na-echetakwa azịza m n'ebe m nọ n'oge ahụ.
I was then 33.	Adị m afọ 33 mgbe ahụ.
It is appropriate to begin any story I might wish to tell here by introducing Tai Solarin to young Nigerians who were not born when the prediction was made.	Ọ dị mma ịmalite akụkọ ọ bụla m nwere ike ịkọ ebe a site na iwebata Tai Solarin na ndị na-eto eto ndị Naịjirịa na-amụghị amụ mgbe amara amụma ahụ.
This set of Nigerians now constitutes the majority of the Nigerian population.	Ndi Naịjirịa ugbu a mejupụtara ọnụ ọgụgụ ndị mmadụ nọ n'Naịjirịa.
Tai Solarin was a prominent Nigerian male from South-Western Nigeria who was a secular humanist and educationist, but whose humanism was exceptional because it was all-round (that is, in thought as well as in action), consistent, courageous and well-informed.	Tai Solarin bụ nwa nwoke ama ama nke Naịjirịa si mpaghara ọdịda-ọwụwa anyanwụ nke Naịjirịa nke bụ onye ọrụ ụwa na agụmakwụkwọ, mana ọrụ mmadụ ya enweghị atụ n'ihi (ya bụ n'echiche na omume) nnagide ya, obi isi ike ya na oke mmụta ya. 
Tai Solarin was not a Marxist, not a communist and not a worker by class placement.	Tai Solarin abụghị onye Marxist, ọ bụghị onye komunizim ọ bụghị onye ọrụ site na idobe otu.
But he was a proletarian in lifestyle.	Mana ọ bụ onye mkwado ndụ.
In politics he would be described as a progressive, but not a progressive in the mould of the present-day Nigeria's neofascist 'progressive'.	Na ndọrọndọrọ ọchịchị a ga-akọwa ya dịka onye na - aga n'ihu, mana ọbụghị onye na - aga n'ihu ugbua ndị Naịjirịa 'na-aga n'ihu'.
Tai Solarin was a progressive in the original sense of being located in the Leftist ideological and political universe.	Tai Solarin bụ ihe na-agagharị n'echiche mbụ nke ịbụ onye nọ na mpaghara echiche ndị akaịkpa na ụwa ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị.
He was, in general, a 'social critic' and, in particular, a critical, popular and respected newspaper columnist.	Ọ bụ ya n'ozuzu ya, 'onye nkatọ mmekọrịta mmadụ na ibe ya' na ọkachasị, ọ bụ onye edemede akụkọ pụrụ iche, ama ama ma na-akwanyere ùgwù.
Now to the beginning of this piece.	Ugbu a ruo n'isi mmalite nke mpempe a.
We may recall that Nigeria's Second Republic began on October 1, 1979 after a 13-year period (1966-1979) of military rule that witnessed a civil war.	Anyị nwere ike icheta na ọchịchị onye kwuo uche nke abụọ Naịjirịa malitere na Ọktọba 1, 1979 mgbe afọ 13 (1966-1979) nke ọchịchị ndị agha nke hụrụ agha obodo .
In the general elections that ushered in the Republic, Shehu Shagari of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) emerged as (Executive) President and Obafemi Awolowo of the Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) emerged as the second strongest presidential candidate.	Na ntuli aka niile emere na ọchịchị onye kwuo uche ya, Shehu Shagari nke otu mba Naịjirịa (NPN) pụtara dị ka (Ezekutiv) onye isi ala na Obafemi Awolowo nke otu njịkọ Naịjirịa (UPN) pụtara dịka onye ntuli aka nke abụọ.
The result was, to say the least, very contentious—as we can recall or research.	Nsonaazụ ya bụ, ịsị ntakịrị, oke esemokwu — dịka anyị nwere ike icheta ma ọ bụ mee nyocha.
But the issue here is neither the contentiousness of the result of the presidential contest nor the side which Tai Solarin supported.	Mana ihe dị ebe a abụghị esemokwu nke nsonaazụ onye isi ala ma ọ bụ akụkụ nke Tai Solarin kwadoro.
He was a member of the UPN .	Ọ bụ onye otu n'ime ndị UPN .
Rather, we are concerned with his prediction five weeks into the new Republic.	Kama, anyị na-echebara amụma ya izu ise ga-abanye na mba ọhụrụ.
On November 4, 1979, 34 days after the installation of President Shehu Shagari, the Sunday edition of the Tribune newspaper carried a column by Tai Solarin titled The Stolen Presidency.	Na Nọvemba 4, 1979, ụbọchị 34 ka e hibechara Onye isi ala Shehu Shagari, mbipụta Sọnde nke akwụkwọ akụkọ ikpe bụ otu nke Tai Solarin kpọrọ aha oche Onye isi ezuuru .
In it the columnist wrote: 'If this government lasts four years the four-year-old NPN will have been firmly planted as Government Party everywhere, and the UPN, the GNPP, the NPP and the PRP will have been drained to annihilation, both in membership—it is already starting—and in morale.	N'ime ya, onye edemede ahụ dere, sị: 'Ọ bụrụ na gọọmentị a ga-adị afọ anọ… NPN ga-anọ etinyere onwe ya dịka otu Ọchịchị ebe niile, na UPN, GNPP, NPP na PRP ga-ebibikwa ma ndi otu ya - o bidola - na ihe omumu.
The 1983 election would therefore be between the NPN and the Revolutionary Party which, having studied how the NPN came to power knows exactly what to do to supplant the NPN for the presidency.	Ntụli aka nke afọ 1983 ga-adị n'etiti NPN na otu mgbanwe, ebe ọ mụrụ banyere NPN wee bụrụ ọchịchị maara nke ọma ihe ọ ga-eme itinye onye NPN maka onye isi ala.
There would then be a confusion on the national raft.	A ga-enwe ọgba aghara na ụdọ mba ahụ.
Then commotion among the sharks.	Mgbe ahụ ọgbaghara n'etiti ndị shark.
And we, the common people, will have, as victims, paid the supreme sacrifice'.	Anyị onwe anyị, ndị nkịtị, ga-akwụrịrị ụgwọ dị ka ndị a na-enye ụgwọ.
My comment on this prediction was immediate—as was expected in those days.	Ihe m kwuru banyere amụma a bụ ihe ozugbo - dịka a tụrụ anya n'oge ahụ.
It appeared in an edition of the Nigerian Chronicle, a daily newspaper owned and published by the Cross River State government.	Ọ pụtara na mbipụta nke akwụkwọ akụkọ nke Naịjirịa, akwụkwọ akụkọ kwa ụbọchị nke gọọmentị Cross River dere ma bipụta ya.
The comment was later revised and included in the text of a lecture I delivered at the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) in November 1980 under the auspices of the institution's Alliance of Progressive Students (ALPS) on the occasion of the 31st anniversary of the killing of Nigerian miners at the Iva Valley Mines, Enugu, by the colonial police.	Edegharịrị nkwupụta ahụ ma tinye ya na ederede okwu nkuzi m kwuru na Mahadum Ife (Mahadum Obafemi Awolowo ugbu a) na Nọvemba 1980 n'okpuru nkwado nke ụlọ Akwụkwọ Ndị Ọzụzụ Ndị Mmụta (ALPS) n'oge emume ncheta nke 31 nke ogbugbu ndị na-egwu ala Naịjirịa na ndagwurugwu Iva Valley, Enugwu, site n'aka ndị uwe ojii .
And later still, in May 1981, the comment was included in a book which emanated from the lecture.	Ma mesịa, na Mee 1981, ekwupụtara nkọwa a n'akwụkwọ nke si na nkuzi ahụ .
The lecture as well as the book that emanated from it were titled: Human Progress and Its Enemies: The Struggle for a more humane social order in Nigeria.	Okwu nkuzi a yana akwụkwọ nke si na ya pụta bụ aha akpọrọ: oganihu mmadụ na iro Ya: Mgba maka usoro mmekọrịta mmadụ na ibe ya karị na Naịjirịa.
In the book, I said, 'Tai Solarin's prediction is unusual in two ways.	N'akwụkwọ ahụ, ekwuru m, 'Amụma Tai Solarin bụ ihe pụrụ iche n'ụzọ abụọ .
In the first place, Tai Solarin was predicting the disintegration and demise of his party, the UPN.	Na mbu, Tai Solarin na-ebu amụma banyere mwepu na mbibi nke otu ya, UPN .
In the second place he was predicting that it would require a Revolutionary Party to dislodge the NPN from power: a type of prediction that normally comes from a revolutionary and not a liberal.	N'ebe nke abụọ ọ na-ebu amụma na ọ ga-achọ ndị otu mgbanwe iji chụpụ NPN n'ike: ụdị amụma na-esitekarị na ngagharị iwe abụghị nke na-emesapụ aka .
We may ignore Tai Solarin's scenario—for the Revolutionary Party, when it emerges, will not fight according to the rules fashioned by the enemies of progress.	Anyị nwere ike ileghara ọnọdụ Tai Solarin anya - maka otu mgbanwe, mgbe ọ na-apụta, ọ gaghị agha dịka iwu nke ndị iro nke ọganiihu siri dị .
But we agree completely that the NPN, as a political party, is today the best organization of the Nigerian bourgeoisie and the most accurate reflection of Nigerian bourgeois interests.	Mana anyị kwenyere kpam kpam na NPN, dịka ndị otu ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị, bụ taa ọgbakọ kacha mma nke ndọrọndọrọ ọchịchị Naịjirịa na ngosipụta ziri ezi gbasara ọdịmma ndị Naịjirịa .
So long as the bourgeois social order remains so long will the NPN (or a new monster it may give birth to) continue to be the dominant political organization of the bourgeoisie.'	Ọ bụrụhaala na usoro ọdịmma ọha mmadụ ka ga-anọ ogologo oge, NPN (ma ọ bụ anụ ọhụrụ ọ nwere ike ịmụ) ga-anọgide na-abụ nzukọ ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị kachasị elu nke ndị ogaranya .
It follows from above that 'only a revolutionary agency, representing the true aspirations of the popular masses (the workers, the peasants, students, etc.) and fighting consistently for an entirely new social order, can ever dislodge the NPN from power.	O si n'elu pụta na 'naanị ụlọ ọrụ na-agbanwe agbanwe, na-anọchite anya ezi ọchịchọ nke ọha mmadụ a ma ama (ndị ọrụ, ndị nkịtị, ụmụ akwụkwọ, wdg) na ịlụ ọgụ maka usoro mmekọrịta ọha na eze kpamkpam, nwere ike ịchụpụ NPN n'ike .
To that extent—and to that extent alone—we agree with Tai Solarin.	Ruo ókè ahụ — na ruo naanị ọnụ ụzọ ahụ - anyị kwenyere Tai Solarin .
But we do not share his pessimism.	Ma anyị adịghị enwe echiche enweghị nchekwube .
A revolution cannot be conceived in a pessimistic perspective.	Enweghị ike ịtụgharị mgbanwe site n'ọnọdụ ọjọọ .
A revolution—to use the words of Leon Trotsky—is incompatible with pessimism and other forms of spiritual collapse.	Ntughari - iji okwu Leon Trotsky na-emegide enweghị nchekwube na ụdị mbibi ime mmụọ ndị ọzọ .
Tai Solarin's pessimism arose from the fact that he made a separation between the people and the Revolutionary Party—a type of separation that exists between the people and the existing political parties.	Nkwuputa okwu Tai Solarin sitere na eziokwu ahụ ọ kewara ndị mmadụ na ndị otu mgbanwe - ụdị nkewa dị n'etiti ndị mmadụ na ndị otu ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị dị ugbu a .
A genuine revolution can only be made by the people under the leadership of their revolutionary organization, and such a revolution demands the highest forms of optimism and moral courage.'	Naanị ndị ndu ha nwere ike ịme nghazigharị, mgbanwe dị otú ahụ chọrọ ụdị nchekwube kachasị elu na obi ike omume .
Looking now at this nearly 40-year old 'exchange' between Tai Solarin and myself, it strikes me that I could myself not have realized its full import.	N'ileghachi anya ugbu a ihe 'afọ agbanweta' n'etiti Tai Solarin na onwe m, ọ na-akụ m n'enweghị m ike ịghọta na mbubata ya zuru oke .
Tai Solarin said only a Revolutionary Party could dislodge the NPN from power.	Tai Solarin kwuru na ọ bụ naanị otu mgbanwe nwere ike ịchụpụ NPN n'ike .
I agreed with him but amended the proposition by replacing 'NPN' with the phrase 'NPN or a new monster it might give birth to'.	Ekwenyere m ya ma mezie echiche ahụ site n'iji 'NPN' dochie 'NPN' ma ọ bụ ogologo anụ mmiri ọ nwere ike ịmụ ' .
This suggests that I had a 'flash' that NPN could be succeeded by another party—or another entity—but nonetheless, a 'monster' (such as a military junta) organically emerging from NPN.	Nke a na-egosi na enwere m 'ọkụ' nke NPN nwere ike bụrụ onye ọzọ - ma ọ bụ onye ọzọ ga - anọchi - mana agbanyeghị, 'anụ mmiri' (dịka isi iyi ndị agha) na-esite na NPN .
But the 'flash' was not pursued.	Mana 'ịcha ọkụ' ahụ achughị.
It is clear that the class perspective was missing from Tai Solarin's analysis and prediction.	O doro anya na echiche otu ahụ nyocha na ịkọ amụma Tai Solarin .
This is explicable, given that he was not a Marxist.	Nke a bụ ihe kwere omume, ebe ọ bụ na ọ bụghị ndị otu Marx .
But my response was also not sufficiently ideological.	Ma azịza m ezughị echiche m zuru ezu .
Let me explain.	Ka m kọwaa .
In political-ideological contestation, even in our own context, the terms 'bourgeois' and 'capitalist' are not simply interchangeable.	Na ndoro-ndoro echiche nke ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị, ọbụlagodi n'ọnọdụ nke anyị, okwu 'ndị ọgaranya' na 'onye isi ike' abụghị ndị agbanwere .
The absence of 'capitalist' in my 'disquisition' qualifies it as petty-bourgeois, even if revolutionary.	Enweghị 'ikeketeorie' na 'ọkwa m' mere ka ọ pụta ìhè dịka obere-ọgaranya, ọbụlagodi ma ọ bụrụ na mgbape agba .
If I had adopted a more appropriate ideological posture I would have stated explicitly that what I was alluding to was the removal of the capitalist class, as a class, and not just its political organisations like the NPN.	ọbụrụ na mụ tinye echiche ziri ezi karie, m ga ekwupụta n'ụzọ na ihe m na-atụgharị bụ iwepu ndị akwụkwọ ikekarị ya dịka akwụkwọ, ọbụghị ndị otu ndọrọ-ndọrọ ọchịchị ya dịka ndị NPN.
Having said this, the questions now are: Why is it that for almost 40 years, I have periodically—after every major election or change of government—felt the way I felt following the 1979 general elections and Tai Solarin's prediction?	Mgbe ikwuru nke a, ajụjụ dị ugbu a bụ: Gini mere na ọ fọrọ obere ka ọ bụrụ afọ iri anọ, na-enwe oge - mgbe ọ bụla ntuli aka ma ọ bụ mgbanwe ọ bụla nke gọọmentị - nwere mmetụta dị m ka m soro ntụli aka ndị isi na 1979 na amụma Tai Solarin ?
 Why is it that despite the Nigerian Left's insistence, at least since 1979, on the inevitability and irreducibility of a Revolutionary Party, the party has not emerged?	Gini mere na agbanyeghị na mkparịta ụka nke ndị akaịpa Naịjirịa, ọ dịkarịa ala kemgbe 1979, na-aga-agharịrị na enweghị mgbagha nke otu Ree, otu ahụ apụtabeghị ?
 Why should we find ourselves repeating the same theses and propositions after every bloody and farcical display called 'election'?	Kedu ihe kpatara anyị ga - eji hụ na anyị na - emegharị otu echiche na atụmatụ a mgbe ngosipụta ọbara niile na nke ọrụ ugbo na - akpọ 'ntụli aka'?
Does it mean that nothing has changed fundamentally in Nigeria's social order or in the Leftist challenge to it, or both?	O putara na onweghi ihe gbanwegogoro n'usoro ọrụ ndị mmadụ na Naịjirịa ma ọ bụ n'ime aka ndị akaịpa na ya, ma ọ bụ ha abụọ ?
How has Nigeria's ruling capitalist class been able to periodically renew itself, assume new organizational forms and continue its rule?	Kedụ ka ndị otu ọchịchị onye isi ala Naịjirịa siri nwee ike ịhazi onwe ha oge ụfọdụ, wee were usoro nhazi ọhụụ wee gaa n'ihu na-achị ya ?
Put differently, why has it not been possible to overthrow Nigeria's ruling capitalist class, as a class, or dislodge it as the dominant political force?	N'akụkụ dị iche, gịnị kpatara na ọ kaghị enwe ike ịkwatu ndị isi ọchịchị onye isi ala Naịjirịa, dị ka otu, ma ọ bụ tufuo ya dịka ike ọchịchị kacha ike?

Reflections On Cold War And Africa's Human Progress By Phumlani Majozi	Ntughari banyere agha Nzuzo na Ọganihu ndị Afrika Mmadụ Site na Phumlani Majozi
In contrast to 30 years ago, the world is a better place in consideration of almost all the metrics of human development including economic growth, healthcare, access to education, and human right.	N'adịghị ka afọ iri atọ gara aga, ụwa bụ ebe kachasị mma n'ịtụle ihe omimi niile nke mmepe mmadụ gụnyere mmepe akụ na ụba, ahụike, ịnweta agụmakwụkwọ, na ikike mmadụ .
This rate of progress is unprecedented in human history.	Mmụba a a na-enwe n'ihu bụ ihe a na-ahụtụbeghị mbụ n'akụkọ mmadụ .
My colleague at African Liberty, Alexander Hammond, has done incredible work on global human progress for the Cato Institute.	Onye ọrụ ibe m na ntọghapụ ndị Afrika, Alexander Hammond, arụwo ọrụ dị egwu na ọganihu mmadụ na ụwa maka ụlọ akwụkwọ Cato.
Unsurprisingly, it's only after the Cold War that we have seen extraordinary advancements in technology and declines in global poverty rates.	N'agha, ọ bụ naanị mgbe Agha Nzuzo gasịrị ka anyị hụworo ọganihu pụrụ iche na teknọlọjị wee jupụta na ọnụego ịda ogbenye zuru ụwa ọnụ .
But before the fall of the Berlin Wall, the world was divided.	Mana tupu ọdịda nke mgbidi Berlin, ụwa kewara .
While Russia led the Soviet Union on a mission to turn the world into a communist paradise, the United States (US) invested huge resources to stall the Soviet Union's communist ambitions.	Ezie na Russia duuru otu Soviet na ụwa ime ka ụwa ghọọ paradaịs, United States (US) tinyere ego buru ibu iji kwụsị ebumnuche ndị otu Soviet .
The two countries, Russia and the United States, had distinct philosophical worldviews; communism and capitalism.	Mba abụọ a, Russia na United States, nwere echiche nkà ihe ọmụma ụwa dị iche; komunizim na ikeketeorie .
Because of their differences, they both exploited many resources to advance their ideologies to every corner of the globe.	N'ihi ọdịiche ha, ha abụọ jiri ọtụtụ akụ rụọ ọrụ iji bulie echiche ha n'akụkụ niile nke ụwa.
The clash of these ideologies has resulted in incessant global instability, which negatively affects almost all regions of the world.	Esemokwu nke echiche ndị a akpatawo ọgba aghara zuru ụwa ọnụ, nke na-emetụta ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ mpaghara niile nke ụwa .
Multilateral institutions like the United Nations became an ideological battlefield for the two powers.	Otutu ụlọ ọrụ dịka out jikọrọ mba ụwa United buru agha ebe ndị echiche ha nọ buru agha.
In that tumultuous period in human history, none of us benefited; in fact, things became worse for much of the developing world with political dysfunction fuelled, in part, by the Cold War.	N'oge ọgba aghara ahụ n'akụkọ ihe mere eme nke mmadụ, ọ dịghị onye ọ bụla n'ime anyị ritere uru; n'ezie, ihe kara njọ maka ọtụtụ mba na-emepe emepe, ebe ọnụọgụ ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị ka ọkụ, akụkụ ya ụfọdụ, site na Agha Nzuzo .
Today, sadly, people tend to underestimate the harm that was done by this global ideological standoff that lasted decades.	Taa, ọ dị mwute ikwu na ndị mmadụ na-echefukarị nsogbu nke esemokwu echiche ụwa niile nke were ọtụtụ afọ ime .
Could it be due to short memories?	O nwere ike ibute obere ncheta?
Well, the African continent was one of the Cold War battlegrounds.	N'ezie, Afrika bụ otu n'ime ala ndi agha .
My homeland, South Africa, was one of the victims of the Cold War.	Ala nna m, ọdịda nke Afrika, bụ otu n'ime ndị ihe metụtara Agha Nzuzo .
One of the reasons why it took us longer to end apartheid was because global powers saw our struggle against apartheid in the Cold War lens; Americans viewed Nelson Mandela as a communist and they believed his outlawed political movement, the African National Congress, was funded by Moscow.	Otu n'ime ihe mere o jiri were anyị ogologo oge ịkwụsị ịkpa ókè agbụrụ bụ n'ihi na ike ụwa niile hụrụ mgba anyị na-alụ megide ịkpa ókè agbụrụ na agha oyi; Ndị Amerika lere Nelson Mandela dị ka onye ọchịchị Kọmunist, ha kwenyere na ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị ya, ndị kongres Afrika, nke Moscow kwadoro.
The US and Britain were conflicted about the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, hence, when we talk about the history of South Africa's black struggle against apartheid, we should not isolate it from the dynamics of the Cold War.	US na Britain gbara mgba banyere ọgụ megide ịkpa ókè agbụrụ na South Africa, n'ihi ya, mgbe anyị na-ekwu banyere akụkọ banyere ọgụ ojii South Africa megide ịkpa ókè agbụrụ, anyị ekwesịghị ikewapụ ya na Agha Nzuzo.
The Cold War raged on for years in Zaire — now the Democratic Republic of Congo — as the country endured crisis after crisis.	agha oyi ahụ bidoro ruo ọtụtụ afọ na Zaire - ugbu a ọchịchị onye kwuo uche ya na Congo - ka mba ahụ diri mgbe nsogbu gasịrị .
The political turmoil that culminated in Patrice Lumumba's brutal death in 1961, usually called the Congo Crisis, was in part, fuelled by the power struggle between Russia and the US.	Ọgba aghara ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị ahụ bilitere na ọnwụ obi ọjọọ Patrice Lumumba na 1961, nke a na-akpọkarị Kọnị Kongo, bụ akụkụ nke mgbagha ike dị n'etiti Russia na US kpalitere .
The corrupt Mobuto Sese Seko who took power in 1965 and ran Zaire to the ground, was supported by the United States for most of his tyrannical rule because he was an ally against the Soviet Union.	Onye nrụrụ aka bụ Mobuto Sese Seko onye weghaara ọchịchị na 1965 wee gbaa Zaire n'ala, ndị United States kwadoro ya maka ọtụtụ ọchịchị aka ike ya n'ihi na ọ bụ onye jikọrọ otu Soviet.
The above Cold War cases on South Africa and the DRC, and on many other fronts in Africa, caused enormous political and socioeconomic damage to the continent.

The end of the Cold War put the world in a new, positive direction.	Ọgwụgwụ nke Agha Nzuzo butere ụwa ụzọ ọhụrụ, nke ziri ezi .
A more cooperative world led by the US.	Morewa na-arụkọ ọrụ ọnụ nke US na-eduzi .
The results of the formation of this new world were astonishingly a boon for human progress.	Nsonaazụ nguzobe nke ụwa ọhụrụ a bụ ihe ịtụnanya maka ọganihu mmadụ.

As the menu arrived, so did about three waiters, circling for no reason, with one making as if she wanted to serve tea, all the while peeking into our phones.	Ka nri ahụ bịarutere, ihe dịka mmadụ atọ na - echere anyị, na - agbagharị n'enweghị ihe kpatara ya, otu na - eme ka a ga - asị na ọ chọrọ inye tii, oge niile na - eleba anya na ekwentị anyị.
The Wait	Nche ahụ
As we awaited our moderately-priced fried rice and spaghetti, we made small talk, sipping the tea.	Ka anyị na-eche osikapa anyị na eghe eghe, anyi kwuru obere okwu, na-añụ tii .
By now, apart from the waiters who looked aloof and were now stationed at strategic points in the restaurant, the stern-looking Chinese lady behind the counter was now sitting close by in the restaurant.	Ka ọ dị ugbu a, ewezuga ndị na-eche nche na-ele anya ma nọrọ n'akụkụ ebe a na-echekwa oriri n'ụlọ oriri ahụ, nwanyị China ahụ na-ele anya n'azụ ebe ọ nọ ọdụ n'akụkụ nri.
She beckoned to another lady (Chinese) and spoke something to her in their language, while motioning at us.	Ọ bekuru nwanyị ọzọ (onye China) wee gwa ya okwu n'asụsụ ha, mgbe anyị na-emegharị anyị .
The new lady in the most inconspicuous manner (even for an amateur) started taking photos of us and recording.	Nwaanyị ọhụụ na - enweghị atụ (ọbụlagodi onye na-amụ amụ) bidoro n'ese anyị foto na ndekọ .
I caught her glance and she tried to look away while concealing her phone.	Ahụrụ m ya ile ma ọ nwara ilepụ anya ka ọ na-ezo ekwentị ya .
Sigh.	Maa usu.
We continued to have conversations and our food began to arrive, the Chinese fried rice first.	Anyị gara n'ihu na-enwe mkparịta ụka ka ebutere nri, osikapa e ghere eghe nke China bịara na mbụ.
In a bid to what I perceive as remedying our awkward 'glance lock', 'Camera lady' approached our table and offered to teach us how to use chopsticks.	N'ịgbaso ihe m chọpụtara dị ka idozi 'mkpọchi nlegharị anya' anyị, 'Nwanyị igwe foto' bịakwutere tebụl anyị ma kwee nkwa ịkụziri anyị otu esi eji osisi eje eri nri.
Please note: while I was preoccupied with documenting our experience with a secret recorder, the team noticed that the two Asian men who were seated and had made their orders 'looked disgusted, got up and made their way into one of the many rooms' in the restaurant.	Biko detuo: mgbe m na-echekwa banyere ihe ndekọ banyere ahụmịhe anyị na onye na-edekọ ihe nzuzo, ndị otu ahụ chọpụtara na ụmụ nwoke abụọ Eshia nọ ọdụ ma mee ihu ha 'na-asọ oyi, bilitere ma banye n'otu n'ime ọtụtụ ụlọ' n'ụlọ oriri
The Show Must Go On	Ihe nkiri a ga-agariri n'ihu
And so it began, the overly choreographed friendliness, niceness, half-smiles and forced response to questions.	Ya mere, ọ malitere, oke ọrụ ọbụbụenyi a na-eme, ka ọdịmma, ịmụmụ ọnụ ọchị na ịmanye azịza ajụjụ .
Ya ya (camera lady) was now tutoring us on how to use the chopsticks.	eh eh (nwanyị igwe foto) na - akụzịrị anyị ugbua etu esi eji osisi nri .
A member of the team quickly requested a selfie and with concealed reluctance, she proceeded and everyone was obliged, including me.	Otu onye so n'òtù ahụ rịọrọ maka ise foto ngwa ngwa wee zilaga ya, ọ gara n'ihu, iwu ji onye ọ bụla, tinyere mụ onwe m.
I wondered if they took selfies with all their guests or if it was a curated PR move?	Anọ m na-eche ma ha na ndị ọbịa ha niile ọ na-esekọ foto ka ọ bụ ọ bụrụ na ọ bụ ihe nlegharị anya nke PR ?
 Soon after, we had to leave and requested takeaway packs for what was left off our spaghetti and fried rice (God forbid it wastes).	N'oge na-adịghị anya ka nke ahụ gasịrị, anyị ga-apụ ma rịọ maka ngwugwu maka ihe fọdụ spaghetti anyị na osikapa e ghere eghe (Chineke ajụ ka ha laa n'iyi) .
As we were about to leave, a woman clad in black (Chinese) appeared from one of the many doors.	Ka anyị na-achọ ịpụ, otu nwanyị nwanyị yi akwa ojii (onye Cjina) pụtara site n'otu n'ime ọtụtụ ụzọ.
She walked up to us and said 'hello' and stayed there.	Ọ rutere anyị nso ma sị 'ndewo' ma nọrọ ebe ahụ .
A member of the team asked for her name and she said Si Si and introduced herself as the manager of the place.	Otu onye so n'òtù egwuregwu ahụ rịọrọ maka aha ya ma ọ sị Si Si ma gosipụta onwe ya dị ka onye na-elekọta ebe ahụ .
One member of the team queried if 'everyone is welcome here?	Otu onye otu ha jụrụ ajụjụ ma 'a na-anabata mmadu niile ebe a?' nke o kwuru, sị 'ee'.
' to which she simply said 'yes'.	Ọ gara soro anyị pụọ n'ọnụ ụzọ (ọzọ, kedu ntọala onye ọrụ ya hụrụ ndị ahịa ruo n'ọnụ ụzọ ahụ?) .
She then proceeded to accompanying us out the front door (again, what establishment has its manager see customers to the door?	Ka anyị na-apụ n'ụlọ ahụ, ahụrụ m onye nche ọ dịka ọ bụ onye Naịjirịa n'anya ya dị ka ụjọ ọna-atụ ya .
As we exited the building, I noticed the security guard (seemed like a Nigerian from his looks) looked jittery.	Apụghị m ịhapụ ya, n'ihi ya, m laghachịrị wee see foto n'ihu ụlọ ahụ .
I couldn't let it go, so I went back to take a photo in front of the building.	Kedu otu ọzọ anyị ga-esi gosi na anyị bịara iri spaghetti ịkpa oke?
How else would we prove we came to eat racist spaghetti?	Ọ bụrụ na onye nlekọta ahụ si na windo nkụwa ahụ na-ele anyị m kọwara na mbụ; ọ tụghị anya na anyị ga-alaghachi na mberede maka foto.
It turned out the manager was watching from the glass window I described earlier; she hadn't anticipated our abrupt return for a photo.	Ihe ndị ọzọ na-enyo enyo bụ onye na-eche nche, bụ onye tụrụ alo ka m jiri mgbidi nwere ụfọdụ ifuru see foto ahụ ka m ghara iguzo n'akụkụ ọnụ ụzọ nke nwere aha ntọala ahụ akpụrụ na ya.
More suspicious was the security guard, who suggested I use a wall with some flower pots for the photo as opposed to standing by the entrance which had the name of the establishment carved into it.	Na njedebe
From our findings, interaction with staff and management, we couln't help thinking that Shi Shi resturant is indeed racist, hence the security guard's inquiry about who we were looking for in a place listed as a public restaurant even on Google.	Site na nchoputa anyi, nmekorita nlekọta na ndị ọrụ, enweghị ike iche ihe ọzọ na-abụghị na ụlọ oriri Shi Shi bụ ihe agbụrụ, ya mere ajụjụ ndị nche banyere onye anyị choro bịa na ebe edepụtara dika ụlọ nri ọnọdụ ọbụla na Google .
There was also the issue of the staff recording a video of us, the policing while in the restaurant and the manager accompanying us out.	Enwekwara esemokwu nke ndị ọrụ na-esekọ ihe nkiri anyị, ọrụ uwe ojii mgbe anyị na-eri nri na onye njikwa anyị na-eso anyị pụọ .
Would they have done all that if we were Chinese?	Ha gaara eme ihe niile ma ọ bụrụ na anyị bụ ndị China?
In the restaurant's bid to gloss this over, it ended us awarding us an exaggerated reception.	N'agba nke ụlọ oriri ahụ iji mee ka e kpuchie omume ha, ha nyere anyị nnukwu nnabata .

Indeed, the funding that has so far been utilised by Anambra to carry out its impact assessment studies and other relevant exercises considered important to assessing the project have come from the state Government.

CRIMINALISE BUSH FIRES NOW -- LIVESTOCK FARMER	MEBIE IWU ỊGBA ỌHỊA ỌKỤ UGBU A - NDỊ ỌRỤ UGBO 
Dr Ugochukwu Okpalaeke, Managing Director (MD) Eagle Food Processing Industry Ltd., has called on government at all levels to criminalise bush fires to save forest reserves in the state.

Dr Okpalaeke said that bush fires constituted sabotage against governments at all levels.	Dr Okpalaeke kwuru na ọhịa ịgba ọkụ bụ mmebi iwu megide gọọmentị n'ọkwa niile.
This is a matter that should be treated with dispatch.	Nke a bụ okwu e kwesiri itinye ọnụ na ya ozigbo.

According to him in the process they only succeed in destroying forest reserves and their habitats.	Dịka o kwuru, ha na-aga n'ihu ibibi oke ọhịa na ebe obibi ha.
When fires destroy bush, the nutrients in the land, animals, birds and insects that cross fertilize plants are also destroyed in the process; this also results into poor harvests of crops, high mortality rate among animals, with hunger as another direct consequence.	'Mgbe ọhịa gbara ọkụ, ọ na-emebi ihe ndị na-enye nri dị n’ime ala, ụmụanụmanụ, ụmụ nnụnụ na ụmụahụhụ nke na-enyere ahịhịa/osisi aka ito; nke a na-ebute owuwe ihe ubi adịghị mma, ọnụọgụgụ ọnwụ dị elu nke ụmụanụmanụ, na agụụ.

According to him, it is an ill wind that blows no one any good, calling on the media especially radio and television to develop jingles to sensitise the general public on dangers of bush fires.	Dịka o si kwuo, ọ bụ ihe dị njọ na-emetụta onye ọbụla, na-akpọ oku na mgbasa ozi ọkachasị redio na televishọn ka ha gbasaa ozi iji mee ka ọha na eze mara ihe egwu dị n'ịgba ọhịa ọkụ.

The MD said that since December 2019 to date, he lost nine native cows (Efi Igbo) as a result of bush fires that cleared all vegetations around his ranch.	Nke MD kwuru na kemgbe ọnwa Disemba afọ 2019 ruo taa, na ehi Igbo itoolu funahụrụ ya n'ihi ọkụ ọgbụgba nke kpochapụrụ ahịhịa niile dị na gburugburu ya.
The Efi Hausa is survives it because they eat prepared animal feeds while Efi Igbo finds it difficult to survive as feed mainly on green leaves,' he said.

Dariye was lachrymal, wiping hot tears from his eyes.	Dariye bu anyammiri, were na-ehichasị anyammiri ya n'anya.
Before the senator was handed a 14-year jail sentence by Adebukola Banjoko, the presiding judge, he begged for mercy – a luxury he did not accord to the people of Plateau who endured his troubled administration.	Tupu e nyefee Sịnetị ahụ akwụkwọ mkpọrọ afọ iri na anọ, Adebukola Banjoko, onye ọkaikpe n'ụlọ mkpọrọ, rịọrọ ka e meere ya ebere - okomoko o nyeghị ndị bi na Plateau onye nagidere nsogbu ọchịchị ya.
He was found guilty of 14 counts out of the 23 preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.	A mara ya ikpe ugboro iri na anọ n'ime iri abụọ na atọ ahụ Kọmitii na-ahụ maka ego na mmefu ego (EFCC) kpebiiri ya.
Before the judge passed her judgment, Paul Eroko, counsel to Dariye, pleaded for a light sentence.	Tupu onye ọkaikpe ahụ kpebie ikpe ya, Paul Eroko, onye ndụmọdụ Dariye, rịọrọ ka a maa ya ikpe dị mfe.
'Appeals to your judgement do not succeed; we will fall on your mercy. The prisons are congested,' Eroko said.	“Arịrịọ a na-arịọ ka ikpe gị ghara ịga nke ọma; anyị ga-emere gị ebere. Ụlọ mkpọrọ ahụ ejula.' Eroko kwuru. 
'They misled the governor, it is the bank; they said he didn't have to present anything.'	“Ha duhiere gọvanọ, ọ bụ ndị ụlọakụ; ha kwuru na ọ dịghị mkpa iwepụta ihe ọbụla.”
But Rotimi Jacobs, counsel to the EFCC, said Dariye did not deserve a light sentence because he 'did not show remorse'.	Mana Rotimi Jacobs, onye ndụmọdụ na EFCC, kwuru na Dariye ekwesighi inweta amamikpe dị mfe n'ihi na “o gosighi mmụọ nchegharị”.
At this point, weeping Dariye said he wanted to speak.	N'oge a, Dariye onye nke na-ébé ákwa kwuru na ya chọrọ ikwu okwu.
'Have mercy, you are a Christian, your name is Jacob,' he said.	“Mee ebere, ị bụ onye ụka, aha gị bụ Jekọb,” o kwuru.
On Thursday, Orji Uzor Kalu, another former governor and senator, received the retribution of kismet.	Na Tọzdee, Orji Uzor Kalu, onye bụbu gọvanọ na sinetọ, natara nkwụghachi nke kismet.
Reality jarred Kalu out of the fantasy that he was going home to his bed after his conviction for money laundering by a federal high court in Lagos.	Eziokwu gbochiri Kalu n'echiche efu na ọ na-ala n'ụlọ ya mgbe o kwenyesịrị ikpe maka ego zuuru n' ụlọ ikpe dị elu na Lagos.
After Mohammad Idris, the presiding judge, pronounced a 12-year jail sentence and warders moved towards him with handcuffs, the Senate Chief Whip resorted to diplomacy.	Dịka Mohammad Idris mesịrị, ọkaikpe ahụ kpọpụtara, afọ iri na abụọ nke ịtụ mkpọrọ ma ndị nche mkpọrọ ahụ lutere ya na tụọ ya ịga n'aka, onyeisi Sịnetị maliteghachiri diplọma.
'Where are you taking us to now? Please don't handcuff me. I will follow you,' he said.	“Ebee ka ị na-akpọga anyị ugbu a? Biko atụkwala m ịga n'aka. Aga m eso gị,” o kwuru.
Kalu's fall is louder than the crash of Jericho – being a trenchant mouthpiece of President Muhammadu Buhari in the South-East.	Ọdịda Kalu dara karịrị ọdịda mgbidi nke Jeriko - dịka onye bụ nkwupụta okwu nzuzo nke onyeisi ala Muhammadu Buhari na South-East.
But is his conviction a 'pass mark' for Buhari's much vaunted war against corruption? I do not think so.	Mana nkwenye ya, o ruru 'akara' maka agha dị oke egwu Buhari megide mpụ? Echeghị m otu ahụ.
First, the case is 12 years old. It was not actuated by this administration. And investigations were already concluded before this regime.	Nke mbu, ikpe ahụ gbara afọ iri na abụọ. Ndi ọchịchị a emeghi ya. E mechaala nyochaa ya tupu ọchịchị a.
Second, corruption cases recently initiated against certain individuals have not received oomph owing to the fact that they are in the 'Buhari fraternity'.	Nke abụọ, ikpe nrụrụ aka ebidola megide ụfọdụ mmadụ anabataghị 'oomph' n'ihi na ha nọ n' ọchịchị 'Buhari.'
For example, the case of Babachir Lawal, former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, is sputtering in court this despite his indictment by the government he served.	Ịmaatụ, okwu gbasara Babachir Lawal, onye bụbu onye ode akwụkwọ gọọmentị etiti, na-asọgharị n'ụlọ ikpe n'agbanyeghị ịma ikpe nke gọọmentị mere.
Also, there is a petition against Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the APC, for alleged money laundering at the EFCC. Tinubu admitted transporting cash in bullion vans on the eve of the 2019 election to his house. But the anti-graft agency has not moved a muscle to investigate the allegation.	Ọzọkwa, e nwere akwụkwọ mkpesa megide Bola Tinubu, Onye ndú nke APC maka ịdọrọ ego na EFCC. Tinubu kwenyere na o ji ụgbọala na-ebuga ego na mgbede ntuli aka nke 2019 n'ụlọ ya. Mana ụlọ ọrụ na-ahụ maka nke a amalitebeghi inyocha ebubo a.
When Ibrahim Magu, acting EFCC chairman, was asked about the petition against Jagaban by a journalist, he snubbed the inquiry, and said 'next question, please?'	mgbe a jụrụ onye na-elekọta otu EFCC bụ Ibrahim Magu ajụjụ maka arịrịọ onye ntaakụkọ rịọchitere Jagaban, ọ gbara ha nkịtị ma jụọ ha 'ajụjụ ọzọ, biko? '
As a matter of fact, there are other members of the APC and those in the Buhari fraternity who have corruption allegations hanging on their necks, but the EFCC is yet to crack up a case against them.	N'ezie, e nwere ndị otu APC na ndị na-enye Buhari nkwado bụ ndị aka ha dị n'aghụghọ, mana ndị EFCC ebidobeghi ime nnyocha ha.
I will not mention more names.	Agaghị m ekwu áhà ọzọ.
So, on what grounds should Buhari's anti-corruption war be toasted? If the regime is applauded for the jailing of Dariye and Orji Kalu, how about other cases it has failed to take up or conclude?	Yabụ, kedu ihe kpatara e kwesịrị ịtụkwasị agha Buhari na-ebu maka nrụrụaka obi? Ọ bụrụ na a na-eto gọọmentị maka mkpọrọ ọ tụrụ Dariye na Orji Kalu, kedu maka ikpe ndị ọzọ ọ dara mba ikwulite maọbụ kwubie?
The fact is, Buhari's anti-corruption war is still selective. And as Abubakar Tsav, former Lagos police commissioner, said, 'It has no impact on Nigerians.'	Eziokwu bụ, agha Buhari megidere nrụrụaka ka na-ahọta. Dịkwa ka Abubakar Tsav, onye bụbu onyeisi ndị uwe ojii (kọmịshọna) na Lagos kwuru, “Ọ nweghị ihe mmetụta ọbụla n'ebe ndị Naịjirịa nọ.”
However, I will commend the judiciary for not bending despite influences to have some cases of corruption compromised. The termination of Kalu's 12-year-old bout at the trial court is a big point for the institution. The hero here is this arm of government.	Otu o sila dị, a ga m aja ndị ụlọ ikpe ike maka na ha alaghachighị azụ n'okwu ha n’agbanyeghi ikike imegharị nrụrụaka ahụ. Nkagbu afọ iri na abụọ a kagbuuru Kalu n'ụlọ ikpe bụ nnukwu ihe maka ụlọ ọrụ ahụ. N'ébé a, dike bụ ogwe gọọmentị a.
But beyond this feat, we must look into another tragic offence against Nigerians. Why is a senator convicted of fraud still receiving allowances and salaries as a member of the Senate?	E mesịa, anyị ga-elebanye anya na iwu ọzọ jọgburu onwe ya megide ndị Naijirịa. Gịnị kpatara na onye omeiwu amara ikpe ígwù wàyó ka na-anata ụgwọ ọrụ na ụgwọ ọnwa dịka onye otu omeiwu?
As of December 2018, Dariye was paid N85.5m in prison, and as of May 2019 his allowances had risen to N171m. Obviously, the same immoral privilege will be accorded to Orji Kalu. Is this not troubling?	N'ọnwa Disemba 2018, a kwụrụ Dariye ụgwọ N85.5m n'ụlọ mkpọrọ, wee rue na May 2019, ụgwọ mmachi akpa ya agbagola N171m. N'ụzọ doro anya, a ga-enye Orji Kalu otu ikike a rụrụ arụ. Nke a ọ bụghị nsogbu?
What it means is that tax-payers will continue to fund the lifestyles of individuals who have been convicted of stealing from them.	Ihe ọ pụtara bụ na ndị na-atụ ụtụ isi ga-aga n'ihu na-akwado ndị ahụ a mara ikpe na ha zuru ọha na eze ohi.
Justice is not final when people, who have been declared vandals of the public purse, are still maintained by public money.	Ikpe ziri ezi abụghị ikpe mgbe ndị mmadụ, bụ ndị e kwupụtara na ha zuru ohi dị iche iche n’ihu ọha, ka na-ejide ego ọha na eze.

Banking Sector's Loss Is Entertainment Industry's Gain	Ọghọm ndị ụlọakụ bụ uru ndị ụlọ ntụrụndụ 
The entertainment industry is emerging as the market that will absorbmuch of the loans the central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is forcingcommercial banks to give.	Ụlọ ọrụ na-ahụ maka mmemme na-apụta dịka ahịa nke ga-anara mgbazinye ego nke Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) na-amanye ndị ụlọ akụ inye.

However, analysts Sahara Reporters have spoken to and reports published by financial research firms, conclude that the increasedpressure on banks to lend much of their deposit, is negative for thefinance industry at this point.

Adedayo Bakare, an analyst with Afrinvest gave Sahara Reporters a similar outlook.	Adedayo Bakare, onye nnyocha na Afrinvest nyere ndị Sahara Report echiche yiri nke ha.
True to Bakare's observation, two of the three-tier 1 lenders, Zenith and Guarantee Trust, are among the 12 lenders fined a combined total of over N499bn by the CBN for their inability to meet with the September 2019 target of borrowing 60 percent of their deposits to thereal sector.

Proshare is of the opinion that these lenders have looked to thesafety of the celebrity industry, to reduce the risk of borrowingfunds to the everyday farmer and small-time shoemaker.	Proshare kwuru na ndị a na-agbazi ego lebara anya n'ụlọ ọrụ a ma ama, iji belata nsogbu ibinye ndị ọrụ ugbo ego.

The most audacious plan is Access bank's Creative Arts village in Ogun State.	Atụmatụ kachasị mma bụ nke ndị ụlọ akụ Access mere n'Ogun steeti.

We must not forget the reverberating cry of Ernesto Che Guevera to with 'If you tremble with indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine' it is this that spur true patriots on an eternal vigil as the vanguards for justice and equity for all.	Anyị agaghị echezọ mkpu ákwá Ernesto Che Guevera na ' Ọ bụrụ na ị wee iwe n'ihi ikpe na-ezighị ezi ọbụla, ị bụ onye otu m'.

From the very origins and cradle of humanity, injustice has always reared its ugly head to crush and oppress those perceived to be of less social standing and thus the fight for justice has raged on through the ages.	Site na nzụlite na nkata nke mmadụ, ikpe e zighi ezi bụ ihe na-emegbu ndị e lere anya dịka ndị ọnụ erughi n'okwu ma mgba a na-agbara ikpe ziri ezi malitere kemgbe ụwa.
Little wonder the immortal words of Benjamin Franklin remain as empirically practicable today as it was decades ago when he muttered them and even before the words found life from his oscillating tongue centuries back.	Ka a sịkwa ihe mere na okwu Benjamin Franklin adịghị anwụ anwu dịka ọ mere ọtụtụ iri afọ gara aga mgbe ọ kwupụtara ha.
These pricking words are the prods that guide us today as we cry out for impartial justice for Abubakar Musa Abubakar who is being persecuted consistently by Alhaji Sani Dauda (ASD), former Chairman of Peugeot Automobile Nigeria Limited.	Okwu ndị a bụ ihe na-eduzi anyị taa dịka anyị tiri mkpu maka ikpe Abubakar Musa Abubakar, bụ onye Alhaji Sani Dauda (ASD), onyeisi oche 'Peugeot Automobile Nigeria Limited' na-akpagbu mgbe niile. 
In the Nigeria of yesteryears opulent individual like ASD lorded over others like a czar of a medieval fiefdom; having their wishes, whims and caprices foisted on the generality of the people. 	Na Naịjiria n'oge ochie, ndị ji ego dịka ASD na-eme ihe ike karịa ndị ọzọ dịka inweta ihe ha chọrọ, izugbe ndị mmadụ ime ihe.
This was indeed a dark and gloomy period when he and his ilk had their words as laws and any attempt to challenge or oppose their ambition would be seen as a sacrilege with a resultant mobilization of their foot soldiers to bully, coarse, harass, intimidate and humiliate those who dared to oppose them.	Nke a bụ mgbe ya na ụdị ya mere okwu ya dịka iwu, na mbọ ọbụla a gbara iji megide ebumnuche ha ka a ga-ahụ ihe dị nsọ ma kwanye ndị agha iji megbuo, yie egwu, menye ụjọ ma mee ndị na-emegide ha ihe ihere.
In these repugnant dark days, it was believed that some rogue law enforcement agents, compromised media influencers and corrupt judges were whispered to be on his payroll and always willing to do his bidding.

Though the businessman still wallows in the euphoria of the past, but what he has failed to realize is that the ground has shifted beneath him, and that in the New Nigeria of today no one is above the law.

In the lines of the ancient adage, 'A leopard never changes its spots' and so true for ASD's apparent impunity which has remerged in this recent episode hence the resort to contempt of Court and judicial abuse all in a bid to placate his daughter Nasiba Sani Dauda, shield his Son Shehu Sani Dauda, a sharia court Judge Alkali Murtala Nasir Al-Misiry and one Abdullahi Kaloma.	N'ahịrị nke usoro okwu mgbe ochie, 'Agụ owuru anaghị agbanwe agwa ya', ọ bụ eziokwu maka nnabata pụtara ìhè nke ASD nke jupụtara n'ihe e mere n'oge gara aga, n'ihi nke a, na-eleda ụlọ ikpe anya, ikpe ikpe iji chụọ nwa ya nwaanyị bụ Nasiba Sani Dauda, kpuchie nwa ya nwoke bụ Shehu Sani Dauda, onye ọkaikpe Sharia Alkali Murtala Nasir Al-Misiry na otu onye, Abdullahi Kaloma.
Together, they jointly committed criminal conspiracy, abetment of an offence, criminal assault, wrongful confinement and restraint, false imprisonment, voluntary causing of harm, enticement of a married woman, bigamy, re-marriage with concealment of former marriage in defiance of an existing judgment of the Kawo Upper Sharia Court, Kaduna in a case between Abubakar Musa Abubakar Vs. Nasiba Sani Dauda contrary to sections 45, 46, 58, 217, 229, 230, 239, 365, 366 and 369 respectively of the panel code law of Kaduna State, Nigeria.	Ha jikọrọ ọnụ mee mpụ, mwepụ nke imebi iwu, njide ezighi ezi, mkpọrọ ụgha, ịkpata mmerụ ahụ, ịlụgharị di na nwunye na nkwụsị ikpe dị adị n'ụlọ ikpe ukwuu nke Kawo Sharia, Kaduna n'ikpe dị n'etiti Abubakar Musa Abubakar na Nasiba Sani Dauda nke megidere ngalaba 45, 46, 58, 217, 229, 230, 239, 365, 366 na 369 n'usoro iwu nke Kaduna steeti, Naịjiria. 
As one would expect that his recent entanglement with Abubakar Musa Abubakar a supposed son-in-law is nothing new and certainly he is not likely going to be the last person to undergo such a harrowing experience from irresponsible prying except the businessman is stopped in his tracks by the grilling mechanism of justice.	Dịka mmadụ ga-atụ anya na mmekọ ya na Abubakar Musa Abubakar onye nwere ike ịbụ ọgọ ya nwoke abụghị ihe ọhụụ ma ọ gaghị abụ onye ikpeazụ ga-anagide n'ihe ọjọọ dị otu a site na enweghi amamihe beelụsọ ma a ga-akwụsị onye ọchụnta ego ime ihe n'usoro nkwụmọtọ.
Now, the same scenario is being re-enacted with Abubakar Musa Abubakar, who married Nasiba Sani Dauda on the 24th December, 2016.	Ugbu a, a na-enyochaghachi ọnọdụ ahụ ya na Abubakar Musa Abubakar, onye lụrụ Nasiba Sani Dauda n'àbàlị̀ iri abụọ na anọ nke ọnwa Disemba, 2016.
It will be recalled that the marriage started on the foundation of love, peace and harmony until few months into the marriage when the father of Nasiba - Alhaji Sani Dauda - began undue interference in the family affairs of the couple on a daily basis and subsequently instructed his daughter against her will to abscond from the marriage for reasons not yet clear to discerning minds.	A ga-echeta na alụmdi a bidoro na ntọala nke ịhụnanya, udo na nkwekọrịta ruo ọnwa ole na ole a banyere na alụmdi mgbe nna Nasiba - Alhaji Sani Dauda - malitere itinye anya n'okwu ezinụlọ ahụ kwa ụbọchị ma mesịa gwa nwa ya nwaanyị ka ọ ghara ịlụ di ahụ n'ihi ebumnuche na-edobeghị anya.
All entreaties to ASD to return Nasiba to her matrimonial home fell on deaf ears, but he instead forced Nasiba to institute a case of Khul' (request for divorce) before Grade 1 Sharia Court, Tudun Wada, Kaduna where a controversial judgment was obtained and a dissolution of the marriage was pronounced without recourse to principles of nemo iudex in causa sua and audi alteram partem to the concerned parties.	Arịrịọ a rịọrọ ASD ka ọ laghachi Nasiba n'alụmdi na nwunye ya kpụrụ afọ n'ala, mana ọ manyere Nasiba ka o guzobe okwu nke Khul (arịrịọ maka ịgba alụkwaghịm) n'ihu ụlọ ikpe Sharia mbụ, Tudun Wada, Kaduna ebe e nwetara ikpe na-ese okwu ma kwupụta alụkwaghịm n'etiti di na nwunye ahụ na-enweghị mgbakwunye na ụkpụrụ nke 'nemo iudex in causa sua' na 'audi alteram pertem' nke metụtara ndị ahụ.
However, Abubakar Musa Abubakar not satisfied with the judgment of the lower court obtained a stay of execution order from the Upper Sharia Court, Kawo, Kaduna which was served on the respondent and subsequently appealed the travesty of justice of the lower court at the Upper Sharia Court which gave judgment in favour Abubakar Musa Abubakar by quashing and setting aside the judgment of the lower court for lacks of jurisdiction.	Agbanyeghị, Abubakar Musa Abubakar enweghị afọ ojuju na ikpe ahụ ụlọ ikpe dị ala wetara nke igbu ọchụ sitere n'ụlọ ikpe nke Sharia, Kawo, Kaduna nke e nyere onye na-azaghachi ma mechaa rịọ maka ikpe ziri ezi nke ụlọ ikpe dị ala n'ụlọ ikpe dị elu nke Sharia ebe e nyere Abubakar Musa Abubakar ikpe ahụ site n'ịsụgharị na ịwezụga ikpe nke ụlọ ikpe dị ala maka enweghị ikike.
Both the stay of execution order notice and the substantive judgment of the Upper Sharia Court were properly served on the respondent (Nasiba). It is the only prevailing judgment that exists till this day.	Ma nnọchite anya akwụkwọ e nyere maka igbu egbu na mkpebi ụlọikpe nke Sharia ukwu ka e nyere onye nzara ọnụ (Nasiba). Ọ bụ naanị ikpe a na-agbasokarị nke dị ruo taa.
The arrest and detention of Alhaji Sani Dauda and others for abetment of an offence, remarriage with marriage concealment, criminal assault among other charges goes further to show that President Muhammadu Buhari's next level agenda will not tolerate lawlessness from any quarters and that justice is truly blind but fair and balanced to all manner of people.	Njide na nnwụchi nke Alhaji Sani Dauda na ndị ọzọ maka ịda iwu, ịlụgharị di na nwunye na nzuzo, mpụ na ebubo ndị ọzọ na-aga n'ihu na-egosi na ọkwa onyeisi ala Muhammadu Buhari ọzọ agaghị agbachi mmebi iwu site n'akụkụ ọbụla.

Above all it is an affront to the judiciary, rule of law and attempt to denigrate sharia law.	N'ihe niile, ọ bụ mkparị na ngalaba ikpe, ịkwado iwu na ịnwa imebi iwu Sharia.
How can anyone who called himself Muslim marry off another man's wife?	Kedụ ka onye kpọrọ onwe ya onye Alakụba si lụta nwunye onye ọzọ?
In condemning the injustice and high handedness being propelled by ASD, let this turn of justice signal a warning knell to all that;	N'ịkatọ ikpe ezighi ezi na aka dị elu nke ASD na-akpali, ka ikpe a gosipụta ịdọ aka ná ntị na-emetụta ihe ndị ahụ;

Since the outbreak of this imbroglio and its escalation in the public domain, ASD albeit clandestinely has been sponsoring groups and individuals as face-saving measures to sell false narratives through media propaganda that portray him and his darling daughter as the victims rather than the perpetrators of this heinous crime against God and humanity.

One of such groups is Muslim Lawyers Association of Nigeria, Kaduna State Chapter, an organisation that should be neutral in a matter that involves two contending parties both of who are Muslims or at best side with the truth but instead they came out disgracefully to pitch tent with the culprits (ASD and Others) who intentionally and knowingly desecrate Islamic Sharia laid down tenets of marriage by abetting bigamy.

Man Who Staged Wedding Without Reception Reveals How He Convinced Family To Support Idea	Nwoke nke gbara akwụkwọ n’akpọghị oriri na-ekpughe otu o siri kwenye ezinaụlọ iji kwado echiche

A new groom, Adewale Yusuf, who recently shocked many Nigerians by indicating on his wedding invitation card that there would be no reception after the ceremony, has told SaharaReporters that it took him only two calls to convince his parents and other family members to buy into his idea.

He said, 'When I first informed my parents of the idea not to have a reception after my wedding ceremony, they dropped the call on me.	O kwuru, sị, “Mgbe mbụ m gwara ndị mụrụ m na agaghị akpọ oriri ọbụla mgbe m gachara akwụkwọ, ha kwụsịrị oku ahụ.
Eventually, it took me about two more calls to be able to convince them to support my idea.	“N’ikpeazụ, ọ were m ihe ugboro abụọ ọzọ iji mee ka ha kweta ịkwado echiche m.

At the end of the day, everyone appreciated my idea.'	'Na ngwụsị ụbọchị ahụ, onye ọbụla ji echiche m kpọrọ ihe.”
But despite not staging a reception at their wedding, Yusuf told SaharaReporters that many of their guests didn't return home without having something to eat.

Ministerial Clutching At Straws By Barnabas Igho	Ịchọpụta olileanya nke ndị Mịnịsta nke sitere n’aka Banabas Igho

If you are supervising an important ministry like that of communication even without the recent fancy addition of 'digital economy' to its name, and you still need a spokesperson to pen almost 2,000 words of polemics in order to project your image, then your self-inflicted trouble is just starting in my reckoning.

Before her latest outburst in the media, thoughtlessly blaming imaginary saboteurs for trying to stop her 'unstoppable boss', Uwa Suleman had issued a disconcerting diatribe in form of a press release, accusing all critical stakeholders of the ministry her principal supervises including the media, of ganging up against him because he was the 'best thing' that happened to the industry since its liberalisation in the year 2000.	Tupu óké iwe ya na mgbasa ozi, na-ata ụta n'echiche echeghị maka ịgbalị ịkwụsị 'onyeisi nchịkwa ya', Uwa Suleman ewepụtala ekwumekwu na-akatọ mmadụ n'ụdị mgbasa ozi, na-ebo ndị ụlọọrụ Mịnịstrị ahụ gụnyere ndị mgbasa ozi, banyere ịkpa nkata megide ya n'ihi na ọ bụ 'ihe kachasị mma' nke meere ụlọọrụ ahụ kemgbe ọnụnọ ya n'afọ 2000.
This prompted ripostes of some respected columnists like Mr Sanya Oni of The Nation newspaper, who eloquently summed up the minister's tragedy as a case of exaggerated notion of the office that he occupies as 'he obviously didn't think that his remit stops at formulating and implementing policies for the digital economy; as he wants to play the regulator'.

Since his assuming office in August this year, Mr Pantami has indeed found it difficult to adjust from the regulatory role he used to enjoy at National Information Technology Development Agency to his new titular position as per regulating the industry is concerned, and his unconstitutional attempts to dabble into it has invited the resistance of major actors in the industry like Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria as well as that of the Association of Telecoms Companies of Nigeria.	Kemgbe ọ malitere ọkwá n'ọnwa Ọgọst afọ a, Maazị Pantami achọpụtala na o siri ike ịgbanwe ọrụ nchịkwa o jibu n'ụlọ ọrụ 'National Information Technology Development Agency' na ọkwa ọhụrụ ya, na ịgba mbọ ya o sonyere nke ịkpọ oku nguzogide nke ndị isi ụlọ ọrụ ahụ dịka 'Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria' yana nke 'Association of Telecoms of Nigeria.' 
Coming back to Uwa's latest invectives however, there are some fundamental half-truths she raised in her slay-queen styled article, like ridiculous claim that South Africa and other countries are busy copying and pasting the minister's example of his failed data price reduction directive.	Na-alaghachi na okwu ọjọọ Uwa kwuru, e nwere ụfọdụ eziokwu nke o welitere n'edemede ya, dịka mkparị na-ekwu na South Africa na mba ndị ọzọ nọ na-arụsi ọrụ ike iwere ihe ịmaatụ nke minista ahụ banyere mbenata ọnụahịa 'data'.
While this, to say the least, is very disrespectful to the authorities in South Africa, who have never impliedly referred to Nigeria in taking their decisions, it's obviously not the actual representation of the truth of the matter.	Ebe nke a, akwanyeghị ndị ọchịchị nọ na South Africa ugwu, bụ ndị ezigabeghị Naịjiria na mkpebi ha, o doro anya na ọ bụghị ihe nnọchite nke eziokwu okwu ahụ.
Someone should wake Uwa up and hand over a mug of coffee to her together with the contrasting news of India's example that hiked data prices to as much as 40 per cent.	Mmadụ kwesịrị ịkpọte Uwa ma nyefee ya iko kọfị ma kọọ akụkọ dị iche iche banyere etu ndị India si mee ka ọnụ ahịa ruo pasenti iri anọ.
We don't know how this is ignored as a copy and pasting of what the policy of the man she obsequiously describes in ludicrous adjectives that late Idi Amin of Uganda would have rejected.	Anyị amataghị etu e si leghara nke a anya ma gosipụta ihe iwu banyere nwoke ọ kọwara n'ụzọ ọjọọ na Idi Amin nke Uganda gaara ịjụ.
To cut the story short, India used to enjoy the cheapest data in the world, but the industry could no longer sustain it without risking losing in further investment to support the telecom infrastructure in the country.	Iji bie akụkọ a nkenke, India na-enwebu 'data' adịbughị ọnụ n'ụwa, mana ụlọ ọrụ ahụ enweghị ike ịkwado ya na-etinyekwughi ego iji kwado akụrụngwa telecom na mba ahụ.

Still, what Uwa hasn't told us was that South Africa used to be among the top three in terms of the cost of data and even with 50 per cent reduction, it wouldn't come down to the level of Nigeria despite the fact that the challenges the telcos face and cost of production in Nigeria are clearly on a different scale.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ihe Uwa agwabeghị anyị bụ na South Africa na-anọkarị n'etiti ndị atọ kachasị elu n'ihe gbasara ọnụahịa 'data' yana n'agbanyeghị mbelata pasenti iri ise, ọ gaghị agbadata n'ọkwa nke Naịjiria n'agbanyeghị ihe ịma aka chere 'telcos' ihu na ọnụahịa mmepụta na Naịjirịa dị iche.
Even on the strength of TheCable report that Pantami quoted in the past, it put Nigeria and South Africa, with the average of $2.22 and $7.19 per 1GB respectively.	N'agbanyeghị akụkọ ndị otu 'Cable' nke kwuru na Pantami n'oge gara aga, tinyere Naịjiria na South Africa, were nwee ihe nkezi $2.22 na $7.19 kwa 1GB n'otu n'otu.
And one can forgive Uwa for her poor grasp of the issue as she embarrassingly attributed the directive in South Africa to the country's telecom regulator, while a little search on Google on the matter would have told her that the decision emanated from South Africa Competition Regulatory Authority, not the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa and the decision must have been scientifically based, not jejune subjective populist directive.	Mmadụ pụrụ ịgbaghara Uwa maka amaghị ihe na ihe ọmụma a dị na South Africa dị n’aka onyeisi ndị 'telecom', ebe obere ihe ọchịchọ n’igwe 'Google' banyere okwu a gaala agwa ya na mkpebi a sitere n'iwu asọmpi nke South Africa a kpọrọ 'South Africa Competition Regulatory Authority', na ọ bụghị Independent Communications Authority of South Africa na mkpebi ahụ kwesiri idabere na sayensị. 
But such kinds of faux pas are understandable as Uwa and co in the new mandate are trying to learn the rope.	Mana ụdị ọnọdụ a ka a ga-aghọta dị ka Uwa na ndị ọzọ n'iwu ọhụrụ ahụ na-anwa ịmụta ya.
And they should be reminded of the fact that before their arrival on the scene, the industry had already matured.	Ha kwesiri ka e chetara ha na tupu ha abịa ebe a, ndị ọrụ ahụ adịrịla.
There were over 70 million Nigerians on the high-speed Internet, millions of active subscriber base as well as numerous sensational story in the industry, which has been on this sustained trajectory for long.

Hence, accusing both the providers and regulator of connivance is not only reckless but cheap as both the stakeholders collaboratively built the industry from the scratch.	N'ihi ya, ibo ma ndị na-eweta ya na ndị na-achịkwa nkwekọrịta abụghị naanị ihe enweghị isi kama ọ dị ọnụ ala ebe ndị ọrụ mpaghara ahụ rụkọtara ọrụ ọnụ wee rụpụta ụlọ ọrụ ahụ.

It's not too late for the minister however, to curb himself of this seduction to 'populism' and court the important stakeholders of the ministry by beginning to put the cart before the horse – addressing industry issues – if he wants to succeed.	Oge agabeghị minista a igbochi onwe ya n'ụdị ndọrọndọrọ ọchịchị a ma rịọ ndị ọrụ ozi dị mkpa n'ụlọ ọrụ ahụ - na-akọwa okwu metụtara ụlọ ọrụ a - ma ọ bụrụ na ọ chọrọ ime nke ọma.

If Mr Pantami wants to succeed, he needs all the regulators and operators on his side, and he can't achieve that by constantly pitching them against the consumers thereby making his narcissistic self-good and everybody that has contributed to the development of the industry bad.

Even on the strength of TheCable report that Pantami quoted in the past, it put Nigeria and South Africa, with the average of $2.22 and $7.19 per 1GB respectively.

And one can forgive Uwa for her poor grasp of the issue as she embarrassingly attributed the directive in South Africa to the country's telecom regulator, while a little search on Google on the matter would have told her that the decision emanated from South Africa Competition Regulatory Authority, not the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa and the decision must have been scientifically based, not jejune subjective populist directive.	Mmadụ pụrụ ịgbaghara Uwa maka amaghị ihe na ihe ọmụma a dị na South Africa dị n’aka onyeisi ndị 'telecom', ebe obere ihe ọchịchọ n’igwe 'Google' banyere okwu a gaala agwa ya na mkpebi a sitere n'iwu asọmpi nke South Africa a kpọrọ 'South Africa Competition Regulatory Authority', na ọ bụghị Independent Communications Authority of South Africa na mkpebi ahụ kwesiri idabere na sayensị. 
But such kinds of faux pas are understandable as Uwa and co in the new mandate are trying to learn the rope.	Mana ụdị ọnọdụ a ka a ga-aghọta dị ka Uwa na ndị ọzọ n'iwu ọhụrụ ahụ na-anwa ịmụta ya.

Hence, accusing both the providers and regulator of connivance is not only reckless but cheap as both the stakeholders collaboratively built the industry from the scratch.

It's not too late for the minister however, to curb himself of this seduction to 'populism' and court the important stakeholders of the ministry by beginning to put the cart before the horse – addressing industry issues – if he wants to succeed.

On getting to the place, the mob saw the mad man making a call with a phone and upon sighting the people, he immediately threw the phone into a nearby river.

When the news of the ABU student's suicide made headlines, most Nigerians condemned the act.	Mgbe akụkọ banyere nwa akwụkwọ ABU gburu onwe ya dị n'isi akụkọ, ọtụtụ ndị Naịjiria katọrọ ihe ahụ.
However, there are still some questions surrounding her demise left unanswered.	Otu o sila dị, a ka nwere ajụjụ ụfọdụ gbara ọkpụrụkpụ banyere ọnwụ ya azaghị.
Did Aisha Survive the Suicide Mission?	Aisha ọ gbanarịrị igbu onwe ya?
Few days after reactions followed Aisha's suicide action, it went viral on social media that she survived the attempt to commit suicide.	Ụbọchị ole na ole igbu ọchụ nke Aisha wuchara, ọ gbasara na soshal midia na ọ gbanarịrị ọnwụ ahụ.
The source of the rumour is traceable to the post on the Facebook page of Ahmadu Bello University, Samaru, Zaria.	Ihe kpatara asịrị ahụ bụ nke a ga-achọpụta n'ihe ntinye dị na 'Facebook' peeji nke Mahadum Ahmadu Bello, Samaru, Zaria.
The post, which has more than a thousand shares and likes have made many Nigerians wonder whether she really survived her suicide mission.	Ihe ntinye ahụ, nke ihe karịrị puku mmadụ tinyere ma nwee mmasị e meela ka ọtụtụ ndị Naịjirịa na-échè ma ọ gbanarịrị ọchụ ahụ (igbu onwe ya).
However, the picture attached to the Facebook post, showing Aisha in the hospital receiving treatment is the first fact that falsifies the rumours.	Otu o sila dị, foto a bụ nke e tinyere na 'Facebook', na-egosi Aisha n'ụlọ ọgwụ ebe ọ na-anata ọgwụgwọ bụ eziokwu mbụ gosiri na asịrị ahụ bụ ụgha.
This is because the said picture was posted on Twitter sometime in October 2018, when Aisha was said to have had an accident.	Nke a bụ n'ihi na otu foto a bụ nke e tinyere na 'Twitter' n'ime ọnwa Ọktoba 2018, mgbe e kwuru na Aisha nwere ihe mberede.
The rumour was further falsified by eye-witnesses who witnessed how Aisha died and was buried.	Asịrị ahụ bụ ụgha ka onye hụrụ ihe mere na-ekwu etu Aisha siri nwụọ e were lie ya.
Audu Abdulqudus, a recent graduate of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria and close friend to Aisha affirmed that he was among many others who were present at her funeral on the same day she committed suicide.	Audu Abdulqudus, onye gụsịrị akwụkwọ na Mahadum Ahmadu Bello, Zaria na ezigbo enyi Aisha si kweta na ya so n'ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ bịara mmemme olili ozu ya n'otu ụbọchị ahụ o gburu onwe ya.
I was the main friend that carried her dead body the very day she died at the Jamaa hospital in Samaru.	Abụ m enyi ya buuru ozu ya ụbọchị ahụ ọ nwụrụ n'ụlọ ọgwụ Jamaa dị na Samaru.
I and her [best friend's father], Mr AbdulGaniu with two policemen took her to the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital mortuary.	Mụ na ezigbo enyi nna ya, Maazị AbdulGaniu na ndị uweojii abụọ kpọgara ya n'ụlọ ozu nke ụlọọgwụ Mahadum Ahmadu Bello.
I was called by Maryam Salami, Aisha's childhood friend on Thursday evening towards 4:00pm.	Maryam Salami, enyi nwaanyị Aisha kpọrọ m na mgbede Tọzdee ebe elekere anọ nke mgbede.
So, it was Maryam that now told me about the mum telling her that they were at the mortuary and they wanted to go and bury her that very evening on Thursday.	Yabụ, ọ bụ Maryam gwara m na nne ya na-agwa ya na ha nọ n'ụlọ ozu ahụ na ha chọrọ ịga lie ya na mgbede Tọọzde ahụ.
When contacted, Maryam Salami, a childhood friend of Aisha confirmed the death of her bosom friend, adding that Aisha's death was mysterious.	Mgbe a kpọtụụrụ, Maryam Salami, enyi nwaanyị Aisha mgbe ha dị n'obere kwupụtara ọnwụ ezigbo enyi ya, na-agbakwunye na ọnwụ Aisha bụ ihe dị omimi.
We don't know what to say.	Anyị amaghị ihe anyị ga-ekwu.
That's how God planned her own death; let's just put it that way,' she said.	Nke ahụ bụ ka Chineke si zubere ọnwụ nke ya; ka anyị tinye ya ụzọ ahụ,' o kwuru.'
Also, one Ruth Omole who was at Samaru hospital where Aisha gave up the ghost affirmed that Aisha did not survive the incident.	Ọzọ, Ruth Omole onye nọ n'ụlọ ọgwụ Samaru ebe Aisha nwụrụ kwupụtara na Aisha nwụrụ na ihe ahụ merenụ. 
What to Note on the Suicide Note	ihe a ga-arịba ama na ndetu igbu onwe ya
The note left by Aisha about the cause of her suicide has created lots of controversies; there seems some mysterious issues thematically in the note.	Ihe e deturu nke Aisha hapụrụ maka ihe mere o jiri gbuo onwe ya kpatara ọtụtụ arụmụka; ọ dị ka e nwere ụfọdụ ihe omimi dị n'ederede ahụ.
The impression generally created in the letter was that Aisha's parents frustrated and repressed her so much that they made her 'not to believe in God anymore', most especially her mother.	Ederede ahụ gosiri na ndị mụrụ Aisha nwere kụdara mmụọ ya nke ukwuu nke ha mere ya ka 'ọ ghara ikwere na Chukwu ọzọ', karịchaa nne ya.'
As indicated in the note, Aisha frowned at how her mother so much rejected and dejected her while she was alive.	Dịka e gosiri na ihe ndetu ahụ, Aisha gbarụrụ ihu banyere etu nne ya siri jụ ya nke ukwuu mgbe ọ dị ndụ.
According to the note, she (her mother) would blame her for everything and even called her a witch.	Dịka ederede ahụ siri kwuo, ọ (nne ya) ga-ata ya ụta maka ihe ọbụla ma kpọọ ya onye amoosu.
Though all efforts to reach any of her parents proved abortive, the deceased's childhood friend, Maryam Salami, first confirmed that Aisha was the original author of the letter.	N'agbanyeghị mbọ niile a gbara inweta ndị mụrụ ya bụ nke kụrụ afọ n'ala, ọ bụ enyi onye ahụ nwụrụ anwụ bụ Maryam Salami bu ụzọ gosi na Aisha bụ onye dere akwụkwọ ozi ahụ.
Aisha wrote that letter.	Aisha bụ onye dere akwụkwọ ozi leta ahụ.
That's her handwriting,' she affirmed.	Ọ bụ aka edemede ya, o kwusiri ike.
She, however, added that the interpretation of the note could best be conveyed by its author.	Ọ gbakwụnyere na nkọwa ihe e deturu bụ onye dere ya kwesiri ịkọwa.'
Half of what she said could be true and could not be true.	Ọkara ihe o kwuru nwere ike ịbụ eziokwu ma nwee ike ịbụ asị.
It's a personal issue and we should leave it personal.	Ọ bụ okwu dịịrị onwe.
In that letter, she said something that has to do with herself and her mother or people around her.	N’akwụkwọ ozi ahụ, o kwuru ihe metụtara onwe ya na nne ya maọbụ ndị gbara ya gburugburu.
We shouldn't interfere.	Anyị ekwesighi igbochi ya.
That letter said a lot.	Akwụkwọ ozi ahụ kwuru ọtụtụ ihe.
I know what that letter means, but I don't want to say anything.	Ama m ihe akwụkwọ ozi ahụ pụtara, mana achọghị m ikwu ihe ọbụla.
That letter should just be left.	E kwesiri ịhapụ akwụkwọ ozi leta ahụ.
That letter is nothing.	Leta ahụ abụghị ihe ọbụla.
People should just let bygone be bygone.	Ndị mmadụ kwesiri íwè ihe gara aga dịka ihe gara aga.
We should just pray for her and God should forgive all of us, she said.	Anyị kwesiri ikpere ya ekpere, ma rịọ Chineke ka ọ gbaghara anyị niile, o kwuru. 
Were religious differences ever a barrier between Aisha and her parents?	Ndịiche dị n'okpukpe a bụ ihe mgbochi n'etiti Aisha na ndị mụrụ ya?
Salami said religion could not have been the apple of discord.	Salami kwuru na okpukpe enweghị ike ịbụ nsogbu nke esemokwu.
This is contrary to what has been widely spread on social media.	Nke a megidere ozi gbasara na soshal midia.

The legal document also notes that “the Commission reserves the right to amend and review this Determination at any time, as well as to consider other options to incentivise the communications industry,” and not the ministry.

In the formulation of this Determination, it was gathered that the banks had applied to the NCC for USSD codes for their mobile transactions, where they were now directed to the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) independently.	na mmebe Mkpebi nke a, emere ka a mata na ụlọakụ edeela akwụkwọ gara ndị NCC maka akara USSD nke eji akwụ ụgwọ site n'ekwentị, ebe enyere ha ikike ugbua nyere Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) nke nọọrọ onwe ya.
Meanwhile, ALTON’s accounts of how the USSD usage by the banks began and the support of the Commission in allowing the banks to use the USSD platform to facilitate digital financial inclusion is also revealing in the document obtained by The Guardian.

According to ALTON, while telecommunication services and infrastructure became more accessible in the country, the banks identified the USSD channel as a cost-efficient way of delivering financial services to their customers.

However, “following complaints by its customers with regard to disappearing/illegal airtime deductions, ALTON said there was a consensus with the banks to implement corporate billing where the banks absorbed the costs associated with deploying the USSD platform for financial services.
